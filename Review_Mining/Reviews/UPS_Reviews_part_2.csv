good,"The UPS Store"
good,"A typical day at work was hardwork ,uptempo, and organization.I learned how to lift comftorably without straining my back.Management ws awesome took care of us employees"
good,"Sometimes you can't keep up with the flow of the truck. That's when things get messy and your supervisor starts to get on your back. This can be avoided at times but what I've learned from this job experience is that you can be punished for situations that were out of your control. I just keep remembering that no matter how unfairly I've been reprimanded, I only need to push it aside and take steps forward to achieve my purpose."
good,"Working for Ups on a day to day you get to learn and experience a lot. I get to experience multiple operation and business aspects of the company. We meet new people everyday and learn what they like about the company and why they chose Ups to work for. We process in the enter that I'm in anywhere from 20,000-60,000 packages In a day. Its very fast paced and skilled job."
good,"A worldwide company with majority of its hourly employees governed by a collected bargaining agreement (Union). Most but not all transportation companies that provide the same services have a union labor work force. I experienced most of my hourly coworkers wanted to come to work on time every day, work efficiently and go home safe to their families."
good,"It takes time to reap the benefits of working there.  You start off as a part time and once your seniority builds up you can make it a full time job.  Once your full time, pay is very good.  But the wait list in some places are long and may take several years until your chance comes."
good,"Gutes Gehalt, dennoch sind die Arbeitszeiten ganz unpassend."
good,"Be prepared:"
good,Ok place to work. No room for growth with company. Hardest part working was working with personnel and management. I learned the ins and outs of getting through day after day at work while working here.
good,"Average Work average pay. Part time mostly ,hard to be a driver more work then pay. If u need a quick part time. Typical night fast pace."
good,"I can't believe I wasted 11 years 4 months with thinking my efforts would accumulate to something, but the reality in the end was I was expendable.Be careful of your associates cause they will attempt to deviate you from your goals or purpose.Stay focused on your objectives that what I've done.Originally I signed into a contract for 10 years still the economy was so bad I chose to leave once I noticed the quality of co-workers  had diminished.Not a bad job if your willing to go combo which was full time."
good,"Typical day at UPS includes but not limited to, sorting packages, loading trailers and unloading trailers."
good,"The job is as one dimensional as possible and the bosses micro manage you. I went into trucks and unloaded them onto an extendable conveyor, they suggested 1200 packages per hour. You have to move irregular packages that can be 70 to 150 pounds into a chute out on the dock."
good,I enjoyed working at ups but the managers were not understanding. I had to find something better because the job didn't allow me to grow.
good,ok. place to work. managers and supervisors have a hard time being on the same page. dress code is ridiculous making men shave their entire face takes away from their character. UPS is only about UPS and not the employees....
good,"Leuke werkomgeving en leuke collega's."
good,"Very easy with taking discretionary/sick/personal days and good place to work for people who like structured schedules that have families. Bad thing is it is hard to advance, especially without a degree."
good,"loader and package handler"
good,A typical day at work is very stressful physically. You spend the majority of the time loading and unloading without minimal breaks. Job was physically demanding. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the conveyor belt which is basically impossible. Most enjoyable part was sorting and light days.
good,"United Parcel Service gives good benefits to its employees including school, insurance, stock program, and vacation time. The schedule is not ideal, but the work is not that hard either, so it is a balance."
good,"UPS is a factory workplace where people there can have job security and stability, however, because of the potential dangers in the workplace safe should be a first priority, however it is not."
good,"good place to work but very competitive, leadership teams are supportive and helpful.  It is very hassle place to work.  Coworkers sometime are not friendly type and not willing to help that much."
good,Typical work day would start at 3:30am. Unloading and sorting postal mail. Then at around 5:00am we would begin unloading and staging freight to their proper locations. By 7:00am we would begin loading trucks with freight for distribution for our drivers and out the door by 8:30 and sometimes 10:00am.
good,"Delivering boxes at a fast pace to different houses, requires physical conditioning because of a lot of running. Overall a simple job but with physical requirements."
good,"Its a nice job, just too far and not worth sleepless days. Its Unorganized but have a very understandable management. Nice co-workers and all, but nobody really believes in teamwork."
good,Not the best has favorites.  No room for advance.  Not an open door policy. Needs to give more perks and acknowledge their employees for hard work.
good,"Smistavo i miei pacchi li caricavo sul mio furgone e andavo in consegna con orari tassativi da rispettare in quanto c'erano negozi e quindi chiusure ad una certa ora , centri di lavoro."
good,"Difficult company to work for.  Day starts at 8:30 am, always have to finish loading my truck, which causes me to get a late start.  Run around like a crazy person the first 90 minutes in order to get Next Day Air packages delivered by 10:30 am.  By this time I have about 40 delivery stops completed with about 150 to go.  4:00 pm, it's time to start pickups, which means I have to stop delivering with usually 50-60 deliveries left. After 30 minutes of pickups, it's time to head back to delivering until 6:00 pm. At 6:00 pm, it's time to pick up the 100 or so packages from the UPS store, then back to finish the 20 or so deliveries that remain.  7:30 pm usually finds me back at the depot where it's time to unload the 100's of pick up pieces, leaving me to punch out around 8:00-8:30 pm.  Long days, no time for family, it's exhausting."
good,"A place that allow employees to grow within the company if the employee desires to. Also a very friend place to work at, but overall not bad."
good,"Hated this company, worked for them for 16 years and the Management from top to bottom were horrible.  I would call this company military not UPS"
good,çok hareketli bir iş ve bende hareketli işi severim zamanın nasıl geçtiğini anlamadıgım bir iş ti ama çalışma saatleri çok uzun
good,UPS is a great starter job for someone young and not sure what they want to do with their life.  It requires hard work and takes you out of your comfort zone.
good,I liked the people I worked with and enjoyed the atmosphere and running packages never got boring. Though with no place to go the bathroom and working for 5 hours with no lunch break was not particularly enjoyable.
good,"Started off as a seasonal and got hired on after two months, at first is was good but then you see how much you work for very little pay."
good,"A fun work place that allowed me to exercise my problem solving techniques in a unique way. "
good,"I learned many good things in the 12 years I have worked for UPS Freight.  I learned how to manage small and large groups of people, how to be productive and manage for numbers and revenue.  I learned to work with a variety of different people and learned how to make them all respond well in the work place to provide productive results.  I'm ready for a new challenge and seeking a career opportunity.  Ups isn't the place for me to retire."
good,ups is a fast-pace company. there is always something to do and you have the opportunity to grow in the company. The staff is great and they are always willing and available to help and train their new staff.
good,"Part of incentive administration department for Germany   Responsible for creating proxy contracts based on customer requests from Germany     "
good,"Decent work and life balance (depending on your job title), fair pay for fair work, good benefits, Safety first culture."
good,with the position i held i managed to learn more about how the job worked. the fafctory is filled with interesting employees. the most enjoyable part of the job wa seeing all pf the packages people where going to receive.
good,it was fun to me because it was competitive work and i got to work with friend and actually make a pay check for the first time a good experience for a guy my age
good,"as a company, UPS as a company pays well but depending on what department you are in, some Management may listen to what you have to say regarding issues and concerns, but they don't always or for the most part take action,"
good,"I would unload at least twelve package cars. A four shift monday thru friday. An hour break, a laid back kind of job. I had to lines i was responsible for but i was always counted by managers, because they knew I always got the job done."
good,Working with this company was great and I learned a lot from them! I had a great and worthwhile time working with them! I would recommend this place to work.
good,It was enjoyable to work here because I was able to do many different tasks all in one day.  I would cook the food as well as serve the customers.  I loved working with the people and it felt like a real family.
good,"United Parcel Service- Anaheim Hub. There are two shifts at UPS, Sunrise and Twilight. If an employee worked Sunrise, Sundays were taken up by resting. If an employee worked Twilight, Friday nights were taken up by working  I worked the twilight shift at UPS for a couple of years as a package handler, unloading package cars and trailers. The motto at UPS was ""Work with a workout"", which meant I could exercise while working. Typical day/evening was unloading package cars starting with heavily loaded vehicles to light load vehicles. Each employee had to maintain a package per hour. I think 900 packages per hour was the minimum or close to. Management would distribute the productive employees to help out the slower employees finish unloading their assigned cars and work area. Supervisors were pretty fair about distributing overtime among employees and if you had time off accrued and needed to take a day off, they would allow it. The most difficult part of the job was if I finished my normal line of trucks, with some extra trucks to unload, a supervisor would relocate me to trailer side to help unload the trailers to meet downtime. I wouldn't go home until 11 pm when I started at 3 pm. Then there's peak season. The week after the Thanksgiving weekend is when package count tripled if not more before Christmas. It was a month and a half of insanity when it came to loading and unloading packages. The hours I would work were from 3 PM to 2 AM the next morning. But I was getting a workout, which is what I enjoyed most about this job."
good,"Four hours a night, the job consists of consistent packaging of boxes and handling irregular packages weighing from 50 to 150 lbs."
good,It is a very fun and productive place to work but very stressful to supervise. A lot of pressure and problems to solve every day!

good,it was alright company. if your going to college thats the place to be. great benfits. low hrs. management was ok not the best.
good,"Review prior shift activities with who I am replacing."
good,...in the air department. Interesting outside job. Good for students: Part time w/ decent wage. Hours are early mornings and evenings.
good,clock in and get my scanner and wait for the boxes to come down the line scan them and load them on the truck. if they are big boxes i put them to the side till the end of the day then i put them in where ever they can fit.
good,"I got fired for not being able to prove self defense because my supervisor did not like me but I would go back if I could. "
good,I enjoy the atmosphere of this store and the people who are employe there.  I am expected to complete tasks so keep records up to date and financials reconciled.
good,Good environment to work as a student with flexible scheduling. Not much room for advancement as this is at Store level. Good being able to work shifts with like-minded people and sharing responsibilities to work together.
good,Meeting new clients and working on my own and problem solving on a daily basis. Driving to new far away places and enjoying going over what UPS could do to help new businesses out with easy package pick up.
good,"Your typical day at work would consist of loading or unloading trucks. I learned about the cornerstone that allows a strong foundation for walls (packages.) My supervisor knew I was a hard-worker so, he would send me to different areas to help other workers to either pack, or unload freight trucks. The hardest part was maintaining the work flow; If I unloaded fast, the sorter would tell me to slow down, and if I went to slow, the supervisor would end up looking over my shoulder, making the job more difficult. the most enjoyable part was the 15-minute break we had  for the 4 hours we had to work."

good,"Fast paced environment, great company to work for. Plenty of well season managers to provide guidance and insight into the day-to-day activities of the company."
good,"The package handler position at UPS was for me a means to an end.  The pay was appropriate for the work. However, climbing the company ladder from this position probably will not happen."
good,"Hard warehouse working environment. Tons of dirt and dust. What ever the weather is outside, its twice as bad inside. Great for a part time job, flexible hours, great benefits. Terrible manegment, they hire supervisors from employees who have only been there for a month or two which means they don't have any clue on how to correctly run their area. This results in an extremely high turn over rate for both new employees and supervisors."
good,working at UPS has enhanced my abilities to leaned logistic and to work on fast pace I enjoying working with this company it was always fun to see  relationship and the respect  I have for my peers and management .
good,Can be a good place to work. Do not go into management there. Some of the shift hours are unfavorable like starting work at 2am. Good benefits.

I enjoyed merging the practical implementation with the overall corporate objectives.  I had the opportunity to train, audit, recruit in mass, and participate in many new programs and initiatives."

good,the biggest responsibility as a preload Supervisor is the training of my new employees.  Especially when it comes to working safely.  Safety is my first priority.
good,"Typical work day would be to come in and have immediate work to do, form loading to unloading trucks and making sure it was done in a timely fashion. My co-workers made the day go by a lil better and the worst part about the job was the labor to pay ratio."
good,as a women in this field its not a easy job for use to do I feel that this job is for a man only its very heard for a women to pick up most of the packages that they receive
good,"I have learned so much from working at the UPS store, about UPS services, postal services, international shipping, and many office skills. I truly enjoy helping customers efficiently and according to their individual needs. I hear them say, ""One-stop shop,"" often because of all the various services we offer, and it makes me happy when they leave happy. I do enjoy this job, but I am finding it difficult to survive on my current wage."
good,UPS is an OK job to work for. I gained a lot of experiences working for this company. The only hard part about working here is lifting and timing.
good,typical day at work consists of hard labor of loading boxes at a fast rate. I learned how to shipping business works and what it takes to get packages delivered to customers on time.
good,"very hard work for little pay, hot climates in the summer, cold in the winter, not much chance to improve or go up the ladder in the company based on your work"
good,Met a lot of people here. Even on less than busy days many people would come. All of them had their own story to say. Some even tipped for helping them.
good,"I loved coming to this job daily..IIt was seasonal, very disappointed when the season was over.  During my day I would be responsible for loading, unloading and sorting packages by hand."
good,There is a heavy feeling of non-acknowledgement and under appreciation. The call center feels somber and sad.  I have been here more than 5 years and have not seen it change yet.
good,"ok place to work, will teach all the basis for future employment; responsibility, money skills, customer service and such"
good,"* Managing the inbounds and outbound freight to allow us to meet the cut off times. Monitoring the loading of the freight to endure damage wouldn't occur during the travel to the next destination. "
good,"Winter time was very cold. Summer time was very hot."
good,"Got a lot of hands on experience, work with clients and figuring out what they needed and what I could provide to them."
good,"During My Time at UPS i learned to work efficiently under time limits and communicating with others around me to get the job done without too much stress on my body. However, the only way they would pay for school was to work 3rd shift."
good,At the start of the shift i would open up the building then start the computer processes to obtain printed COD notes and invoices for the drivers then make sure each van had the correct paperwork for the day's deliveries and to ensure everything was ready for the start of the main shift at 2 o'clock. When the shift was over it was my job to chase up any missing COD packages that may slipped through the net saving the company in lost revinue
good,"alles is prima geregeld."

good,"Bom aprendizado,  serviu muito para um crescimento profissional"
good,"Just looking for something much more challenging and applicable to utilized my skills. I've learned a great deal about the explicit functions within the company, but have more inadvertently learned about how to manage my professionalism when dealing with over bearing criticism."
good,"I'm willing to admit that I hit this job hard and did what I could at all times to wear myself out because quite frankly, I had my fair share of things to prove.  I was young, a bit brash, and angry at the world for no reason in particular.  I was able to vent that at this job and it did me wonders for the time that I needed it.  Once I wasn't trying to use sheer physicality to take out overly angry energy I no longer felt, the job no longer had luster to me.  This was also only part time and I needed longer hours.  I needed a full time job."
good,It's not a bad job. It is physically demanding so your strength and endurance will be put to the test. This position is more beneficial for the younger crowd (ages 18-30).
good,"S' morgens na aankomst help je mee met de auto laden. plus/minus 1uur. Daarna moet ik zelfstandig een route maken ivm verschillende routes rijden. Hierbij moet rekening gehouden worden met tijddruk en leveringen voor 1200 en 1700."
good,Every night I was to clock in 15 minutes before start time. I had to ensure all of my equipment was working and my workplace was clean. All prior labels had to be removed.
good,"Not bad, the constant battle between union employees and management gets old though. It does offer a lot of experience and room for advancement."
good,"UPS is a great job for anyone looking to go to school and work at the same time. If you can balance school and working at least 4 to 5 hours a day then UPS can be an option for you. The workflow depending on the area can range from decent to extremely heavy. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep us with the flow on certain days of the week, but don't be discouraged, if you fall behind UPS management will find someone to help you at the end of the day. Management at UPS is not the strongest I've seen in a company, the main problem is the lack of communication from area to area. However if you're just looking for a part-time job to get you through school then UPS is a considerably job choice."
good,"Pros:"
good,"working here was experience, i learned a lot  about working in mail-room environment, assisting customer with pick ups or sending packages. also working on a truck helping out the driver"
good,U.P.S is a very fast pace environment with a lot of things going on at one time.

good,"Typical work day consist of Recording each outbound shipment using the proper paperwork before leaving the warehouse."

good,"Fair minded employer, great place for younger employees starting out in the work force.   Nice benefits.  Not a lot of opportunity for advancement, or full time employment."
good,"Load and unload trucks with data entry of boxes shipped"
good,"Good workers are overworked, underpaid, and management is not great as far as following rules. They stress safety, but production was more important. Sometimes they rushed you to get work done despite breaking packages."
good,A lot of work to be done in extreme heat or cold weather. Co workers were fun to work with and managers were helpful if you needed to leave at certain times or had to start later than others.
good,"UPS is an exceptional company, just would like the benefits to come within 90 days instead of 12 months! Maybe a better pay, Example: $11.00"

good,"Good Job overall, it can be beneficial, but you can also get caught up in the rat race.  You can get lost very easily in this company with or without a degree."
good,"Many people would describe this job as stressful, as I was required to deviler about 250 packages and pick up about 150 packages a day, with about 120 stops each day. However, I thrive under these circumstances as I find joy in finding ways to do whatever job I do as fast AND efficient as possible. On top of the busy day, I was required to be back at the establishment at 19:00 every day because of the busy schedule of a company like UPS that needs to keep all the packages moving."
good,"I am in management, having to deal with customers, and locating their packages, whether its lost, or on the driver truck. Co workers at ups is very friendly, sociable, and easy to get along with.

good,Working for ups has taught me a lot i can say because i have to meet the requirements and be smart about how i do my work in the process
good,Carrying boxes from conveyor belt to the trucks gets very exhausting very fast. One has to work in a fast pace and be able to carry heavy boxes.

good,"a typical day at work is going in and unloading trucks, what I learned is that if you want the job done everybody has to work together. the management at the job is well productive, not like the co-workers. the hardest part of the job is not being able to listen to music, but the most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to go home after all is done."
good,Early morning shifts form 2:00 am-11:00 am. I would go in and immediately start grabbing packages from the belt and placing them in assigned cages. For the first six hours transferring from belt to belt where I am needed. The last two hours hours where stocking the  UPS trucks. The coworkers would talk during intermissions of the loads but the hardest part of the job was an over flow of packages that needed to be placed onto the oncoming cages. The most enjoyable part was clocking out knowing that i earned every dollar I made.
good,"Prepare, organize and sort letter size, small, medium and large boxes/packages delivered via vans, cargo trucks, tractor trailers and aircrafts across the United States and Canada.

Great co workers at employee level, ready and willing to work hard and follow instruction. Dealing with management. Benefits"
good,"I learned allot at UPS. Including how to work in a hot environment, how to push my self to my best abilities. The Part- Time Supervising were annoying, and not very trained well. I enjoyed my Co-workers they were very productive and I made some friends as well. But UPS is definitely not a job for a college student who has no car."
good,I currently clear shipments through customs.  I like to stay busy and am a very high producer.  The has been room for advancement.  They have been flexible as an employer.
good,I worked as a Tug driver for several years on the night shift to pay for college. Boring and awful when weather got bad. But anything bad I might have to say is washed away by the fact that I have zero student loans thanks to their benefits package.
good,"I worked for the company for 15+ years, many of those years were in management. As an employee I worked tons of hours and was supervised by individuals with no experience in the company. Later in management I learned how the company steals and degrades its employees. I cant get into it but watch your paycheck... 2/3 minutes missing from your timecard may not seem like much to you but its still stealing!"
good,This company is a good productive and fast pace workplace but the pay for the job wasn't a match for me. I wish the employee's the best of luck there.
good,"Overall it was a GREAT job, great staff and bosses. Hardest part of the job was there scheduling hours that were not mentioned in the shadowing of the job and my school hours whitch were clashing. The most enjoyable part of the job was deffinitly coming in and seeing co-workers."
good,Be prepared to work 3rd shift. Come in at 1am till 5am. But after you work 3hours you get overtime. The hardest part is changing sleep schedules.
good,"Its fast paced. But it provides a great workout. I learned that its 10% physical and 90% mental. Some of the management are fun to work for. Some of the employees who i work with are nice, hard working people, and its been a pleasure working with them. The hardest part of the job is when people let their ego's run them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who care."
good,"no consistent work schedule with little to no organization on a day to day process.  Trainees were used, abused and taken total advantage of with no appreciation."
good,"This job is by no means easy and never will be. I learned that in the very first week I  worked there. The physical load is crushing but after the first month you get used to it. This jobs will drain you physically, mentally, and stress you out even if you've been there for a while. After that it all comes down to mental toughness. If you can work here and work hard day after day, then you can do anything. That's where I'm at with this job. I can do it no problem, no complaints everyday,but I need a change of scenery. Everyone at UPS is miserable and hates their job ( obviously there is exceptions) and I don't want to be here content with where I'm at in life just because of benefits and a yearly raise. I want to enjoy, no, love my job and at UPS I'd just be stuck here. This job is a steeping stone for me to get to the next level in my life, It's a good job to have, but there are better jobs out there for me."
good,Worked here part-time for about 6 months.  Great pay for part-time.  Management not real friendly and never spoke to me.  Good benefits.
good,I would arrive at work and be given packages with my driver to deliver.  The driver would drop me off with a cart and packages and I would go door to door delivering packages.  I learned to deliver packages with efficiency and to provided excellent customer service.  The management were kind.  My co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to be with.  The hardest part of the job was delivering outside during the winter.  The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering to the customers and seeing them happy when they got their packages.
good,"Had a good time working for UPS, But the pay & hours that they give you aren't good at all. I only worked here for about a month, Then I moved onto my next job which is Fedex."
good,"its a dead-end job, but great benefits when you commit to a year.  The worst part are the minimal hours combined with the unprofessional supervisors."
good,was not a fan of the union which ultimately led me to leave lots of guys were fired before even in the union for example work 29 days then fired before the 30th when your considered part of the union lots of screaming instead of encouragement
good,Worked in a warehouse distribution center: very high pace energetic atmosphere: worked 4-6 hour shifts: worked early morning shift 4am til 9am
good,Being an assistant driver was very enjoyably. The driver was good to work with and trained me well. Fast paced but good work. Supervisor was good to work under.
good,The is a good paying job with benefits but you will sacrifice your home life with the hours that you work.  A standard 10 hour + day that teaches you to keep pushing through to get the job done.
good,"It was a very fast paced environment.  I learned how to lift properly and also learned how to load a UPS truck.  I learned a lot about logistics just the only downfall is advancement in this industry.  Its based on seniority, so to become a driver is the waiting game and It was going to be awhile for me to try and qualify to become one and also i had second thoughts that I even wanted to become one.  The co workers were great to work with.  It was a fun environment every day as well and got donuts most Friday mornings."
good,"I basically scanned the mail and place it on the moving belt. For 4 hours, scanning around 2,000 mail was a good day. During the summer time working there, it was very hot environment to work in."
good,Always on the move keeping track of time. Having to have patience with the costumers and gaining access to enter apt buildings.Dealing with the weather conditions and making sure the package was delivered to a responsible person
good,"-  Work is manageable but picks up during peak seasons"
good,Trabajo en dpto. facturación como sustitución de vacaciones. Buen ambiente y buenos compañeros de trabajo.
good,"Great QA experience, work environment, co-workers. Developed my QA career with UPS, I was exposed to a lot of QA tools and new technology."
good,"All of the drivers were very friendly, and always positive and taught me everything i needed to know in a very understandable manor."
good,"Once you have clocked in and set up the trailers to start loading, since the building is very old and the daily volume of packages surpasses the amount the building can handle creates a huge mess withing the trailer and the floor. I have learned that at the end of the day, they are just packages and that the job is going to be done one way or another. Sometimes management is great and sometimes they will pull out people from your work station and end up having twice the amount of work. Some co-workers can be very helpful and are good at their job and some co-workers completely slack off and makes you do all the work. The hardest part of the job is that by the end of the shift the whole building is a mess with packages on the floor and end up cleaning up way after the shift is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it keeps you on your feet and moving around a lot. You can consider this job a place to work out and get paid at the same time."
good,"My typical work day consists of sorting the packages,loading  and securing the packages from the belt unto the trucks."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. Everyone is friendly, but sometimes the customers can be very rude. Every day was something new and different to experience."
good,"Monotone Arbeit mit hervorragendem Arbeitsklima."

good,"Always something to learn, and a very fast paced environment with many facets of the business to learn. New challanges make this position a true place to grow."
good,be prepared to work hard everyday. very fast paced environment that requires for individual production levels to improve over time. hardest part of job is standing on feet all day...
good,"I only worked here for a month during the Christmas rush, what little I do remember are the challenges of moving heavy boxes off the trucks and sometimes into the homes of customers across central Florida. Being a driver's assistant really helped me to use my team work skills to get sometimes cluttered trucks of parcels into the welcoming hands of customers everywhere."
good,"not much to say, it was hard work just for part time and i did that part time for way to long so i had to  further my search for a full time job to provide for my growing family , the benifets where good but that was the only perks of the job"
good,"Work could be fun or work could be hard. everyday was a different day. "
good,Lifting and hot conditions. They work wit you on hours and various shifts available. Great start for high school graduates.
good,I liked the amount of money that you can make. You get tired of lifting boxes after but the coworkers make it fun. I didn't like lifting boxes over 50 pounds. I learned how to work with packages and how to be safe inside the facility.
good,"With the diversity of the work place and staff, the issues that would be thought of as existent do not exist!  Everyone that I encountered have been very helpful, supportive, informative and friendly!"
good,it was alot of excercise with keeping alot of work flow going
good,There really isn't a typical day at Toys R Us since from the moment you clock in you can expect to be really busy and manage multiple positions. While working at Toys R Us I'd say I learned to effectively multitask since you do anything under the sun from checking out customers to demoing toy cars or answering phones. Management is pretty good here as well. Everyone is professional but still friendly and helpful. They train you right the first time so once you got it you got it. The co workers were good as well. Everyone seemed like family or good friends even though most of us just met. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the holiday rush and still being on the look out for possible theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the look on the kids faces who got the toy the wanted or the parents relief when they were able to find everything on their list.
good,"A typical day at U.P.S. for me consisted of being put wherever I was needed, you don't usually stay in one spot and you have to move very quickly. The hardest part of the job would be when they put you somewhere and didn't train you it was like they just expected you to know the job and this happened ever so often, but since I am a quick learner I got it down it was just quite annoying. The most enjoyable would be when you got into a groove with whatever job you were doing a groove to where you weren't underwhelmed or overwhelmed it was steady and i enjoyed that quite a bit. I got along with all of my co-workers, it was very easy to talk to them because you would always end up helping each other if it was needed, its a you watch my back and i watch yours kind of deal. As for the management I didn't deal with them. But, I did learn how to load, unload, sort, and package while being there."
good,"Centre d'appels en Irlande - Dublin"
good,"co-workers extremely helpful."
good,"I first started working at the UPS store in the summer of 2013. I learned a lot through this occupation due to the customer service position I was offered. I had the opportunity to work on my ability to communicate with customers whether it was simply helping them ship packages or even finding a solution to any problems or issues the customer may have had. I was also given the opportunity to do some graphic design as well, this challenged my creativity and ability to impress each customer."
good,"Processed packages for shipping. Gift wrapping, customer service. I worked alone which was the hard part of my job"
good,not a good job in the winter very cold. always running will be busy. must be able to withstand weather.
good,Seasonal hardwork position Deliver packages as the driver passes them to you
good,"helped members use weight machines; cleaned entire room, all weight machines and weights"
good,Very stressful working environment under lot of pressure and heavy boxes
good,"Very fast pace environment, makes the workday go by quick.  Full time management have very long days at least at large facilities."
good,"Very simple but required a lot of general labor. The hardest part of the job was when you have to carry several boxes of multiple addresses and making sure you do not get them mixed up. I enjoyed this job because it was a fast paced work environment, my co-workers were great and overall it was very simple."
good,"Graag zou ik mijzelf willen voorstellen als zelfstandige , enthousiaste jonge vrouw die weet wat zij wil."
good,"While training, drivers were very efficient. Learned that U.P.S. is a very responsible company to work for. Treats trainees with respect."
good,co workers and manger very nice made long time friends got really busy during holidays and pay was decent could of been better.
good,a typical day you get called and told to meet a driver in a location. Very hard labor
good,UPS had really good benefits and decent pay for the short hours I worked. The management was not very good and not very well trained. The main manager was never there and had no clue with what was going on. Their is also no real chance of advancement. I had this job while going to school. It was a great job while going to school but very few hours when school was out.
good,I love it. Very good supervisor and co-workers. It is a great company too work for.
good,"Truck Handler	May 2008 – June 2009"
good,"A typical day at work I lead a team from 8-14 employees and hold them accountable to work safe and produce the quality, service, and production standards.  I've learned how to work with others and take ideas that are not my own into consideration whether they are right or wrong. I've learned how to bring the best out of employees. The hardest part of the job is retaining new hires. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co workers."
good,UPS has helped me to build character and strength. It can be very stressful at times but getting over that stress just builds u up. the job is not meant for the mentally weak. my co-workers keep me sane
good,You get to meet a lot of different people on your routes. It is a fast paced environment. They truly do care about your overall safety while on your routes.
good,Typical day was jumping in the ups truck and looking back at your load. Learned a lot about receiving and shipping as well as finding small boxes in a truck full of boxes. My co-worker was a nice guy to work with. Hardest part of the job would be carrying a dolly full of boxes and having to go up or down a set of stairs fearing you'd drop all the deliveries. Most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying driving around the city having conversations with the driver.
good,The warehouse is very management heavy but nothing an average person cant handle. You do have to be a little flexible to work here though. Keep in mind the facility is not climate controlled. Stay safe and be on time. BOTTOM LINE.......Just do your job
good,"Working at UPS is not what i would call fun, it is a great place to work to get in shape and to make good money while doing it but it is not fun at all. The people re good the benefits are great. the only problem I have with this company is its failure to stay organized . I had to wait three weeks to get a check that is suppose to come weekly.I doubt anyone would want to go through that. Other than that Its a great place to work."
good,I like the work. I load packages into big bins. I wasn't very happy with the training. They gave us a lot of information in a very short amount of time.
good,Cannot review. All UPS Stores are different. All UPS Stores have individual owners.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but very hard work. If you like running all day in the elements of the weather this job is for you. Management doesn't care about employees quality of life."
good,Temp position. Short hours. Had to collect undelivered hi risk packages from trucks.
good,Location of Job is in Dallas TX typical consisted of loading trucks
good,This job is very productive during the holiday season. They have four different shifts when I was there back in 2005. Your in a warehouse with no AC or heat but they have heaters and AC units throughout the warehouse.
good,I had a good experience with the company until I broke my ankle I haven't been back to work since I don't know why I am not working with the company I have tried to get back but no luck I would to work with the company again but ever since I got hurt on the job they act different
good,"This was great managerial experience and I learned a lot about time management and customer service. Dealt with customers daily and constantly had to solve problems and think quickly. I was often left at the store by myself and wasn't trained well, but it forced me to learn quickly on my own"
good,While working for this company I learned how physical and competitive this job is. Everyone is friendly to each other and most of the supervisors you build a professional relationship with. You are constantly moving while on the job and always moving at a fast pace.
good,"A typical day at work was very tiring and fast paced. My job was to load packages until I was promoted. Then my job became more mental as well as physical because of the promotion, I was considered a sorter and my responsibility was to make sure that the boxes went to right trailer. I was responsible for many things such as learning zip codes and making sure the loading quality was up to UPS standards."
good,"Ups is a very hard and physical job. I does wear on your body and muscles, but they are pretty good with job security. The bad thing about working part time is only maybe getting 3-4 hours some days if your lucky during non-peak. Come peak season you can expect to get anywhere from 6-8 hours pretty easy. You have to work in very hot conditions during the summer and very cold conditions during the winter. For the most part co-workers aren't too bad, but there are those who are grumpy all the time."
good,The day may consist of loading boxes but it can help you burn the unwanted fat
good,"A typical day at work starts at a time posted every week. After going over some important information of the day, you then perform your designated task for about four hours on an average day."

good,A typical day was unloading eighteen wheelers full of packages. It was pretty hard work. You had to keep moving packages up to 70lbs .
good,"My job consisted of sorting packages to the correct location, or unloading packages to the correct belt to be sorted. Management was great with supervisors that genuinely appreciated the work you did. Coworkers were also generally friendly and hard working. The hardest part of the job was unloading in those trucks in the summer because of the scorching heat. However, I love the job because of the fast paced enviroment and the opportunity for advancement at one's choice."
good,"The good thing is that you get your hours, but the bad thing is that the work is slow and does not give me a challenge because of my experience."
good,Great work environment and lots of support from co-workers and staff.
good,The pay and benefits are great but it's a call center environment.
good,"Nice people. Learned to proof read, scan and edit BOL.  Diverse group of people."
good,I give this company a 3 star. Nothing was a fantastic experience
good,"very easy, just didn't always get all the hours that I wanted but it kept me busy."
good,On a typical day I am responsible for dispatching and supervising delivery of EAM (Early AM) delivery packages in the Portland Metro area.
good,"On a typical day, I would assist one of the plant engineer to make sure all the packages that were on the conveyor belt is sent to its destination correctly. I've learned how the packages travel down the conveyor belt and all the machinery that makes that happened. The hardest part of the job was that you have to constantly move around on the catwalk. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I get to do hands on with the engineer and mechanics."
good,"You work long hours and work hard, you make good money and have a good pension!"
good,"A typical day at work would be loading 1,500 boxes and running boxes on carts and breaking jams in shoots. I learned how to build walls of boxes and safety rules. The management was unorganized always messing up pays. my Co-workers chose when they wanted to come to work sometimes. Working with someone who is lazy and doesn't pick up their end of the work. Getting paid and getting off early."
good,The work was simple and straight to the point. I learned to get the job done a lot faster with my coworkers doing their part.
good,Had boxes coming down the conveyor belts and had to load the trailer with boxes
good,Hard laboring job. Consist of building and wall up in the freight truck to be shipped off to the next city. Management was pretty standard they'd assist when needed.
good,"This job is stressful but does pay reasonably well. It is very easy to make it to management, but nothing there is as it seems. I lost around 10 to 20 pounds working there without having to change my diet. The best thing about this job is the people you work with."
good,great benefits (ONLY). I really like the job until i learned more about the job. You have to wait 10-12 years just to become full time. Great job for college not for career
good,"I managed 10 employees on a fast paced conveyor belt. Daily duties included managed time clocks, cooperation with Union employees, correct placement of packages in the UPS truck, limiting all errors in outbound deliveries, and ensuring all time sensitive material was delivered and carefully taken care of."
good,"A typical day at work consists of loading packages for delivery."
good,this is an okay place to work. Friendly co workers and decent benefits. Usually stays busy when the local college students are in session.
good,"UPS is a fun place to work, but the hours are long and vacation for non-union employees is less than ideal. Advancement at UPS is more than difficult. It's not going to happen unless management pushes for it. Hard work, and degrees are not enough to move up the ladder there. Christmas and the holiday season are a nightmare, so prepare to work long hours."
good,"This is a hot environment in the summer time, so prepare yourself."
good,"i was only seasonal help, so i felt lost the entire month i was there, but management/owners were very nice and patient with me"
good,Good job out of college but the advancement opportunities are very minimal.
good,"No need for a gym membership working here! The job is repetitive and physically demanding. The best part are the benefits. You are in the union and you do get health benefits for working there. You pay into the union and once you are a member your benefits kick in. The time goes by quick, your there between 3-4 hours a day and you get a break halfway through. I enjoyed working there."
good,overall great experience. Everybody works together as a team to get the job done. Very welcoming staff.Very organized and took pride n a job well done.
good,"UPS does a fairly good job in balancing the high production demands with workers compensation and safety. Career advancements are heavily influenced by timing, economy, and seniority rather than skills sets, work ethic, and performance (union). There are occasional conflicts between the union staff and the non-union management staff but for the most part it is a very productive relationship."
good,A typical day at work is about 7 hours.  I've learned how to deal with customers at a face to face level. Management is very good at helping you test your potential. The hardest part of the job is managing various customers at in a timely fashion.
good,great for u if like to work at night time and its a great side job to have.
good,Get to deal with a lot of people coming in. Gets very busy around the holiday seasons.
good,"A Typical Night at work me and 30 other employees in one work station unload trailers up to 3.5 hours a night 5 days a week."
good,overall good job with great benefits. hard to advance. my co workers were pretty laid back. hardest part of the job was putting up with management. I learned that UPS says your wrong when your right and its better to just keep quiet about then go against the grain
good,"i just breeze threw my day tunning everything out following rules."
good,Here you have to be able to work hard and fast. It`s an ok job in this area but there are better ones. My co-workers were nice and most of the management too.
good,"If you are going to college, it's a good place to earn while you learn."
good,I am a senior software developer for UPS BTT Automation team
good,"Worked midnight shift. Hard labor with little pay. After 7 years I only make $260 a week. Hard to time second job or school during late November and all of December. All workers become full-time during this time because of peak season. Many will double-shift during December and it is very possible to make a quarter of your annual income because that is the only time of the year to make money. It is a job where the benefits (Insurance, College program) greatly outweigh the income."
good,"Dagelijks Werk:"
good,It was great to work for this company. Espcially you are  Dealing with the customers face to face. Fun fast environment.
good,"While during the walk-through, I was told how hard and fast paced the loading/handling position was; but in reality the physical endurance wasn't the hard part.. "
good,"I am a hard worker who thrives for a challenge. I am very competitive and who takes her job serious. I look forward to always learning something new to improve me as a person and as a Supervisor. I believe a person can never stop receiving training and knowledge because it can only make us better.  "
good,Fast paced and strenuous work place that provided growth opportunities.
good,The job was not easy at all. Did not really know management. Co workers were not friendly and the job is for a young man.
good,A typical day at work consist of counting inventory number while lifting heavy freight. I learned great job ethic. The management would be unreal with the amount of work they wanted me to achieve in a day but I got it done with no complaints. my coworkers treated me with respect every day. The hardest part of the night would be just lifting freight for 4 hours. The best part about the job was the fact that I was getting a free workout.
good,Its the same as working part time at any store in america while one completes his/her education. Does provide a lot of interaction with customers which helps one get out of his/her shell
good,"I did not like the fact that they called you in when they needed you"
good,"The People were good, its just that the physical work of building boxes to create at wall is more physical work is overwhelming."
good,UPS was kinda difficult but it was nice. I learned how the make all the boxes fit in the truck for it to be shipped off. my favorite part was unloading the boxes to get where they needed to go.
good,"Worked here as a Part Time worker inside, loading trucks.  Worked at night, went to school during the day.  This was a Union position, and the benefits were excellent."
good,enjoyed working with them learned the job quickly it was great.
good,UPS is a company that is very fast paced. I have unloaded semi trucks there for almost 2 years.
good,UPS is a stable company that has been around for years and provide a unique product to it's customers.
good,"My experience as a UPS driver helper was very positive. It helped me to secure a job later at the UPS hub which I stayed for 5 years. The job was very demanding that I constantly be on the move and hustle which at first was tough but got used to it. Working with the driver as a team, you help plow through the stash of boxes that come with the holiday seasons. As this was a seasonal job, it was only temporary, but it helped me so much in terms of getting ready for employment at UPS."
good,Everyday is something new and sometimes the bosses don't care about their people
good,"A typical day was very interesting. I learned that most people do  a great deal of online shopping. I did not have any interaction with management, just called in each morning to see if I was needed for work, where and what time to meet the driver. The drivers that I worked with were very respectful and helpful. The hardest part of the job hard to see addresses but the most enjoyable thing was meeting the customers and seeing the smiles on their faces and lets not forget the daily exercise was great!!!"
good,"Manage, plan, organize, and direct all employees assigned to them"
good,This is a fast paced environment. The work is hardly ever done. Must have a sense of urgency to be successful here. Overall no complaints.
good,"At UPS the most important thing to them is improvement. When you first start they will tell you to be at 300 PPH. Once they see you can accomplish that they will begin to put you on higher flow belts and expect higher PPH. If you do not meet these expectations it is assumed that you are not working hard enough. It is the job of the Supervisor to push standards and get you to improve. You must have a strong mental will and be able to tell yourself that you are working as hard as you can. Because if you tell that to you sup. he/ she will not care and will go back to shouting for improvement the very next day. That being said it is not a production job, you do not have to adhere to any sort of standard to keep your job. If you can deal with the BS and give it your all every day, you can be successful."
good,This is a good place to work during college. Easy work to get you through school.
good,"for as much work as it is, your paycheck doesn't justify it.  so i wouldn't recommend it"
good,Good company to work for with great people. Team environment.
good,"busy, physical, and fun. Great flexibility for students in school"
good,"Short nights with fast pace environment."
good,Though the days were exhausting the feeling of overcoming a seemingly impossible task was empowering. If you don't believe in yourself everyday you go to work you will lose to the boxes.
good,Worked as a unloader. Was a fast paced warehouse to work at and a good part time job.
good,loading and unloading boxes. didnt learn one thing but pick up and putting down boxes.
good,UPS was a good place to work. Had good pay and benefits but Management in my building was not well put together. I eventually was unsatisfied with the environment so I left.
good,Hard long days. Can be hot during the summers. Good hours and good health insurance.
good,messed up coworkers. no team helpers. they treat us seasonal workers very bad. had no respect for us. At one point they were pay us an extra 75 a week if we came to work the days we sere suppose to come in. the got jeluos  and demanded more pay for them. some of these guys were making 3000 a week . they would take there time making deliveries . they knew how to mess with the system. i would always see them pulled over sleeping on the side of the road . they were upset cause we was taking there over time lol crazy greedy
good,"Management is constantly interacting will you weather it be about picking quotas up, performance reviews, sometimes they even step in and help when you're tired! Overrall a good job with flexible hours that can help you out with school."
good,"Working for UPS as a company included fantastic benefits and some fantastic people.  If you are going to work for UPS, work for BROWN, not the subsidiary companies.  There are limited opportunities for advancement in some of these accounts.  You are at the mercy of the 3rd-party service vendor and trying to please everyone.  We had so much employee turnover, it was a nightmare."
good,"I didn't work here long so I don't know about the management. I worked with the drivers around the holidays delivering packages. So, I guess the drivers were my co-workers. A lot of them were good to work with but there was one or two that I didn't care to work with. The hardest part was the lifting the heavy packages, but, the enjoyable part was the drive from house to house."
good,standing for long periods of time co workers were were good the hardest part was having to make you quota
good,"A typical day at work will provide a diverse number of challenges which would include new employee orientations, annual training for current employees, safety training, injured employee retraining, and employee counseling. Through it all I have learned to manage employees with different personalities and backgrounds. Also, training employees that learn at different levels and methods.  Helping technology challenged employees to adopt to on-line training and working with the computers when the training is time sensitive."
good,working at ups can be very demanding keeping up with the progess of packages at a pace of over 200 per hour and trying to work in hot or cold weather conditions
good,My best work experience since I started in the working field.
good,"An average day required being early ready for your manager to direct you to your route and off you go to deliver your packages."
good,A regular day at work consist of making sure we work at a resonable speed to complete our tast for that day. Lifting packages and making sure we keep our work station clean.
good,Working for UPS was fun and I got to meet many wonderful people everyday. The work was hard but the pay and benefits were well worth it. I would still be there if the company's views would not have shifted so much.
good,"daily had to open store and run until noon. managed payroll, supplies, personnel, and customer service. I learned a lot about customer service as well as the complicated side of being a business owner. my employees were of the highest calibure and were dependable as well as friends. the hardest part of the job was the stress caused by a bad economy."
good,Great company to work for if you are looking for a career.  The pay is low for the part-time employees.
good,The most challenging things about the job is sorting and lifting the box from 1-70 pounds.
good,The job itself is ok but lack the hours does not help the employee at all.
good,It was where I got my first management experience. I worked part time for 5 years before I left for FedEx Ground.
good,"Decent place to work because of the opportunity to advance, but the first year is rough. We typically unload incoming trucks/ trailers, and loan containers for shipment. Hazardous weather conditions make it difficult when loading the plane, but otherwise the work is not too bad. Wish the starting pay was alot better but if you can hang in there to have the opportunity to drive, it is worth the struggle."
good,Great for secondary part time work. Not good as a solitary income
good,working at ups as a seasonal drivers helper was pretty intense. I enjoyed working with my co workers. The drivers where nice when it came to helping me unload a heavy package. It is an intense work out job to me.
good,"I was a driver helper, had to run packages from the truck to the door. Also, had to load the truck at times. Was just hired for the holidays and never given the chance to get hired long term."
good,UPS is full of part time management employees and trying to land a full time spot is like winning the lottery. I work with people who have been waiting for over 10 years for a full time position.
good,"Setting up across shipment for drivers, answering the phone. faxing, slotting pars in time order.  Great bunch of co-workers ."
good,Productive company where it pertains to Package Shipping.
good,"I refuse to discuss my current place of work. If such a discussion is necessary to use the services provided through Indeed.com, I am formally requesting written notification of said terms of agreement."
good,"Tough job, the hours are not favorable. There are not any breaks while at work. Managers are not very people oriented."
good,A great to work and learning new jobs. The people are great to work with
good,"Decent environment. Need to update policies, being a 100+ year-old company."
good,"At UPS we typically processed some five to eight thousand  packages per shift, coming from in the United States and headed to Toronto. Management was good, often providing ""pizza"" days as recognition for hard work and dedication. Overall, I must say that I had the chance to work along side some true characters."
good,A company that offers great benefits and is union protected
good,Didn't learn much since only being there for a few short weeks and was also an on-call position so didn't get that much hours in.
good,picked packed items until line duty was done normally fast but the hours wasnt that great
good,"•a typical day at work - 7am to 6pm"
good,"3 stars"
good,Fun Activity with team & also the kind of people are good. to elaborate the work is good n the suppert staff are also good..
good,I love the people I work with and the customers are great. I have learned a lot since I have started working there and it is very rewarding.
good,management was not that great employees were very helpful and job was fair
good,During peck season it is  a very busy place to work. I have learned about different medication some of them I have been given at my doctor's office. The hardest part about working at Ups is working in the cooler.
good,"cold in the winter, hot in the summer, laid back enviornment"
good,"Freindly environment to work at.No work pressure. Each individula had his job profile assigned which we had to complete accordingly. No superior staff treament to any one.Beig an mnc all were respected and treated equally.We never had any fear to report any issues to our seniors both official or perosnal in case needed any help. We always got good postive response from our management when we needed help. "
good,work hours are horrible as an unloader or working in the hubs. the pay was bad as well but the benefits were the best part of this job.
good,"Sort and stack packages in trailer, wash and fuel trucks. exhausting work. High turnover of employees because heavy work low pay."
good,If you are young and energetic this is the company to work for one to advance in management or in hourly positions
good,"fast pace enviroment, heavy lefting, diverse culture but hard labour with low pay and not that great of pay."
good,This was first line management. You were mentoring and monitoring employees daily. You truely were the impact playing on moving the numbers.
good,"	Total responsibility US International Sales, Enterprise Accounts within the Retail, Industrial Automotive and Government Sectors "
good,"i only had a seasonal job as a driver's helper so i can't say all that much. but it was a very active and demanding job, so to those who prefer desk jobs, this is clearly not for you. "
good,I was only there for Christmas rush.  I wasn't there long enough to form an opinion.
good,This was a part-time temporary job and I was given much latitude about dealing with customers as my supervisor stated that I was trustworthy and able to handle things on my own.
good,this job is perfect for any student because most of the day you are doing nothing all day. I would be bored a lot thru out the day just waiting for a customer to walk in so in the mean time that time is perfect to do any homework. Thru out the holidays that's a different story it can get very busy so you must be on your toes. Manager is a very nice lady who loves the company and shows it by making sure its always clean and the customer leaves happy
good,"It's not easy to work there. In hindsight, I should've tried to pass the exam to become a sorter there."
good,"Let me start out by saying UPS is a giant company with hundreds of thousands of employees, which means that I am not the voice of everyone there.  Yet I would have to say that my experience there has been filled with mainly melancholy experiences mixed with a few ups and downs.  Management is idiotic, to say the least, the union is slipping, to say the least, and the work never slows.  Benefits are amazing, my co-workers are fun to work with which is rare seeing as the turnover rate for employees there is normally about a week, and my personal manager has become a friend as well as a boss.  Hard work, not very many hours, but a fun atmosphere (at least in my area)."
good,"Worked from 6:30am-9:30pm daily"
good,"If your the type of worker that can start from the absolute bottom and work your way up, this is the company for you."
good,"the best benefit, great experience opportunity, many shifts and the best place for those new to the workforce such as high school seniors or college freshmen."
good,"it is a part-time job, for a typical day at work"
good,I really enjoyed my time as a supervisor in college and wished that I would have stayed with them.  The shifts are very hetic but it's a fast paced in the elements job that involves trouble shooting problems to make it all work.  If you like fast paced jobs this is the place for you.
good,"Go to work"
good,Not a high paying job and not much responsibility. Very boring at times. Spent a lot of time detailing trucks because of the boredom.
good,"Great atmosphere, fresh air. Good managment with alot of employee particapation and overall good work place"
good,It was a good place to work. Very safety oriented. Good place to work and advance in.
good,"This job was not very difficult at all if you were lucky enough to work with an driver that actually worked as well which i was, but my primary driver didnt do much which left me taking most of the load which was draining."
good,"typical workday includes..."
good,"A typical day at UPS was slight hectic. I learned how to operate a conveyor belt and use machinery to load and unload United Parcel Service trucks, it was very difficult as me being a female to handle heavy equipment. My co workers were mostly men who had no problem helping me out with any problems I had with machinery, the hardest part was having to stay busy and try to do as much before it was closing time. The enjoyable part was leaving knowing I am doing my best even if it wasn't good enough."
good,"Come in get your tools and go to your station. This was not a position that you could take anything from. This was an easy job all the way around, from the workers to management. My co-workers were a great bunch of people to work with. The job wasn't that hard. It was like getting paid for your time beecause the work was not hard at all"
good,Unload a bunch of boxes onto a conveyor belt.  The workload was demanding and the pay is mediocre.  Benefits include good healthcare on the flipside.

good,"I really enjoy working at The UPS Store, it gives me the opportunity to work with a lot of small business in the area. Helping them with their small printing needs"
good,Overall my time there was good pay could have been better and the slow season sucks but overall good.
good,"I enjoy the work that I do, and I've learned so much about being a leader.  This is the toughest job I've ever had and I like that about it.  I enjoy my co-workers and there is a real bond between us."
good,"It was a nice and fun experience. The role of the UPS temporary driver helper is to assist the UPS driver on the delivery route. The driver helper works in conjunction with the driver to expedite delivery of the packages from the truck to the customer. The packages are organized for delivery within the vehicle and the driver helper quickly walks the package to the customers door. While the helper is delivering the package, the driver is readying the next package for delivery upon the helpers return to the vehicle. Temporary driver helpers are not allowed to drive the vehicle."
good,"Usually come in load trailers for 3.5/4 hours then go home. Really didn't learn anything new, never met management co workers were cool some would bring in lunch for every one, benifits was the best thing about the job"

good,every day i would be getting home late and sleeping in late till i had to work i honstly felt that it was hurting my health and gave stress whenthe job should have been a better experience.
good,"You can work at UPS (non-management)  the rest of your life if you choose. You will have to make some concessions in order to do so. At UPS you are protected by a Union, this enables under performers to keep their job. If an issue arrises, even with everyday operations it will take a ridiculous amount of time to resolve. You are payed for your back, not your brain, so understand what your getting into. It is a great opportunity for some, and will provide a decent living, comparatively speaking to most other employers in their industry."
good,Lifting and moving packages you need leadership to move on which everyone should have
good,Good benefits. Not many hours. Hard work. Early mornings. Loading packages onto the trucks. Lots of packages.
good,"A typical work day would include me fingerprinting people, running copies and faxes, processing packages, then at the end of the day vacuuming and taking out the trash.  Through this job I learned how to work with people through stressful situations, and how to run a UPS.  Management was nice, the owner would buy us lunch whenever we worked with him, he was playful but serious for the most part.  My co-workers were nice.  I only worked extensively with two, one was the bosses go-to person, the other I was extremely close with.  The hardest part of the job would be working from open to close which is 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. with a little break for lunch.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the benefit of free lunch, and working with my employees because it felt like family."
good,Management and drivers are not to keen on employing female helpers
good,"Productive Job and can be funplace to work, really busy within the seasonal period."
good,"The work was very hard and UPS does not pay well at all.  Theu start off at 8.50 per hour and you only work 3 1/2 per night, definitley a part time job.  There is room for advancement however there is very little room for full time so unless you have been there for 20 years you not ever get full time.  The money will get better if you can manage to stick it out for 5 or more years, and the benifitsa are great."
good,"Fueled trucks that were dropped off from returning drivers "
good,"Company is good though continue night shift is an issue."
good,"unloaded  trucks, sort packages, and load vans. Worked in various departments. Also assisted in delivering on the local routes."
good,"No slackers need apply. Be courteous, precise, timely and efficient."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,great company but for the amount of work and what is expected of you is not good for the pay
good,this job is very hard and fast pace and it pushes the employee to their limits.
good,"I learned to take out high values such as carriers from phone company like t-mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, And Mac. Also computers, ipads and such."
good,The work was mostly loading trailers to bring packages to other states at night.I was taught the proper way to load packages safely.
good,Work was decent but the pay was too little for the work being done.
good,Full time work with big workload and basic pay. Worked graveyard
good,UPS is an excellent company to work for. Management is understand and my co workers are caring.
good,"Working as a package handler at UPS was an exciting time for me seeing that this was my first ever job. All I did while at UPS was load packages onto trucks that were delivered to their respected destinations. My supervisor was awesome and was never in a bad mood. He would always try to make jokes through the working hours so we can have a bit of fun at work seeing that the job we did was physically demanding. It was nice working with my co-workers because I knew most of them through my high school, so we were all familiar with each other on the first day of the job. I'd say the only hard part of the job was loading heavy boxes onto the trucks 3 hours straight. But the most enjoyable part of the job was that we were all friends and we never had a bad day at work."
good,This job was fast paced with short breaks. I had no problem working here but I know a lot of people who couldn't handle the work.
good,The stores are franchises so the pay wasn't that good. No room for advancement
good,"there is a lot of bad drama along with horrid management. i had been there for almost 6 years and i have had better management there. now they have a poor center manager there and he is nothing but a (sorry but it's true) rat/mole. this guy has been to 6 other centers and destroyed all of them within 6 months. in his power he gets rid of the hard working people and keeps the slackers, lets the building go down in flames so to say."
good,"It was okay, but needs more improvement. Some supervisors need to learn more about fairness and hard work."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in and setting up your station shipping products that were ground shipping, 2nd day air, and ups express. What i learned is being a temp in a warehouse isn't the best job sometimes you get put on the grunt work. Didn't know management never spoke to me. My coworkers Some were awesome, and some not so awesome. But its expected in a workplace environment. The hardest part of the job was for awhile having to do most of the big shipments myself but i trained others on doing big shipments so we eventually worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
good,"A typical day at work was to clock in set up your station and start working. Then shortly go to ECM meetings to discuss the daily events, and then go do stretches. So no one gets hurt through out the day. What i learned was Shipping, and Picking which are basically to positions that are in most warehouses so it was useful. I cannot really say much about management within being there for 7 months i'd never spoken to them. My coworkers most were quite nice. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to rush and meet a deadline of getting the products on the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding friends at work, and of course being able to go home."
good,start slow pick up management was ok co-worker was fun 7 laid back when work was flowing in & getting done it made the night go by quicker

I enjoyed seeing the customers smile"
good,Had to unload packages from trucks onto a conveyer belt as well as load tugs from left to right with no gaps.
good,My typical day at work here was operating the forklift. I learned forklift operations while working here. The hardest part of the job was learning routes. The most enjoyable part was getting along with the people I worked with.
good,this is an easy to get job but the hrs and payrate are to many and too low. this job is very time consuming. they required you to do overtime not optional. you work in the busy months such as november through january. the labor was the hardest part of the job. if you are not the type to do walking and heavy lifting for extended hours in any weather this jb is not for you.

good,"loading and unloading cars, trailers, hot, physically demanding"
good,"Good company, something new every day. good people and management. I unload scan sort packages"
good,Ups has a lot of opportunity for advancement due to it large size and many divisions.

good,"I loved my time at UPS.  It was a night shift position, so it was not practical.  "
good,"Third shift is tough, especially while attending college. Although this was not the easiest job, I met a lot of great people there, and my supervisors were flexible with my schedule. "
good,I love the fact that's UPS doesn't hold you back...they would rather see you advance within the company with is great.

good,"Working the holiday rush at UPS"
good,UPS was simple i scanned boxes an stacked them i didnt work with anyone i did the trucks myself an as far as the other loaders we were so tried nobody really talked much during breaks. The hardest part was the holiday season endless boxes coming in at rapid speeds absolutely crazy.

good,"I would just show up for work at 5:00pm and find out what station I would be working that day. I would usually be loading the trucks and stacking packages."

Most of my co-workers are men so i've become more comfortable on how to get the respect from them through the course of the years. The hardest part of my job is having a crunch time to get things out by a certain time. Learning to prioritize my work load.

good,"During my short tenure at UPS I enjoyed working part-time sorting by zip codes and loading trailers. This job reminded me of playing with blocks. It was a good memory of childhood times. Therefore, even though it was a job that required physical endurance it was enjoyable."
good,"Within the past years, the job has been getting harder and harder and the company has been pushing more and more work on their employees. Granted they can't force you to overexert yourself, but when they put all this work in front of you, it's human nature to want to finish your work so you innately work harder or consciously work slower. Either way it's frustrating at times. But if you can tough it out and become a driver or any other senior position the job pays very well and has great benefits. Not to mention union protection and you should be set for life. So if you can deal with physical labor, can put up with the workload and deal with sometimes absurd workloads, AND deal with some management who comes around at times to treat you like dirt (I mean seriously, some are cool and appreciate your hard work and some just treat you like an idiot)... yeah I guess some of this goes for any job but you should be ok if you can do those things."

good,"A typical day at work would involve an extreme effort to motivate my employees enough to work at a extremely productive pace. Everyday I learn how to better my people skills with employees in my work area. My co-workers respect me as I respect them and that is what keeps us moving throughout the day. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with different scenarios everyday such as not having enough staffing in my area or dealing with troubled employees who do not work to their full extent.

good,"Typical day at work was to input information of workers time cards. I learned how to key enter from 8,000 key stokes per hour to 12,000 per hour which was needed for busy company.

good,"a typical day at work would be fast paste and hard work,but great people to work around and good pay"
good,a typical day at ups is a fun hard working day. We learn new sort changes every week. we have to stay alert with our job at hand. Management only bothers you if ur not doing what your suppose to do but i have no problem with them. The hardest part of the day is sorting with lack of help. The enjoyable part is lauging with co/workers
good,"I worked there for the Christmas season, it was fun, helped deliver packages to peoples doors"
good,fast paced work
good,when I start work I have reports that need to be run so I can carry out the tasks that need doing. set up scanners to scan packages that return to the depot. deal with the packages and drivers that return to the depot. fix all errors. finish off the night with ore reports.

good,Good place to work except for the pay
good,UPS was only seasonal but my experience there was decent. Typical warehouse jobs. You load and unload trucks.

good,Rewarding job with helpful coworkers. I learned a lot about UPS software and just how many people worldwide the company serves.

good,package handler. loaded box trucks in timely and orderly fashion. overnight work hours.
good,"On a typical day at work, you come in and get your area arranged and started for shift. I've learned there's ways to make a hard job easier and much fun. The management is very stricted. All the co-works are easy going and nice. The hardest part of the job is lifting irregular 80lb. packages. The most enjoyable part is the conversations, jokes, snacks, and BBQ's."
good,My van dock loading for UPS is a very hard job. Being rushed and doing a 8 hour job in 4 in a half hours is crazy but that is what they want us to do. Not only that but to have a small amount of 50 to 70 lbs and over weights waiting at the end of my shift is more crazy. It is a good work out though.
good,"I open the store and wait for customers to come in. I assist them with whatever service they need help with, which is mainly shipping, copying, or faxing. The hardest part of my job is handling so many tasks at once. Management doesn't really assist us with any help."
good,Holiday job with UPS gave me the opportunity to learn the ends and outs about how packaging companies are ran.
good,"To make it through a career at UPS you must have or be able to grow very thick skin.It is a job that will make you harder than you have ever been.

You will become numb to the comments and harrassment. These skills will stay with you for the rest of your life."
good,"Did very well here, the last month i worked there they gave me employee of the month, so they do recognize there hard workers. Downside is you don't get paid much at all, and the three hour days. Just doesnt cut it. Learned how different belts work in a warehouse, different shipping processes.

Shortly after being hired as a inspector (part-time), without benefits, I was promoted to Area Supervisor, also (part-time), but with benefits. Today, my record for Mulitple -Sorting for the European theatre still exist...The concern was how long could I be sustained to support a family on my income by merely being part-time. Both staff and upper management recieved from me a quality of execution that I and they were proud of and perhaps after 2-3 years, I could have made it! The work was hard, but good!"

good,A typical day at work consist of me rating and preparing freight bills to send out to UPS Freight customers for payment. What I've learned about this job is how to calculate the cost for the freight industry and how to work in an administrative. Management and the coworkers are great which also made the job easy going. I would say the hardest part of the job would be learning all the different customers pricing
good,une journée agréable de travail est celle qui nous a permis de faire en sorte que la compagnie continue une bonne progression et demeure compétitive.
good,"Relatively simple, doesn't require much thought but there are many details to know about. Perfect job for in between career changes."
good,A great company with great benefits. However becoming a member of management discourages you from wanting to advance within the company due to politics and everything you have to go through just to move one foot in front of the other.
good,"I had a cool manager who one day just came out and told me that I was doing a good job, which made me feel good about the work i was doing and made me continue."
good,It was basically an easy job no problems. management wasn't around just the driver and myself.
good,"Typical day at work? 15 hrs a day. What I learned? I learned how to be cold and fight the union on a daily basis. I learned how to push employees to breaking points. Management? Management is shoot first ask questions later, even with eachother. Co-workers? They will stab you in the back to get ahead in the very few jobs of upper management that we had. Hardest part of the job? That would be not seeing your family or kids grow. Most enjoyable part of the job? The pay at my rank was amazing, but you can't buy back years of your kids growing up while you sleep every chance you get."
good,"First of all I have to admit that the pay and benefits at UPS were very nice, the benefits package was actually exceptional. This was of course due in no small part to the efforts of the Teamster members. The work itself was rather rewarding, everyone worked hard, and you knew you had put in a full days work when you left. With that being said I can say that I enjoyed very little of my time with UPS, nor did many of my co-workers. This was due largely to the attitude of the company, or at least much of the management teams I dealt with. Their approach seemed to be one of constantly tearing down their employees. Always looking for and punishing what was wrong and giving only lip service, if that, to what the employees do well. This created a very negative atmosphere in the facility in which I worked, something which from what I understand is quite common company wide. Don't misunderstand me, I'm all for constructive criticism and want to improve at whatever it is I am doing. But there is a difference between a philosophy of we can do better and one where your best is never good enough."
good,I didn't mind the work I did stay busy for about 8 months but then when things started slowing down I wasn't getting much work and eventually my hours were cut drastically!
good,"Short Hours, But Very Busy. I Learned Not To Slow Down On Very Busy Days Or You Get All Your Packages Behind. The Hardest Part Of The Job Was When You Got Your Packages Stacked Out And Couldn't Keep Up."
good,hard work at ups. only got like four and half maybe five hours a nite. long wait to become driver.
good,delivered packages at a fast pace during the busy holiday season until the truck was empty.
good,a typical day would be fast paced but also it would be unstable with all of the cluttering of packages in the trailer and old equipment it is a unsafe work enviroment.
good,learned how to deliver safley packages to all residents and businesses on route in good and bad weather
good,"I either open or close the store. I work with 3 great people. One being the owner. The Owner Mano is great. But she can't afford to give me more hours or pay. A typical day is running reports and checking the status on the Mailbox Customers, checking on Claims. Checking the inventory, putting out more inventory, light house keeping. This is all done in between customers. My main job is to take care of the customer. I either help them ship UPS or USPS. Because we also do mail here. I can price out and give out quotes to our customers. I run reports for the UPS Driver when he picks up our packages. At the end of the day, I turn off our copy machine, fax machine, etc I then run the end of the day reports and go home. That is a typical day at the UPS Store."
good,Help the driver with door to door deliveries of packages and parcel. It was fun working out side and instead of in a building.
good,Flexible hours and job advancement where available. I loved the people I worked with.
good,A typical day at work was working a trailer full of mis-stacked boxes.
good,On a day to day basis we process over 100k packages insuring that they reach their destinations on time. I've learned how to deal with people in a fast paced environment by using some critical problem solving skills in a team environment. I enjoy setting goals for my team and watching them work very hard to achieve them.
good,"I learned about cross docking operations and how to consolidate various inbound and outbound shipments. Management was suspect at best. They didnt adhere to their stated company values which is why my review of the company is not the most positive. The job itself, however, was quite fun and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is that an employee was subject to the various weather conditions. This, of course, was due to it being an open dock facility."
good,ups was my first real job it helped me grow up it helped me to work for what i wanted
good,"I learned more about computers as far as data entry. Management employees we're Great! I learned how to stay focused and calm in a fast paced and stressful eniviorment, as well as getting my work done in a fast timely maner. Their was nothing really to hard for me in the area I worked in. The most enjoyable part of the day was when I got everything wrap up and all my work was done early."
good,"you start very early in the a.m. ,you are lifting boxes for about 3 1/2 hours.some managers are very good some are very nasty.co-workers are fun to be around."
good,- What I expected as far as work
good,"Very fast pace on feet all day . Learned to move boxes to the right location . Manegement is ok not the best , co-workers are great to be around .The work was the hardest part ."

good,"A typical day at work, packaging, filinf, faxing, copying, western union transactions, lifting light to heavy boxes, customer service, and cashier. The hardest part of my job is, fiding things to do when the store is slow and I already cleaned, re-loaded the copiers, and wash the windows. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new and friendly people."
good,i learned alot about multi-tasking. Every department has its level of difficulty.
good,Loading truck trailers. Learn to scan packages and to build a safe and sufficient wall. The management staff is always there working along side of you. Most difficult part of the job is deciphering package weight. Most enjoyable part is achieving the daily goal
good,love going to work here for ups but it just didn't pay enough an it takes to long to go full time
good,"Easy schedule, easy work environment. I worked on a computer monitoring equipment for possible failure and reviewing the work of employees out on the floor."

good,Load/Unload freight trucks full of cargo. Learned Hazardous Material safety handling.
good,"Really like the company, but need chance for growth. Been with the company going on 6yrs. At this time, I need more pay and roome for growth."
good,"If you are looking to work hard, this would be the job for you."
good,your just a number to them .. to many managers .. pay is good and good bennys .. long days
good,"This job was NOT with UPS, it was with The UPS Store, an independently owned and operated franchise retail store. An average day was surveying the store to see what is in process and making sure everything is being completed. If not, then investigate why and resolve the issue. Also, checking the cash registers to make sure there is sufficient change, checking the postage meter to make sure there are funds, check the Mailbox Manager to make sure there aren't any pending notices or expired boxes. If necessary, I would have someone do an inventory of boxes, supplies or retail items and if needed, place an order. I would check email for requests, issues, notice, etc. I would handle any claims if needed. I would do payroll bi-weekly and accounts receivables billing monthly. Also, I paid sales tax processed commissions and filed the Royalty report monthly."
good,Fast pace and steady. The hardest part about this job was the weather. How every it felt outside was multipied by 2. The most enjoyable part was it was a great workout and part-time.
good,"In a typical workday I would load anywhere from 1,000-3,000 packages ranging anywhere from 1lb->100lbs into a 53' trailer. In my time at UPS I learned how to deal with difficult management that pushed the limits of how much extra work they would ask of you, and difficult co-workers who the more time they had at the company seemed to do the least amount of work."
good,"I would come into work 4 in the morning ready to start my day. my supervisor would tell me whether I was on the pre-loading team or unloading team; Usually I was on the pre-loading team. I would have to sort packages as they're coming off the conveyor belt for my two trucks by address and whether they were being shipped by ground or by air. This was my first real job and it only lasted a month so I didn't get a chance to learn as much as I felt I could have. the management team was pretty decent, they could have definitely been more helpful and informative towards their employees. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was waking up every morning and relishing in the feeling of accomplishment in going to work."
good,A typical day at work is working on a deliverable for the phase in the SDLC. Currently I am proof reading my Functional Requirements Document and getting it ready for posting.
good,great place to work great benifits. hard working people. friendly environment.
good,"This is a good company for new workers or people with no obligations ie family, school etc."
good,I work with 8 to 12 employees that require motivation to perform their daily work functions. I enjoy the interaction with employees and I feel joy when an employee advances to another level after my training.
good,"good place to work for awhile. good job hours and pay, usually had overtime. the only bad thing was losing this job because zulily pulled out of the company."
good,"good part time job for people that need those hours to fit around their schedule and especially benefits, other than that and experience, with the economy changing its hard to live on such limited hours"
good,I would come get my scanner go to my assign trailer. Once the packages started coming down I would sort the packages by the region. I had to conatain a speed of 300 packages per hour
good,"hard work, poor management, start at the bottom and work your way up. good benefits, union, job security once in the union."
good,I was morning sorter start time is usually 3:30am end at 8:00am sometimes 8:30. Start out at $9.90 per hour then after 90 days $10.90. With a dollar raise every year after that.
good,"Working for a Fortune 500 company is pretty interesting. Considering our part-time employees earn a raise every six months,UPS is a gd place to gain a foundation in work habits"
good,Pay raise every year other then that it just a lot of hard work for nothing pay
good,"UPS has an excellent compensation/benefits package as well as tuition reimbursement. The hours (5-11) work very well with a full-time school schedule. The environment is very fast-paced, and can be stressful at times. There is a lot to be learned from a management role at UPS which is valuable in any position moving forward. Upper management can be very unrealistic, you manage union employees and the days can be very long when going to school full-time. Upper management is compensated very well also, however the days are extremely long at that level and there can be a lot of travel on short notice."
good,they have a great management team and easy to deal with the superiors.
good,"This company is good to work for if you are just starting out. They provide benefits to part time employees, as well as full time. Advancement opportunities are there, only determined by how hard you want to work for them."
good,UPS is a great place to begin your sales careerl The training is great.
good,Each person is very helpful and understanding if you are limited to their abilities to do the job.
good,its a fast pace work place but over all the work team is very friendly an fun to be around easy to talk to. an conversations are always fun when you need a good laugh. also if someone sees that you need help they dont ask they just do. an the people on the team always inform you to learn something new each day
good,"While the work itself was not to difficult, greater dialogue among some workers as well as with the management could make things smoother and more productive."
good,The job is very hard on your body. I have a lot of aches and pains. I have not worked for ups in 7 years.
good,Good position but management was a little to be desired. Needed everything yesterday because they didn't realize they needed it when they did. Was always plying catch-up. Probably better situation now.
good,"I Probably Would’ve Had A Better Experience If I Hadn’t Been Working Two Jobs So I Wont Blame Them For My Extreme Exhaustion, But The Job Is Labor Intensive During Peak Season And Long. The Most Rewarding Thing Is Getting To Meet ALL Kinds Of Interesting People And Building All Kinds Of Different Relationships, I Would Work Here Again."
good,"Night shift hours are helpful for college students. Has good benefits. Work can be mundane at times, but it is a simple job that pays good, part-time money."
good,UPS is a great company that offers alot of opportunity for advancement if you like to work hard. It is a fortune 500 company with great benefits and positions in every shift.
good,"As long as there is mail , U.P.S will be apart of making sure it gets to where its suppose to go.I have mixed emotions about working there due to the impersonalism of it.You can give it 125% but the vibe there, is you are quickly replaceable."
good,"The Job itself was very tiring. It was straight hours of back breaking labor with little to no breaks. The supervisors were sometimes bothering and annoying. The only breaks we got were only 10 minutes long and some days we wouldn't get any breaks at all. Not much was learned considering there wasn't much taught except for the workplace itself and how to lift the boxes properly. The hardest part of the job was the work itself as some trucks may be filled with light or not as much packages, but sometimes you may get unlucky and get thrown into a large truck full of 70-100 pound boxes with no help. The most enjoyable part was the small break we get since its much more quite than the facility and you can actually relax for only 10 minutes before having to go back to work."
good,The management at UPS can be very rigid. The hours for management can be very fluid and there are no exceptions to putting UPS first if you want a supplemental income as they try to limit your hours to 27.5 a week during non peak season. You can work 5.5 hours one day and 9 the next.
good,"I mean, its a good place if your desperate for work immediately, and its a great place if you want a well-paid part-time job. In-general, its not for the faint of heart. The setting is dingy and disgusting. The people are colorful, in good and bad ways. It is extremely tiring, so you'll lose plenty of weight, but probably not in a healthy way."
good,"So I worked there for little while and, from my experience I was getting better and, better till I figure out I was doing better then most and they started abusing me with making me do some of the hardest posting which is called the 400 with the worst person aka team so I truly say it’s hard but not to bead if they give you a good person to work with"
good,It’s ok if you really only need a part time position. You can’t rely on the hours to support a household (lucky to get 4 hrs a day during regular season) the benefits are great if you can last 9 months before you are eligible for them. Would recommend only for extra income and staying in shape
good,"Management didn’t seem very efficient, sometimes shifts would be changed throughout the week with no heads up, breaks are very short with high demand in labor"
good,Chez ups les locaux on ouvert il y’a moin de 2 ans donc tout est neuf et les lieu sont toujours entretenus les zone de travaille régulièrement nettoyer
good,A very fast pace work environment during the holiday season with delivery trucks being packed with 2x more than normal quantity. Average work day is moderate-fast pace with delivery trucks being able to be loaded easily. Prepare to be sore and tired.
good,Its a very friendly job. You have to communicate with customers in a friendly manner and also lift boxes and crates. Must be fast at what you do as it is a fast pace environment. Must be able to lift heavy boxes and crates.
good,"Overall good place to work if your looking for great benefits. Very physical manual labor job. Must be able to work in a fast paced environment while multitasking. Be able to push, pull up  70 lbs"
good,i really enjoyed working there because everyone is nice and approachable but i dont get enough hours and i would really like a full time job so i can get all of my hours and make more money.
good,I felt confident in my co-workers but felt uncomfortable and unimportant when it came to how I was treated by my superiors. They expect you to give 110% effort yet aren't willing to always do the same for you.
good,"Great place to work, just needs more people to work there and be able to help otherwise responsibilities unfairly shift onto those who otherwise loyal and hardworking."
good,"You have to call in every single day to see if they need you that day, so you can't schedule anything. It could be anything like 8-6 or 11-3, so you can't even have a dinner planned after work. Pay is awesome though."
good,"I worked at UPS for about 6 hours. I went in there expecting to be trained, but after watching a short video about hazardous material, was immediately put to work in a position I did not apply to. The manager was all over the place and very unorganized. There was no safety training or training at all. After about 5 hours of work, the manager gathered all the new employees and told us to go home, I never got a call back. I tried contacting HR and the manager personally but nothing happened."
good,stressig aber gut  bezahlt aber ohne führerschein klasse c nicht weiterempfehlend
good,"It's a great job for a part time job. Especially for a college student or someone just needing a second job to pay bills or whatever, unless you plan on growing with the company."
good,"UPS is a demanding job. You must be able to pick up and carry boxes that range all the way up to 125 lbs (although you will get help). The typical shift is fairly short, around 5-6 hours, outside of peak season. If you value your body and the health of your joints and back, you will not work here for very long."
good,"Driver's Helper is a tough but fun job. It's face paced, and good pay if you are just starting out. You can get benefits even if you aren't part of the union. The driver's are pretty friendly too."
good,"A typical day at work was easy, and pretty boring. Guide the plane in Unload/load it. Walk to the next spot where a plane was coming in and repeat for 6 hours."
good,I love to work and I take any job I have serious. I like to learn new things and improve on my skills. Since I have been working I never had problems with working with others.
good,"1 night we would work for 6 hours another we would work for 1 1/2 hours"
good,Too many managers that do not talk until they find out they told the same person to do multiple things. Some managers are great some are trying to make a name for themselves. Drivers and building workers are there to do there job and go home
good,"This was a part time job when I was a Senior in high school. I learned to properly sort packages, load and unload rucks for delivery.  It helped me to become responsible for my duties and tasks."
good,"It was ok it was needed when I needed money for the holidays , management wasn’t the best not very leader like really didn’t make you wanna work for them"
good,I was at UPS for 2 years the benefits are amazing but the back breaking labor for little to no pay is not worth it at all.if your into that type of work then this would be perfect for you
good,"Good place to work when you get to work. Mostly on call work, Pay is good but only get a 10 min break no matter if it is 4-8 hours. Could be a better place to work if was managed better"
good,Good exercise in a fast paced environment so time flies when you're working. Many opportunitues to move up in the company if you want. I'm mainly there for the benefits and tuition. Supervisors in my area are good. The part I hate is seeing lazy grass people who don't do their share of the work. Lazy bums like that irritate me!
good,"The experience of working at ups was a good one it was very good at times and I am grateful for it, it was very hard at times and alot time consuming it was a good job"
good,"Manager good people, alot of work for little money, peack season working could be working 11 hour days with short breaks. Sometimes not so compassionate when a person is very tired and they say they can't go home and will write you up if you leave."
good,"Expect to work everyday, it is physical. Dress appropriately you are basically outside even if you are a package handler. Be prepared around the holidays to work long hours and almost everyday."
good,"UPS is looking for young people. I feel I was discriminated against because I'm an older person. When I reapplied after doing temporary work over the holidays, I found that for unspecified reasons they decided that I was not eligible for rehire."
good,"The job itself is fun."
good,I say it's okay because yea it's good pay but they don't pay you what you are suppose to be getting sometimes so it is they have to pay back payment to you when it's time to say something to them about the wrong pay.
good,I enjoyed going out on the road with the driver and i got to know alot of great people. Everyone was really nice and Management came and helped out when we got backed up.
good,"Very fast paced, bonus if you are strong physically and mentally. Management can be very lost at times and no one seems to know what is going on. Management would hold us to standards they didn't hold themselves to."
good,"It's an okay job that has good benefits, allows you to have a flexible schedule while going to school and managing your life and anything you have to manage"
good,"overall there were a lot of things that needed to be done in the store each day that keeps you busy, on top of helping incoming customers. Throughout the day you consistently receive drop offs and deliveries."
good,I started out at $8.50 an hour as a package handler. Worked my way up through management and witnessed many others do the same. The job has high demands but is overall reasonable. UPS is a solid company to work for.
good,It's hard work but if you stick with it the benefits are amazing. You only work 5 hours a day so having kids is no problem very flexible. It's a great place to work and safety is the key to success.
good,"You would began the night by finding a laoder, a.k.a. a forklift. Then need to go to the dog house to get a trailer or to be assigned to help a fellow co-worker. If assigned to someone for help. you would either help unload their trailer or hand the bills [paperwork for fright]. If given a trailed you would go to the corresponding door on your bills. Verify the door, the trailer, and the seal on the trailer. Knowing all match then you would proceed to unload the trailer and take any\all fright to their respected doors\ trailers."
good,The new contract they have just isn't that great and they take too long with background checks to get your promotion. Not too well organized of an management
good,UPS is a very demanding job. The work load isn't hard but very physically demanding. Can be useful in creating new skills and prioritizing responsibilities.
good,Union job - great benefits but not everyone is treated equally fair. Can be a hostile work environment and the operation does not always run smoothly due to poor management.
good,Although not the best paid in terms of industry the job is secure as long as you get your job done and respect those around you. The company is very traditional and because of that most of the job rules and policies are a bit outdated and it feels as if you are back in time working there.
good,UPS provided great job security and would have been a good career option because their union provided great benefits. The pay rate was fair but moving up was difficult and not skill based.
good,"its just a physically demanding position with not many hours with a very short break but at the end of the day you'll be alright.  The Managers there are very understanding people, there is a nice welcome feeling to the job too, everyone gets treated the same."
good,"Relaxed but busy, great training provided"
good,If you don’t come to ups prepared then you need to be. It’s hard work it’s labor it’s not just serving food through a window if actually takes time. If you don’t plan on actually working then don’t come here
good,Amazing benefits and awesome union. The company at first was hard once you start training it can be a bit overwhelming. Once you get use to it the easier it gets.
good,"Es ist harte stressige Arbeit, das Gehalt war gut."
good,I worked in the warehouse hub and it was fast paced enviortment that is very physical and sometimes. The earlier in the week the busier it was and as the week ended it became slower. Overall there were some management decisions that left you scratching your head and frustrated but overall it wasn't terrible. the only advancements were either become management or a driver.
good,It's a alright job if want chump change for hard labor. Better to be a driver.Eveybod is cut throat up there and messy.Somtimes it's better to stay to your self.
good,The days went fast and I wish the contract had not ended. They worked well under a fast-paced and stressful jobs. Everyone was kind and considerate and easy to work with.
good,"Very stressful and tenacious. The job was very interesting at first but then a week into the job I got injured from a stupid falling box. And then after that, I wasn't able to perform my duties and now I'm filing for workers' compensation."
good,"I started off working at the UPS Store and it was fine but the customers at the store were always so mean. I got paid pretty good and the owner was really nice and helpful all the time, but there weren't that many people working at the store so I was expected to work over my usual hours even though I couldn't because I'm a full-time student. After I said I was going to have to quit because of scheduling problems, I started getting scheduled alone on Saturdays (one of the busiest days) and after that, I was done with it. As long as you have thick skin and a flexible schedule, then this job is great for you, but it was not the right job for me."
good,Entreprise agreable bonne communication proximite formation
good,"Being a loader at UPS is very physically demanding. Part time shifts are usually 3.5-5 hours. You are constantly moving and lifting. You must be able to work quickly and efficiently or you will be come overwhelmed with packages. It is a warehouse, it is not climate controlled so you must dress accordingly."
good,Will select items for UPS and would stack a pallet organized and nice and would take it to shipping and receiving for them to be loaded in trailers would load them up with forklifts
good,Management is and will always be the problem. Until you can ear the respect of the drivers and then make then stop running the show and stop walking all over you then you can run a successful business.  Good luck
good,The benefits are what kept me at UPS for so long but the pay and lack of promotion to full time is what made me leave. Management was lacking in skill and tact. Once you got used to the job it was pretty easy to do but a lot of repetitive motions.
good,"Hardest part of the job is the physicality of it. Lifting heavy packages and working fast takes its toll sometimes. Management can be very stressful, and sometimes not fun to work with but when it is light and not so busy it is a breeze to work there."
good,I was a driver that never got to drive. I sat dead head hot seet the entire time I was working. Its all about being fast and im not fast. Other than that its great
good,"The hourly work is decent, depending where you are placed. I started on the sort aisle and it was fine, for the most part. When I jumped into management is where I seemed to have made a mistake."
good,"I was a package handler at ups and it was the most stressful job ive had but at the same time it wasn't the same kind of stressfull that say working fast food has , they were very fast and to the point and you had to be quick on youre feet overall it was a great experience but I don't think you get pad enough to make it last a while"
good,It was very unprofessional the are not very organized i was not satified in the oay and they also over work you the pay rate they start you off at. Worst warehouse company ever
good,As a sales rep on the freight side of the business a typical workday was out visiting with clients and understanding their business needs. Everything about the company is driven by the bottom line.
good,"Learn how to put boxes together without making it fall"
good,Great opportunity  to work if you are looking for a  part time job  place to grow and make money. Go to school as well would recommend to anyone looking for a
good,"Very difficult work with little to no help from co workers and supervision. Supervisors were nice, however tough. After I quit they refused to rehire me for no given reason."
good,"It was a temporary helper position, but it didn't give me enough hours to pay the bills.  It was a fun place to work with nice people.  I didn't drive the truck, just helped deliver packages to the doors."
good,"Fast paced environment and you get a dollar raise every year which is a plus "
good,"If you starting your career, it's good to be here. You will get good package."
good,"Great place to work , hot at times but if you wear the right clothes you will be okay. The hours are good and money is good if you can grind it through"
good,"It was a great experience for me, very fast-paced environment but it's learn as you go. Could be very stressful at times, would recommend to friends and family."
good,"The environment is very fast paced, and it teaches you a lot.  You have to get used to the culture, but people that work there are just trying to get paid, and they're pretty friendly.  I had a good time working with the workers at UPS, but it could be better."
good,"great workplace fast paced, staff is friendly, hours are good."
good,UPS is an excellent place to work if you are a college student. The work is very hard but worth it if your in college advancing towards a career. Environment can be overwhelming
good,"Losts of moving but  great employees . Great management , lots of great  Communication with one another . Management team is great and helps alot with co workers"
good,"UPS show me another way of teamwork and completing a goal. UPS also should me once again in life that things often go wrong but you have to find a way to correct,fix, or make up for a misshapen."
good,"Try to move up as soon as you can in any direction "
good,"Expect to work hard in exchange for job security. Pay increases after first year are generally 2.5%-3% regardless of job performance. Stay in favor with your manager or prepare for horrible job assignments. Don't complain or give bad scores on surveys or the ""beatings will continue until moral improves""! H.R. is NOT on your side."
good,the job itself it’s pretty simple and self explanatory but very physical constant heavy lifting a lot of memorizing but other than that the job itself is pretty simple
good,The pay is low for the work and the other employees implement a hazing environment. The benefits are average and the hours are strange. Honestly this is a last resort type of job.
good,Pay could have been better also it seemed tht every time an interview for promotion was offered you were always behind someone that was marked for the job and your interview was just a formality so that they could check the boxes
good,Great company with great benifits. Stressful at times due to lack of communication with employees and supervisors. Often times employee is placed in a non win situation.
good,UPS abuse the management team that is why the hard working great workers do not get into management and they hire worthless people and folks off of the street.
good,I don't mind working at UPS the benefits are good and the hours are pretty lenient. It is a great part time job and they do a good job of recognizing good work ethic. Some things are done inefficiently but that is about it.
good,"Management hired from outside seems to be a issue. Groomed management that started out as a Part Timer load/unloader have a better grasp on what goes on and goals that should be met  while executing the fast pace delivery/pick-up out in public with safety the top priority.Most  Outside management are only focused on ""THEIR"" numbers and throw safety right out the window!!"
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"Work place could be better, safety is a concern and not taken seriously and workers are over worked even with injuries they are forced to work. Workers needed to treated with respect and people with more responsibilities should get more than the average worker."
good,"always busy "
good,"A typical day working at ups is you walk in clock in and you get assigned to a trailer you are expected to unload a short trailer in around 30-45min and a long trailer at 1 hour and 30minutes you are also expected to move 1000 packages an hour. Not much to learn working at ups besides safety tips for lifting, pushing, and pulling also the different types of chemical labels that you must watch for. Overall the workplace is pretty chill all the workers there seem generally cool unless you start to slack off or act careless while unloading or loading a truck. Hardest part of working at ups would have to be unloading trucks that are really messy and filled with heavy packages weighing over 70lbs."
good,"Overall my experience at UPS was an enjoyable one. A typical day at work would consist of moderate to heavy lifting of boxes which weighed between 20-115 pounds. My management was very caring and professional. The hardest part about this job however, was making time for my school as well as being able to work. The most enjoyable part about this job was being in a casual and family like environment even when days were very busy."
good,"Had good benefits for long term full time employees but I was not able to get to that before I found another job.  Hard work makes it seem like it's hard to advance, but you just have to work hard."
good,"Start and end the day with loading boxes into a trailer that is typically 15 degrees hotter than the outside temperature"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, there’s a ton of hours available for extra cash even if you are only part time. Not much room to move up in for higher jobs but as a part time job it’s perfect to work there."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to adjust to the training. I was kindve thrown out into the job. Whenever I needed help understanding the belt I was on I couldn’t find any.
good,"This company has a variety of options, be it part-time or full-time. The benefits are unlike any other and really that's what you should be going for initially, especially since part-time provides full-time benefits. However, like any corporate structure, it's all starting to go downhill. The company is making poor decisions regarding profit models, modern technology, efficiency, stuff that they should hire people for but don't seem to. They overwork drivers, don't buy the supplies needed to do our jobs, and don't follow through on any promises. They foster a toxic relationship between management and the union, and believe me both sides are awful in regards to a proper work environment. "
good,management is pretty cool and you meet a lot of people from different backgrounds. usually just come in 30 minutes before sort start and have a meeting then you go about your daily duties
good,"Depending on the team, your work culture is very different. My team was very friendly and worked like a family but the work life balance was often tipped over. There definitely is room for advancement but it almost depends on your manager."
good,UPS is a good job but it is fast paced and physically demanding. The hours are short but your hourly wage is good for the amount of hours you get during your shift
good,"Fast paced"
good,"I loved the people i worked with, but disliked my supervisor. She was rude, made me do her job, she was nice sometimes, and then other times she was just so up your butt for no reason. Everyone begged me to be a supervisor bc they wanted me to be in control of their door."
good,"I didn’t like the hours I worked at ups it was 5 hours each day nothing more, they don’t want to give you overtime really the pay stops while on lunch."
good,Too many chiefs. Was an ok place to work for. Hours were good but I needed full time work. Plenty of customer service and resolving issues work.  Floor workers & drivers were great to work with. Pay & compensation were good also.
good,Great place to work at. But just hours are very low. You have to work at a steady pace.  Somtimes work get slow and then out of nowhere the line would get packed
good,You're going to hate your first week there. Overnight is under staffed and package are absurdly heavy. This job can be very stressful most of the time.
good,"The work is very simple once you learn how things work.  The benefits offered are excellent for a part time job.  However, hours can be unpredictable, making a work-life balance difficult."
good,"I took the job in the hopes that if I busted my butt I might have the chance to get hired on full time. Well I did my part but UPS didn't do theirs so I was let go,disappointed!"
good,I enjoy doing my job.  Working by my self is very enjoyable. I don't have a supervisor standing over to do your job.  My supervisor do not have to worry about me. When he comes in my job is done and ready to move on to next step.
good,"UPS is a great place to work if you’re in college. You can take advantage of the free college programs they have there. But it’s definitely not something I would recommend for a living wage. It pays ok, but it would be awesome if they offered full time for employees who aren’t there for the college benefits. It would also be great if they gave more than about 15 hours a week."
good,"Fast paced, customer service; safety awareness ; turn over in clerical high, in management and drivers low. On the job training. For all levels. Paid time off not available to part time classified employees until 5 years service."
good,"Its a warehouse job and you have to come to work with it on your mind to have a successful day. I believe that if you can work in the UPS Warehouse, you can work anywhere"
good,"It is a lot of physical labor. It's extremely hot during the summer, and freezing during the winter. You receive benefits after 6 months of working there."
good,"Luckily, I am a recent college graduate, and had this job while I was in school. I worked at the UPS store, and there were no opportunities for advancement or wage increases. I decided that once I graduated, I would leave the company, and find a job elsewhere."
good,"The job is very demanding.  Must be in shape and ready to go. You must perform and meet accurate standards.  Benefits are really good, especially healthcare."
good,"working with friendly staff, who are very helpful. There are opportunities to progress in the sector. A great place to build relationships and work that fits around you."
good,"The work was good if you are willing to do a lot of physical labor. Other than that if its not during peak season, its only maybe 3-4 hours a day and the commute was 102 miles one way it just wasn't worth it."
good,They work you really hard and the union takes away a good size amount of your weekly paycheck till you’ve been there for a year. Friendly people great environment just a lot of boxes
good,"Pay is not sustainable living wage. There's not much else to say other than if we cant get paid enough to maintain our household and bills, then there is no way to work for someone that doesn't pay well."
good,Was on call had to wait everyday by phone. Driver just handed me package one after another. I thought helper meant he would do some delivers too but he made me run  every package while he just sat in truck. Was completely taken advantage of. Forced to sit on a tiny hard seat that was like a plank. Would not recommend unless desperate like I was. I slipped on ice right in front of driver didn't even ask if I was ok. Horrible slave drivers. Drivers made triple the money just to sit in truck. Real good deal for the driver but bum deal for worker typical corporate operation. Good luck to all that try it.
good,"This establishment is a francise, and private owned. You were offered paid vacation. Also advancement within the store level. Hours were pretty much set."
good,Le point négatif est qu'il n'y a pas de tourne fixe
good,"I assisted my uncle in loading and unloading truck from moving while moving someone from place to place. Swept up, clean up, moved thing to make it look good."
good,It's an easy job depending where they put you . load line is the worst belts overflow with boxes and you have no time to put them in the trucks. Sometimes workers just slack off and you have to pick up their work.
good,I unload trailers all night but am often harrassed but management. The pay and benefits are great and I dont intend to leave but hrs are low and need to find an additional job to fill in the hrs.
good,"It was holiday work moving packages into trucks in the middle of the night. It was everything I expected it to be, people are tired and have to do a lot in the time they have."
good,It’s a good job for a young woman/man who’s looking for a start in life. Great hours to work you have to have a lot of energy to be in this position. Also good paying wage for a young person
good,Make the best of it. It is not the first choice for a job if you're living on your own or have REAL bills. The typical work day was barely 4 hours. This had to be my side job because it just wasn't enough money alone.
good,UPS is a trucking company with an airline. It operates as such. They are mission focused - and not concerned with optimization but rigorous rule-following.
good,"The best part about working at UPS was the fellow employees I worked with. They were easy going and quite flexible with my schedule. The worst part was that there seemed to be a large degree of separation between long-time employees and new recruits like i was. Even though everyone at UPS starts loading trucks and rises through the ranks from there, most of the higher-ups seem to forget what it was like to do the grunt work and lack the empathy they once craved. Also, do not take this job if you have back or joint problems, as the quick pace and heavy lifting is murder on them."
good,"If you are an analyst let's just say you will be bored out of your mind. "
good,great starter job that you can make a full time job. you must be there for several years to have that chance. the job its self is good just up to you if you want to make it  a life time thing
good,"While UPS does offer a variety of positions and advancement, culture that is typically spoken about UPS is not true. There are a lot of fine lines and fine print that are not explained well if at all. Management is treated horribly."
good,"Good first job, paid average for a starter job. The management was mediocre but overall was a good place to start out at. Good benefits after a year of being there."
good,Good company to work for just not enough hours to give and with the salary being low as well as union dues the pay check was very slim. Other than that great workout fast paced enjoyed my time there.
good,"El clima laboral estaba malo, llamatemente porque aparte de eso era un gran puesto de trabajo."
good,A typical day is a stress induced couple hours where you are supposed to make sure you're not falling behind carrying lots of heavy boxes per minute. Not for everyone
good,"Lots of younger guys are very lazy, and they expect a promotion. I noticed that upper management give promotions to people they know and not what skills they bring to the table. This is a downside to the company."
good,"high employee turnover rate.teamsters union dues.personality conflicts,basic box moving army.fast paced unload. 53 foot trailers and a boom that only extends 25 feet into the trailer .lots of micro management and body mechanic training.pay attention and stay healthy, the pay alone and the physical work out alone is worth the position."
good,I learned how to lift boxes right and how to locate A box the to the house to box is post to go to . And mangers there were not fit for there job didn’t even know how to help us
good,This job is hard on the body be prepared to lift over 100lbs and the management meshing up your hrs on your check other than that you got good benefits after a year
good,"Pretty hard work.  From what I've read over the years people wear out their bodies working there.  Drivers have the goal of lasting long enough to get up to highest wage, but I saw people's bodies failing at 30 years old.  The two women managers at this location were excellent."
good,I learned a lot about how the company works and the flow process of the entire operation. I enjoyed meeting all the different people when delivering the packages.
good,"A workday at UPS starts with early morning phone calls, emails and meetings. I've learned how to deal with overseeing +30 workers with different attitudes to come together and have a productive workday. One obstacle I had to deal with was convincing workers who did not want to work because of an area, weather conditions or not liking their partner that this is a job that we signed up for. Everything is not always going to be perfect but if we change our attitudes and just get through today we can try to make tomorrow a better day. I enjoyed seeing workers listen to my advise, change their attitude and  get the job done in timely fashion."
good,"I like this job because it got me out and about. Job was a very demanding, fast paced. This made for a day that seemed to go by faster. I also enjoyed the physical aspect of it."
good,"Made deliveries Monday through Friday.  Delivered anywhere from 80 stops to 120 stops a day. Enjoyed being out of an office and being on my own schedual, as long as the pkgs where delivered on time."
good,"Would not work there, old school narrow minded thinking. It’s not organized well with drivers and the managers are old school and narrow minded and they don’t understand that I don’t need to be clean shaven to do my job. I think that’s stupid."
good,"The job experience was ok, I was working during the holidays. It was early in the morning and the time to come in would change every other day. The time range would change from 3:00a.m. - 4:30a.m. some mornings depending on how many truck there were to unload. I also worked the day shift which was the truck routes after unloading packages and loading the UPS truck the chauffeurs would drive."
good,UPS has seemingly no proper organization as they only seem to care about the quota. Every day we have less and less employees because no one wants to stay however the work load only ever increases thus leaving those of us who work there with an unfairly packed work load. Also we have been waiting over 6 months for the new contract to pass in order to get moved up to 13 an hour however there seems to be no foreseeable end in sight.
good,"No room for advancement. They culture is the same as it has always been, It is very much an old boys club. Favoritism runs ramped. They have the same problems they have had for years. No one seems to be able to correct them."
good,"You arrive to work and immediately begin setting up for the day. Its very fast paced and physical. My sort consisted of lifting large packages usually 70 lbs or more."
good,"I knew what I was doing in regards to the day to day process. I worked with customers daily, Packed packages, sorted mail, assisting customers with claims for damaged or lost packages."
good,"I thought I would retire at UPS and unfortunately that was not in the cards for me "
good,Part time can be brutal. You can go from too few hours a week to way too many without warning.  Only worth it if you intend to pursue full time employment In my opinion.
good,Small business of the owner and one coworker. Interesting work packing and shipping various items which require different approaches. Work days were generally slow with not many customers. Owner would often find odd jobs for me to do when business was slow without extra pay. Had to constantly clean the store due to a sloppy coworker. Often wouldn't be payed consistently on pay day and had to remind the owner that I wasn't paid. Aside from the downsides the two were nice people.
good,I spent five years managing at this company. There were many things i liked and many things i did not. I managed large groups in the outbound which made for an ever exciting experience. You really need to know your stuff to be successful here. There were many instances of abrupt cross training for middle management to the point that my supervisor didn't know how to run his outbound operation and would blame his failures on us (part time supervisors). There are a lot of alpha male personalities. If you make a mistake prepare to be beaten down about it. You need a thick skin to make it here especially if you desire to be promoted.
good,Ups has been a productive experience for me and I know that im a better worker from my time working there. If i have to say something negative its that at my particular ups its highly inefficient.
good,I can get tired at time but I am willing to work my job the way it’s supposed to b worked. And do my needs in order to b successful while doing the job and being there.
good,"Great deal of opportunity to succeed with the company, but disorganization exists in all areas. Training is non-existent. On the job training makes work/life/balance impossible."
good,The typical day can be anywhere between 10-14 hours. I have learned people management as well as operations management. It is a very fast paced environment with little room for error. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done timely because every aspect of the operation is time-sensitive.
good,i only worked part time at ups. i didnt really care for the management there or the other staff. the turn around rate was very high and that should tell you a lot right there.
good,"Not to let a job treat you as a slave, not let the mangers walk over you, did not respect the hardest worker there. That it. Don't work here unless you want to be a driver."
good,"It's very hard work, physically straining. Have been promised a raise for 4 months now; they just can't seem to work out the details with the union. $10.60/hr for about 3 hours a day/ 15 hours a week - even for part time, this is just not enough hours or pay for the work you do."
good,It was fast pace great work out pay was good buy felt like it should've been paid more for the labor it was well relacedd could listen to music so it wasn't all bad
good,"I was happy at first, but I didn't get the $13 an hour. I did the mid-night shift, but it was way worst than the twilight shift. I wanted to know how how I could get if I did double with a $10.35 pay. I was a know way. I gave the company 4 months to see if they keep their words, nothing and they wanted me to walk like a three man unit. NO WAY!"
good,"the people you work with are amazing management is all nice and really gets along with everyone., but for how stressful and taxing this job is on your body its not worth the 10.35 a hour that they're paying. hardest part about the job is being exposed to extreme cold in the winter and high heats in the summer. Remember you're loading in a metal trailer so if you think its hot or cold outside wait til you get in one of those trailers."
good,"Package handling operations consist of multiple points of unloading, sorting and loading of packages."
good,"First week you need to keep in touch by phone with the main ups office staff to set up availability and schedule."
good,"UPS is about as average a job as one can get, although i do wish my blood sugars remained a tad more stable during such. I also wish my supervisors had done a little research because none of them know how to work efficiently with a diabetic, they give me space while my blood runs high, thankfully. they also try to empathize with me and the attempts are kind of offensive to me because they truly don't know how my mind works with this disease i have."
good,"UPS is a terble place to work at I reccomend FED EX before I do UPS, they don't give enough hours, the workers have been expecting a pay raise as well as back pay but neither of those things have happened."
good,"Wasn't with the company long, but the driver's have been with the company for an average of fourteen years.  Appears to have many life long employees."
good,"workers are really polite and very helpful, have to have work done in a timely manner. it is a quick paced environment when means you have to be able to lift up to 50 lbs or more to load the trucks"
good,You get stuck here because of the benefits offered.  Hours are good  but not very flexible.  Management is cut throat.  They could care less about their employees.
good,"Physically demanding. Long hours. Work in  inclement weather almost non stop until your truck is empty except for half hour lunches.   Pack your own lunches, snacks, drinks, use the restroom at businesses that ""may"" allow you to use their facilities.  Most drivers have established routes with regular customers who are generous. By the end of the season you will either feel the most physically fit ever in your life. Or you'll spend the next month recuperating. You get to meet a lot of people, get to know your area geographically very well. I enjoyed it."
good,"Management was poor, the people who worked on the floor doing the manual labor and the supervisors who at times were seen walking around or in the office never saw eye to eye as to how things should have been done. It was mostly a dictatorship, my way or the highway relationship."
good,UPS is great job if you are looking for a stable company that offers great benefits. This job is more suitable for the younger crowd as it is a fast paced environment.
good,"Not much goes on. An average work place. Easy to get acquainted with the skills required, and not a smothering environment. Many possible advancement opportunities."
good,"UPS is a good company to work at if you’re going to school and they are paying for it. Working there as a regular job does not provide you with a steady, liveable wage"
good,"Work 40 hours"
good,"It was my first tine working at UPS, considering I never had a warehouse job.  The hours are fine, and they're flexible with your hours, but what I hated the most was that they work your a**** off, but you get less pay.  They say peak season is the best season, but I'd rather be paid for the hardwork I put into this private company.  Not only that, since they push you to do hard labor, and nitpick the small things, guaranteed they'll let you go if you don't show extreme ""work efforts""."
good,"Fast paced, starts on time, learned proper safety methods, management usually helps out and tries to keep everything in order. The hardest part of the job is usually around the holidays."
good,I would recommend UPS to anyone looking to get a little extra spending money this is not a job to live off of since they don’t have any full time positions for package handlers. The work environment is pretty relaxed but they could use better management.
good,"UPS has opened many doors for me throughout my last 3 year with the company. I started as a package handler and moved up rather quickly. Almost every job there is rather stressful, as it is a fast paced working environment with many things happening at once. However, the coworkers I have had the opportunity to work with are great and make each day enjoyable."
good,"very fast paced stressful environment, temperature's could be from negatives to hot humid days doing heavy jobs with poorly salary. Management was not respected when coworkers would not get along being a team oriented job."
good,you work three to four hours a day/night depending on what happens. Good pay for the hourlys and health insurance isn’t too bad. Everyone gets college tuition so you have no problem going to school.
good,"Gotta be attentive and focus on the boxes and look at the zip codes "
good,"UPS is a great place to work. Though the hours as a part time package handler can be a bit rough it is still rewarding work. The job can at times be stressful, but on either side of you is someone ready to help you if you ask them."
good,"Night shift plus lifting heavy boxes. Also, during the winter time I had to work outdoor lifting boxes for 6 hours and I wasn’t allow to take sick until I finish my first 3 month."
good,everything was fast paced. I worked during the holidays so it was extremely busy which made my day go by fast. I had a great team of individuals working with me
good,"UPS is fast paced and a very physically demanding job.  As a driver and supervisor, it consumed most of my time and I had very little time at home or with my family.  This is not a job for the weak or slow paced."
good,"Cool job to work but hard work they have u do for little pay ,short breaks . U do get benefits after a year of work  but if anything happens family/personal wise u will be fired with a negative re hire for every ups ."
good,"If you are young and dont mind sweating... looking for a parttime gig to make extra $$$ then you should give it a go."
good,Working at UPS was very fast paced and busy. I was package handler and this job was very stressful. I was unloading trucks which had big packages and small packages. I liked the job at first but then I had to resign because the job and school was just too much to handle at one time.
good,not bad work place but needed to pay a little better. work was not demanding but was definitely important task. could of been better employees they were a little unprofessional
good,"I live in Merced, Calf. (the Central Valley in California) but, I Worked in Belmont, Calif. ( the Bay Area-San Fran., Calif). . . I boarded a VIA Bus at 5am, rode 3hrs (unpaid) to Northern Calif. on the coast, Worked around 5-8 hours and rode the (same) VIA Bus another 3hrs back to Merced (arriving back around 12-13 hours later) to Turn and Board another VIA Bus by 5am to do it all over again and though I traveled the Same Route monday thru friday, There was Always something different I learned as the days went by. . . UPS Is a Good Company to Work For."
good,Working here  at UPS is not an east job to do. When i applied i did not think that it would be how it is. We have to load 2-3 trucks a day sometimes more. You have to catch every package that comes down on the belt and you have to make sure that you put them in the right trucks. Our break is also only 10 mins
good,"The average amount of packages that was processed by UPS backs when I was there in 2014 was 24,000 in 4 to 6 hours. The load was 50 pounds more than half the time so it consisted of heavy lifting."
good,"When I worked at the elyria ups, the head of management was very rude and disrespectful. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I was talking to the head manager about going back to college and balancing this job with it and asked if I could change hours and he pretty much told me that college was gonna be a waste of my time and that it’s a useless path to take."
good,"People would quit which made it stressful. The pay wasn't great for the type of work it was. My supervisor was great, though. The people were generally nice. After the holiday peak season, though, hours were less."
good,I worked at Ups in the summer as a summer job. It was a learning experience and I feel as if it benefited me because of the hard work and consistency it taught me.
good,my position was a driver helper and I had take package to build apartment and go company and delivery their package. we had to have the customer sign for their package. we had to carry the package and un load the truck
good,"They just make ups much more complicated than it has to be. The only people who make real money are the driver's. Being a supervisor you not supposed to touch anything. Not one box, or anything for that matter. They still do so because of management doesn't want to pay anyone but driver's and supervisors. The rules in ups might be the most idiotic and irrational rules at a job. There's a lot that ups offers but it's just not worth the little money you get for that hard work."
good,"Holiday helpers for UPS, get to borrow a uniform for the time you work there. You just take packages in a quick and safe manner to the customers door."
good,Enjoyed my job and i was frends with other employees my only problem was management changed often and nobody new what they were doing people who worked hard were punished and those that didn't got promoted all you had to do was talk all day
good,Stressful place to work cause lack of management. Hard to move up seniority. They don’t treat the employees with respect. Gives all the good runs to contract carriers.
good,Très belle entreprise mondialement reconnue pour son image et sa qualité de services.
good,"UPS is a company with great benefits offered to employees.  The work is hard, but with a driven goal you can achieve great goals within the company.  There are many aspects to the company."
good,"I liked working here and enjoyed the employees and managers, but the pay and hours were just not enough. If I was able to work more hours and raise my pay then i would've stayed."
good,"The manager is very friendly and understanding. There was only one other worker who had any life or vigor to them during their shift. The other employees felt either sluggish and bored, or they brandished a fake smile and treated other employees as though they were customers and only talked to them when something was needed. Small talk was nearly impossible yet at the same time constant. Mainly a female staff and the amount of slight distrust amongst the employees was almost visible on a day to day basis. The pay was okay if you worked full-time and werent super stressed on budgeting, but if you are looking to live off this salary you'll have about enough money for gas. The job itself was fine but when theres a slow day theres almost nothing to do and it can certainly bore someone to death if they stayed long enough. On the other hand when it becomes busy it truly is a challenging and fast-paced environment that can be enjoyable to most people. The concepts and tasks required of the staff is nothing ridiculous but there are a lot of technicalities and specific paperwork involved in the shipping industry, which can be very confusing and sometimes detrimental to the company if done incorrectly. Overall it is good as a transitioning job or a side-job for those who enjoy sitting down and standing up a lot."
good,"Antiquated technology. Bastardized application of Agile development. It's worth going there for a couple of years if you're young, but get out early. Not worth staying."
good,Çalışma ortamı düzgün değil ve şartları çok zorluydu.
good,"A typical work day as a UPS package handler involves really fast, high intensity work.  If you are afraid of hard work this is not the place for you..  I was trained well for each position and maintained my job for 13 years"
good,Worked midnight shift. Enter data of trucks entering the northern borders of United States via invoices and manifests. These entries corresponded with US Customs to allow entry of trucks. This shift was phased out.
good,A typical day at UPS consisted of fast pace belt unloading. I learned how to organize the packages on the shelfs in numerical order. The management was great. Hardworking fast paced unloading off of the belt. The hardest part of the job was finding a good sleep schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 10 minute break.
good,This is a great job for kids still in high school or just looking for a part time thing. The pay is what you get but in time you do get raises and benefits.
good,"There were people working in there for years and didn't receive a raise that they deserved. It was very fast paced, but not worth for the amount they were paying us,"
good,"UPS is a solid, stable company in the shipping business.  Management compensation and growth opportunities are limited, hence my interest in a change. Diverse work groups with a priority on safety and production."
good,The job is short but in those few hrs your going to do a ton of work. It’s either extremely hot or cold never really feels comfortable in there but I won’t lwave because of the benefits
good,"working for ups was actually fun even though warehouses are a tough environment, everything was easy to use and the warehouse team was very serious on meeting our daily goals"
good,"It is a fast pace job that keeps me in shape and is the main reason I love it. There are only 10min breaks, which is difficult. Management is very detached from union workers."
good,"The work environment was very fast past, detailed orientated and of high demand. Hours are not ideal, however, there was opportunity for additional hours during peak season."
good,"I work overnight from 12:00am - 7:00am. I am responsible for data entry, data management, and reports management. The workplace is extremely stressful."
good,"This isn't the worst place to work, but its not the best either. You start seasonal until the call you back enough to get on part time-full time. The staff is all cool people. If you don't pick up on the job right away they usually cut your hours and let you go. Most nights you will come home extremely tired just to wake back up and do it again unless you get a set route."
good,"Good benefits but the pay isn't that good considering the amount of work you have to do and hours. Management isn't professional. No good raises. The only advice I can give is to work smart and make wise choices on the trucks you choose to unload, load, or sort."
good,"A typical day at UPS is fast paced. As soon as you walk into the building, you get straight to work. My usual load, being four trucks, had to be fully loaded before 9 am; the end of the early morning shift. 100+ packages can be loaded onto each truck. When you have multiple trucks, packages for each of those trucks will come to you in one or two bins. You have to keep a watchful eye on that and make sure that you don't load packages onto the wrong truck. With that being said it's a physically demanding job that has you on your feet for at least five hours. There's a lot of heavy lifting, pulling and or pushing, in order to have all packages fill the entire space for each truck. The hardest part of the job? Adjusting to early morning hours; 4 am to 9 am. Most enjoyable part? Seeing the friends who helped me get that job."
good,It's a great company to work for if you don't have a family. You'll be able to take care of your family financially but you will miss out on a lot of things in your children's live and also your spouse.
good,The job was intense but very fast paced. The environment was rough really hot in the summer and really cold in the winter. I personally think they would have a higher retention if they offered more full time opportunities.
good,"A typical workday starts around 6:45-7:00 AM and ends around 7:30 P.M. The work phone calls however do not stop until later hours. UPS is a company that is moving at a tremendous pace and presents different challenges every day. It is hard to put into words what I learned at UPS. Throughout my entire career I have managed several employees and had part-time supervisors to over see. Currently I have about 130 employees and 9 part-time supervisors. I have learned how to adjust my staffing needs, prepare for and adjust to volume trends, extensive experience with HR training, hiring, and payroll. The culture at UPS reminds me of collegiate sports. Everyday there is a challenge, everyday you have to put your head down and work as if there is someone out there for is going to take your place. UPS has not set the bar, they are the bar. The standards they hold the company and their employees to is the reason they are a fortune 500 company who has been successful for 111 years. The most enjoyable part of my job is being successful. I have been sent to troubled centers to turn things around and help get their results in line with the goals. I enjoy a challenge and have learned that patience and paying attention to the little things really pays off. When I see the numbers to start to fall in line I feel a sense of accomplishment for being a part of the success. Through my leadership, organization skills and tenacity, I have grown into a successful business person at UPS."
good,A typical day would be me loading hundreds maybe more than a thousand of boxes on a conveyer belt with a team of about 5 others. I learned how to lift objects safely and communicate with others in order to get the job done correctly. The hard part of the job was to not give up because some days it would feel like packages won't stop coming.
good,"The hardest thing about the job is getting up in the morning, since shifts start between 3 and 4 am. Once you get into the union it's almost impossible to fire people, although some of the managers will chew you out. It's easy to hurt yourself if your not careful, lots of heavy lifting of you work in the back of the building unload ing those big semi trailers full of mail. Most jobs involve sorting stuff, sand that's just really boring more than anything else.  They rarely give full time positions, and around Christmas time, although you will get more hours, you will not receive a meal break,so you just bring your food with you and eat whenever you can. Driver positions rarely open up,but if you accrue enough seniority they have to offer you the job eventually. Long wait list though."
good,"The worst part is that there's no climate control, and the building is 80% metal. An 80 degree day means at least 95 degrees inside, and if it's winter, it's about 10 degrees colder inside. It's very quick-paced, there's lots of bending over because everything is designed to be done in a chair but, surprise, no chairs. Very generous pay at $14 an hour."
good,"Customers are rushing in doing drop offs and your helping customers at the same time, while also having customers calling the store about their packages. I did learn a lot though and it really helped me to develop my multitasking skills. The management was okay I felt the owner of the store was being real cheep with supplies because he was opening another store and had to provide for both stores now."
good,"UPS is a decent company to work for specially with the base pay being raised to 13$ a hour, but you work hard with only 10 minute breaks for every 3 and half hours."
good,"A typical day would involve a presort meeting, managing people and processes during a sort, while helping them stay safe and best service the customer. I learned a lot operationally and how to handle and relate to other people and situations. The culture is fast paced. The hardest part of the job was the hours, working in the middle of the night and sometimes 12-14 hour shifts, and the most enjoyable part of the job was successfully getting the sort down and serving the customer well."
good,"The pay was great, but the job was not. It was a fast-paced loading job, where your success depended on what time they decided to bring you in, and if they decided to send you help. They are understaffed and typically never sent help, even when they would promise to do so. Management is constantly yelling like fussy children. They bring people in late and expect them to complete the job with not enough time to do so."
good,Had many good years with the company. Had the opportunity to work with some really great people and also learn a lot of helpful things that can be used for advancement elsewhere.
good,the working hours are not good and its hard working there because you need to fill the big truck with all kind go packaged. lifting heavy packaged and you need  to scan all the packaged  that going to your truck.
good,Personally workin there at UPS package handler was pretty intense because it was just package after package and you have to move fast and be able to put the packages into the right category like a number and a letter so they can be sent to the areas where they need to be deliver. I honestly just love the pay rate because it paid my bills and I ended up with money still in my pocket so that was good. I left because of the area around there was so much complaining and until I got my finger smashed with a 40 pound box and I had to leave because it left it damaged. I worked there in the winter so it gets really cold so you have to layer yourself with good clothing and you also get discounts on shoes and mostly anything so that was good as well because it saved me money for a pair of new shoes to work with.
good,"Fast pace lots of machine,package cars driving around work Monday to Friday normally 10 to 330 subject to change. Ups is a good company bout have alot of bad things happening for instance full-time manager communication skills are poor."
good,If the volume is light they cut to minimal staffing to benefit cost. Little regards to the conditions around them. They make you work in ashes right after a fire. There are days it's hard and days it's cake.
good,Its an okay place to work. Really fasts pace and good place to earn extra money during peak seasons and holidays. Never really felt I had a sercure position due to inside hiring
good,Start time at UPS was from 1am to about 8 am. I learned how to load a truck then manage workers. Management was ok it was so busy time went fast. The hardest part was learning the loads. the  best part was getting the job done
good,"Although some upper management are only goal oriented/focused and neglects the hourly team members, the overall company is great. The camaraderie you can develope with fellow team members makes working there wonderful."
good,His job requires a lot of hard work heavy lifting and a lot of time standing on your feet. It’s a very fast paced job and requires your absolute full attention and energy.
good,"I worked at UPS for 23 years ."
good,They tell you one thing and do another. They say 5 hours a day but we barley was getting 4 hours. They didn't give out any bonuses to people for having perfect attendance like They suppose. Management is not very manageable they play favoritism if you haven't been there for years they just not a good environment.
good,"To be honest there isnt much to describe about the company. Just a place that packages go through a process to get delivered. Simple as that. You have days where the volume of the work is very heavy, and other days it is light."
good,Work was early in the morning and very fast pace. The work culture was very friendly and seemed liked everyone got along for the most part. 100 dollar bonus for coming all days on time each week.
good,"Did spend much time in the office, on the road most of the time .drop load and return for another, or bring one back. never play a game ,work was work,"
good,It's all right great benefits. Great insurance 401k and paid Vacation. It's just the management need to do better than they are doing and treat employees a lil better
good,"-Clock-in, Starting shift.  "
good,Has a great benefits package. Trainers were awesome. Management not that great. Pay right on. No permanent seating so every day was a challenge finding a desk to work at. Extremely upset customers all the time like non stop. Really brings you down. Overall experience was really depressing
good,"I started as an unloader, advanced to a sorter, promoted to a part-time supervisor.  Not the cleanest environment.  Very dusty, physical job requirements."
good,"if you can load 500/hr they should be okay with you, but if you are 350/hr or lower and packages get jammed up the supervisors lose their cool... not too good of a work environment.."
good,"You generally work for 5 hours on average if you're on day sort. It's pretty simple work that requires you to sort out packages to the correct belts unless you're a loader in which case you're stacking boxes into trailers. The supervisors tend to screw you over when it comes to things like paid time off and vacation but luckily the union is there to help you out however annoying the situation may be. One example; there is a system of seniority that applies to how long you've been in the union and recently, management has been giving bonuses to seasonal new hire employees that surpassed the wages of long term employees who had been there for several years."
good,Good company that pays well. No balance of work life and home/family life. Expected to go above and beyond without any compensation. Higher ups in management treat lower managers very poorly which is a viscous cycle.
good,"UPS was the place that I learned what it meant to work with purpose. There is never a shortage of work and sometimes something will turn out very differently than you expect. The work is physical and it is not for the fragile, but if you can pull through it, it will definitely make you stronger. You are adequately compensated for your work and the hours are regular. Things get better with promotion, but the workload and responsibility add up respectively. Overall, if you are able to work hard and not get hurt, it's a pretty good place to be."
good,"You learn how to be a fast thinker your reflexes improve its a team effort .the customers relied on my job being done to perfection ,because if I did not perform my duties the customer could not receive their orders"
good,For a part time job the benefits are great and the pay is fair. The hours are usually steady unless it is November/December. The type of work is very harsh during summer times. Only apply if you think you're physical capable of working in a 100+ degree environment for up to several hours during the summer. Some managers are great but there are numerous supervisors that will be frustrating.
good,"Unless you're in a full-time position such as management or a driver, this is just a supplemental job for benefits, does not provide nearly enough to live off of with an average of 20 hours a week at nearly minimum wage."
good,"Great benefits, but a lot of negativity within the current management team, union, and certain co-workers. I did appreciate the opportunity to have made money and develop a few friendships along the way."
good,"It’s ok but the pay sucks if your not a driver"
good,"This is a good company to start with, but advancement depends on job openings in area.  Not much room for potential raises based on performance while waiting for a position to open up for advance career."
good,From what I can remember of this job from awhile ago I enjoyed working at UPS. it was a part time job and I was given a lot of different responsibilities
good,"Its very fast paced. You gotta keep moving fast and can't slow down until its break time, or time to leave. The pay is very good but you work very very hard for it."
good,"Oversee production and operation of small sort machine (processing ~⅓ of the facilities’ production per day) "
good,"i would sort the mail so that they could be scan as well as dump the mail to be sorted, unload trucks items to be scan,and i also loaded up the UPS  trucks."
good,Late nights with low pay checks. Management can be chill and relaxed sometimes. The hardest part is when we get really busy and everyone starts to freak out. The most enjoyable part is when I get to leave.
good,"I recommend this for people who like to get their hands dirty. this job puts alot of strain on your back and is alot of heavy lifting. if your out of shape, dont apply."
good,It was an okay temporary job. I didn't like the 4:00 am shift because of transportation issues but you did get your work day out of the way and you could do other things. The pay was decent and some of the managers were great some where there to make the work environment hostile.
good,"The environment is very fast paced in management. It is a very result-oriented setting. Working with the union is very tough, and managing labor relations can be very difficult. It is hard to motivate people to perform manual labor on a daily basis. Work-life balance? Forget it. If you want to be successful, expect long hours."
good,"hours are not guaranteed could get sent home everyday, extremely fast paced, not all areas have fans, fans blow out hot air. Laid back environment as long as you get your work done"
good,"I only unloaded the trucks with packages so they can be sorted out in the warehouse. You typically had to be there for 3-4am. You were done when the last trucks were empty. Usually about 8am. It was a neat job, had to be fast and ready to compete."
good,"Has been a good stable company to work for so far. Requires hard work and possibly long hours. Average compensation for the area, benefits could be better such as vacation but about standard for most businesses. Can be both rewarding and very frustrating at times. High level of bureaucracy to navigate at times. Increases in responsibility not commensurate with increases in pay and advancement."
good,"A typical day at work involves monitoring messages received from drivers on the road.  Communicating with On Road Supervisors. "
good,Most of the equipment is old and outdated. A lot lies from management about the work. They try to cut your hours. They promote teamwork and safety. A lot of heavy equipment
good,"If you are physically fit and an organized person, this job can bring you benefits. Stay long enough, and the benefits they provide you do make up for the work you do."
good,"UPS is a huge company that is known worldwide. In order to advance your career, you must put in plenty of hours and effort to get promoted. in this company, you will start all the way from the bottom before you get to a management position, no short cuts."
good,"Ups driver is not a job for a person that wants to be a real part of their families lives. "
good,"I did not interact very much with cooperate, however my immediate supervisor/driver was incredibly kind and helpful, It is a labor intensive job with not many benifits offered, but it worked well in a temporary capacity"
good,"UPS has always been at the forefront of compensation of their employees. That has not changed for full time employees. But UPS is stuck in their old way of thinking. They have management that don't change, don't adapt, and talk at their employees not with them. There is a change happening, a culture shift and UPS is either going to be forced to change, or it will start to decline. I'm not sure which is going to be the case. That is down the road though. UPS is still a great place for college students to work part time and get help with school. After that, if UPS' fast paced, ever changing atmosphere is for you, you can get a very nice compensation package. But the hours will be hard to have a work/life balance."
good,"If you can handle high stress as well as insanely fasted passed work then this company might have a spot for you. Lack of promotion is a real problem I have found, and many people get stuck working part-time for far to long. UPS part-time employees both management and non- management are severally under paid when taking a look at the responsibilities asked of them. With that said it is a great opportunity to learn some very important skill and if you have the chance to go full time are paid well."
good,"The job is physically demanding. They will tell you this in the orientation, believe them. Starting for union employees, the pay is pretty low for the work, but after one year you receive full benefits for free. In the long run, you can't find a better paying part-time job. This takes many years and a tough mental attitude. UPS offers many career opportunities as well for management, they promote from within. All jobs here are tough and should not be taken lightly. The hours and pressure are difficult to work with."
good,Quality Control was a good department to work in. You stayed busy and the work was not too bad. I was able to get a lot of ovetime  and the people I worked with were great people.
good,Coworkers are friendly and lookout for you on the job. Made friends at work for the short time I was there. Supervisors are friendly and approachable. Huge workload but not overwhelming.
good,Working in the warehouse is tough and management can be disorganized much of the time. Be prepared to pick up the slack for workers who don't show up. Many people think that the job is like having a free gym membership in the sense that the work is highly physical and requires a lot of effort.
good,Overall not a bad place to work if you need a job and don't care about the physical labor. Breaks are short but so are the days with being only allowed 5 hour shifts as a hourly employee. Easy to advance but steer clear of management unless that is what you want to pursue.
good,"I usually enjoy labor work and if you enjoy labor work, you'll like this job as well. The culture is great there. I loved working with the people i worked with. It is very fast paced so you need to know where everything goes."
good,"I own the store so it's pretty hard to answer this. The day usually starts out slow but can get busy w/customers very quickly. We try to make it a fun place to work for everyone. My customers love my store! When it gets busy, sometimes it gets stressful. I enjoy helping my customers."
good,"Parcel Pro had more of a family environment; issues were tackled and resolved immediately. Nowadays, management seems robotic with meetings, memos and incapable of recognizing that folks are the bottom make the company run."
good,The climate and culture at UPS are about what you would expect for a large corporation. Don't expect to be more than a small cog in a very big wheel working here. You are no more than a means to an end.
good,"UPS is a really good place to work for many reasons. A lot of people work there for the benefits which include, tuition reimbursement, insurance, and 401k benefits. I think this makes UPS a stable company to work for."
good,Ups was cool place to work. The guys who I worked with were young so we all would joke around and have a good time. It’s a very fast paced job not for slow lazy workers
good,The job isn't difficult so much but the hours aren't the best. The money is great as well as the benefits. However trying to get fulltime work isn't easy unless you go driving which includes 12 hours per day of work and most drivers who retire have massive back or knee problems when they do. It is hard to get rid of terrible employees and because of this management goes after good workers for minor infractions.
good,"I thought ups will be a nice job to work at , The very first 2 months it was all positive everything was working just fine . To the negative came in that’s when everything went left people stater moving slow an they area was getting back up and that was  stressing me out."
good,Start your day with a team meeting and cover information from last night and what to expect for the night. Operating the software at UPS is very stressful as it is hard to understand and also lags out a lot.
good,I would meet up with my driver at a location prepared to work and we would start working are area sometimes it was a break but very fast pace had to eat on the go but you had to do the job
good,"The workplace culture is expected with the status of the company as UPS is well known in the parcel delivery industry. A typical day at work would be to sort anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 packages. which would include unloading and loading trucks."
good,"For a company based on logistics, too many people in charge are scattered brained.  Commitment to seasonal employees is a shady as it gets.  Lucky for me I predicted it and wasn't looking at it from I have to pay bills standpoint and just utilized it to be around family for holidays. They claim sunshine and butterflies, but deliver rain and clouds each day with some random excuse on hours.  (Yes, demand matters, but it's an online shopping world now)  Commit to your helpers."
good,I was a drivers helper and in the best shape of my life due to weight lifting everyday for the past twenty months and wow the pace was fast and left my legs sore. I enjoyed the pace and the workout but certainly not for everyone.
good,"did various jobs day to day, not a lot of home time to relax,management does there with limits. must be open minded to changing environment. work different culture people, very educational, most enjoyable part of the job are payed time off"
good,"I worked for UPS for 20 years as a union employee.  The work at times was grueling and thankless.  After I made full time, the benefits and pay were outstanding.  If one is not inclined to be upwardly mobile and is content to be in the same role indefinitely, then this is the job for you as you are guaranteed a yearly raise with job security. If one is upwardly mobile, like myself, it is not for you unless you get promoted fairly soon after getting hired.  I say that because one begins as a part time supervisor, so if you have been employed a number of years and are close to getting full time, then being promoted to part time supervisor is a significant cut in pay and a significant increase of job responsibility.  Those two are not usually a good combination."
good,"Everyone starts Part Time, you must work your way to Full Time. It is not uncommon to work at UPS for 7 to 9 years before becoming Full Time. Many people stay because of the great benefits provided to Part Time Employees. I paid about $19.00 a month for myself and my spouse for great medical insurance. I paid because I had a Supervisor position, regular Part Time employees pay nothing for medical insurance.  Low pay and great Benefits"
good,I was only a seasonal truck unloader.  Seasonal workers get less hours than full time hires.  Full time hires get full benefits but as a seasonal worker I did not get them.
good,All of my training was on the job training from my coworkers.  They were the only company willing to hire a 66 year old retiree and although the pay is low it's the only job I have so I'm still there.
good,deliver 300 plus packages. can get stressful. hours are too long. too much work. they demand too much. best part is the people you meet. barely any time to spend with the family.
good,"Working at The UPS Store, Inc. is different but fun. The people are fun and great team players. Management can be difficult but they offer great health benefits."
good,"Although, the job was an quite stressful job you build your patience, you endurance, you speed, and even your strength. The stuff obstacle is coming to work every on time and by the end of the week you see less than 300 dollars i was definitely devesated when first seeing my check stub but i held in there thinking the time i paid off while being and full time ready and working employee until the same pay after momths kept coming , i just couldn’t manage"
good,"Daily task at UPS does varies depending on circumstances which keep it exciting. Plus the supervisor and managements ensure there staff safety and compensate if they're not well to perform specific task. Its can be a fast pace environment, must be be capable of lifting anything above 50lb, which at time can be too much strain for the body."
good,"If you end of in management, it is an amazing place to develop your skills. Since it is such a huge company you will always encounter problems. The fun comes in creatively coming to a resolution in minutes, or even seconds for that problem. The environment is next level fast paced so your day ends as soon as it starts (At least where I managed). And UPS is continually striving to improve in everything it does, from production, work area, people, etc."
good,There is room for advancement if you want to become a driver. They pay very well but all supervisor positions are part time if you do not drive. I love ups just need to find something more better
good,This company has not promoted any part- time employee within my center in a while and when someone was promoted it was someone who was a friend of the managers.  This behavior continues to happen all of the time.  I have given my all to this company for the past 9 years and I am still a part-time employee.
good,"They hired me on over the holiday season. They made no mention that it was seasonal and never intended to keep me.  When I was hired they stressed that if you accept the job you have to stay on for a full year or else they would never hire you again. So I happily said I would. two weeks later they laid everyone off.  Didn't make sense. Be aware that job security is non existent here. The work can be extremely strenuous, and it is hard to balance a normal life and this job. They talk about the benefits but in most cases it feels like they never intend to give you those benefits. I would advise against applying in a peak season if you wanna keep your job."
good,After 1st month bodyget used the muscle ache loss of stamina from loading unloading and sorting packages ranging from 1 pounds to 180  pounds all different sizes
good,"Each business unit is different, some better than others. Management sometimes focuses on numbers more than people providing unease among workforce.  Good Managers overall, but often over-worked."
good,Decent place to work but the pay and hours aren’t worth it honestly. The benefits are great but that’s about it. It takes too long to become full time and people can’t live on part time work with the low pay.
good,"As my first ever corporate job at UPS, it was a great experience working for such a prestigious company. Everyone is very collaborative and helpful. Management is always looking to help individuals grow in their career."
good,A typical day at work is basically going in and lifting packages through your whole shift everyday onto trucks. Workplace culture is not so great and the hardest part of the job is definitely the body anchoring you have to do.
good,"Typical day -  Managing employees and customer to meet daily production output."
good,So at ups you come into a lot of people working in different areas and a lot of race problems like i had bosses basically talk down on me to make me not even want to be there.
good,I was definitely happy with the job and my driver was a great person who I became friends with however as I stated before not being paid on time on three separate occasions is frustrating during holiday season. It definitely had an impact on my life.
good,"The expectation for a full time supervisor is to work 50 hours per week. Some areas of the corporate allow that, others do not. On average you rotate every two years, but training is minimal. The people that work here in Management are great, very experienced, driven professionals. The reason for my low rating is for Work/Life balance. They are flexible, but as a UPSer your work is never done and you cannot leave it at work when you leave. You are constantly working, thinking about it and trying to figure out how to get all your tasks done. On average, most supervisors work between 50-70 hours per week."
good,"Fast quick paced environment, no down time at all.  Only given one 10 minute break for 8 hour shift."
good,"Driver helper was a seasonal position.  My experience during that time was good.  I learned a lot about a  job I never worked before.  The pay was good although it took them a  few times to get it right.  The opportunity was there to work many hours.  I didn't have to much interaction with managers or supervisors, but those that I dealt with were decent people."
good,I feel workers should get paid more especially with the demanding work that is expected. Management definitely needs some improvement. The breaks go by very fast.
good,"UPS is a very fast paced and often stressful job, particularly for management who are tasked with meeting strict production numbers on a daily basis, often putting them at odds with the unionized hourly employees. However, the job is incredibly secure as the industry is constantly growing, demanding a larger and larger workforce. Furthermore, the company provides both management and hourly/union employees with unparalleled health and dental benefits along with excellent tuition reimbursement and 401k programs."
good,"UPS began to cut hours, lay off employees and not hold all employees to same standards.  I loved working with Customers, other employees and my immediate Supervisor but Upper Management made promises and never followed through."
good,Don't go into management. Stay a union employee and enjoy job security and better benefits. Being management is extremely stressful and actually ended my career there.
good,Fast paced environment with a locker room type culture.  Management skill are constantly tested. You need to be able to make snap decisions and will be held accountable for all failures.
good,"Sesonal job "
good,UPS would be a great company if you would be able to obtain a full time position. However traveling from Waynesboro PA for a part time position is just not feasible for me.
good,"It's a job, so gratitude is should be ever present. I liked my co-workers most of the time. Management could stand to take a few oral communications classes, as it is very easy to become one regardless of work history ( you could very easily have a 20 year old become your head supervisor within 90 days of employment)."
good,Fast paced environment. Stacking skills required for packages being loaded into trailers. Late hours with low pay and low hours per week. I liked the fast paced parts.
good,"UPS provides a vital service to the country and the world. UPS asks a lot from their employees but offers numerous secondary benefits and competitive salaries. Work-life balance can be tough but simply put, UPS will take care of it's employees the rest of their lives, which is exceedingly rare in today's dynamic economy."
good,Did enjoy the environment and the employees but it was only a part time job until i could get a full time job. I have a family so i could not provide for them on this income.
good,"A typical day at work involve unloading and loading trucks. What i learned the most about working with boxes, is lifting and lowering skills. UPS has a great work culture."
good,"The scheduled hours for days vary, so the ""5p -10p M-F"" may be more like 430p-10p etc."
good,"It was a lot to learn. It's easy, but a lot. I think they should have a least paid $9 an hour as well. Training was kind of weird. They would show me something once and expect me to know what I'm doing right after, That was annoying. That was the only bad thing tho."
good,"It's a job that is more beneficial in the long run. It's not easy, but it is possible. I work here and attend university because of the hours. Not something I would want to do long-term."
good,"I personally enjoy work at a fast and steady pace, so this job is the right fit for myself. But the supervisor for my work crew was horrible, untimely and always has something negative to say to not just her employees, but her fellow co-workers."
good,"The company is unfair with promoting current employees. The company has excellent benefits. If you get a good business manger, then you may be treated fairly."
good,"For over seven years I was a delivery driver. The remaining years I was a supervisor in the following departments: Customer Service, Industrial Engineering, Delivery and Human Resources. I had to utilize numerous skill sets which included, being self-motivated as well as motivating others. My skills also included, time management, multi-tasking, sales, computer, communications and listening skills. I performed time studies, interviewed, hired, processed, trained, supervised and managed personnel. I attribute all of the skills I currently have to UPS and the time I worked there.This is the most demanding company you will ever work for. There is however a lot of pride when you look at how most people don't work nearly as hard for the money they make. This company also believes in training their personnel both hourly and management. The company offers more benefits than most companies and these benefits extend to part-time employees and the benefits include tuition reimbursement. UPS hires most of their full-time employees from their part-time ranks with is another benefit. The turn over is high in the part-time ranks because of the physical and high paced work. Most people who come in thinking they can handle this type of work quickly learn that they can't. I have seen athletes, previous armed forces and people from other delivery companies try and fail at this job. I have seen management people quickly burn out. I loved my job their and was very proud of my work. I had an opportunity to work with my father and could not turn down the opportunity and had to leave."
good,"A lot of movement for hours. Heavy boxes, along with your own trucks to pack off a belt. Alot of people in one place. Very cold at time, and products."
good,Well ups was a job job pay good and lots of good benefits it’s just I couldn’t handle that job to much heavy lifting and my body is not fit for it but if you like the type of work enjoy
good,Fun job culture. Workplace everyone helpful. I learned how to work at a steady pace. Employees were helpful. Learned how to load and unload trucks. Job funded lunches.
good,A typical work day is fast paced and I learned how to read codes for the packages. All the supervisors were nice and very helpful when I started working there.
good,"I liked the drivers and helping the customers resolve their package issues. I disliked the pettiness of some management and loss prevention guy harassed the operation managers working dispatch out with frivolous matters such as parking and cellphones. No immediate room for advancement. Hours were part-time so you can have a life and got paid weekly, wonderful benefits."
good,"A typical day at UPS begins with me arrive, going through security and waiting outside for someone to come collect me (no matter if it rains or snow, no matter if I am an hour early as I usually am because I live 1 hour and 30 minutes away and have to take public transportation to get there). After that I have to wait for the overnight crew to finish loading all the packages in the truck, more often than not my manager tells me to go lend them a hand, while at the same time I am also having to deal with fixing the truck up that they didn't and never do correctly. after all that is settle we leave a hour or so late, and we drive through the busy streets until we reach our first set of delivery points, where I am loaded with packages and set to do the whole street and meet my driver on the next street were he will either be done with his street or most often he isn't and I help with his street. The hardest part of the job is the weather she can be a killer, especially when your out there until 12 am most nights. The most enjoyable part of my job is my driver I was lucky enough to be pair with one of the good drivers and I enjoy the fun times."
good,The nice thing is that they provided transportation.The bus was full of teenagers and it reeked of weed.Not Ups's fault.My trainer and boss were wonderful.The place is dark and dirty.All you hear is how everyone (expletive) hates their job.People were passing out and just walking off the job.It is REALLY hard work..you will be soaked with sweat.It is pt and you will only get 2-4 hours a day.I got a hernia so l had to go.Nice for some extra christmas money.
good,I was a dedicated employee for years and the second I needed work family balance they turned they're back.  I don't like how mgmt. moves constantly and how nobody has a say in where they go or what they do.
good,"Most of the people were fine, but I had a real discontent with one of the employees that came in late and blamed what they did not have hands on with, that their failure was mine.  That is elementary, come on we are adults here."
good,As an hourly and management employee at UPS this job was discovered to be a fast paced and stressful. I managed to make this place work conveniently for me as an hourly employee.
good,Good place to work. Hot in the summer/cold in the winter. The most enjoyable was meeting co-workers daily. The hardest part was working on the sort isle with packages constantly around your feet/on the floor.
good,When working at UPS you be able to transport packages at a consistent pace and manage standing for over long periods of time. The job also requires you to work safely as well.
good,"fast pace which requires hard work dedication.keeps you in shape, great benefits that gives plenty of opportunity. U.P.S paves a way for your future for whom want to grow and expand. great place to work!"
good,UPS is a good place to work at if your not looking for a job with a lot of hours. a typical day at work would be going to work for 2 hours. constantly lifting heavy objects.
good,"The job is tough and time is always against you. A constant sense of urgency and keeping busy is what's required to work in this place. Great benefits, but very poor management and HR communication. Perhaps in bigger cities this wouldn't be a problem."
good,"Ups was a my first actual job. I learned a lot in a little spand of time. I was promoted within a 1 to sorter only cause they were short in staff and I scored high on the test to become sorter. workforce was fun, enjoyed laugher on the job"
good,"Loved my job, but had a jerk supervisor!  Loved the physical aspect of the job and seeing several customers on a daily basis.  My co-workers were amazing!"
good,"I worked as an international air-driver so I got a transport Canada Clearance Pass. Learned the rules for customs documentation,; became a package-car-driver and found it too heavy of a work load being a new-mother and full time heavy job. I loved the job, just couldn't do EVERYTHING I wanted to do at the time."
good,This job is not good for people who cannot handle a fast paced work environment and isn't for people who want to get paid less for the same work as others.
good,"Wasn't as professional as past employers. Benefits are great but hard to achieve a good work/life balance. Its a union which is nice, but seniority is king and to get more desirable shifts you have to have been there for years."
good,It was a pretty openly hostile environment between union employees and management.  It was actually a great company but maybe not so great for an individual worker.  I have arthritis in my back from doing repetitive manual labor here.... and I'm only in my 30's.
good,"A typical work day is working with 9 people. Out of those 9 people we each have our own trailers to load. The hardest part of the job really depends on how much volume we're going to get that day. For management its done poorly, when we need help it seems that they tend to take some of our staff and place them somewhere else and/or they send them home. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with the crew members. We all get along and we always go and help each other out when one of us needs it without asking."
good,"Though I wasn't too fond of the hours, I liked working there. Despite it only being a temporary position, the time that I was there I received good hours and decent pay."
good,Every minute counts. So your day is typically accounted for. The processes necessary for package delivery. All in all it is a good company. The hardest part is getting more work load but not necessarily additional time to complete.
good,"It's a hard job, you work your body out. The cons are the dust in the air, and I he heat. Employees get along with each other. They have really good benefits."
good,Supervisors always trying to break the rules of the contract if you arent smart enough to notice. Job description says lift up to 70lbs but i lift 150lbs daily. Supervisors like to try and force you to do overtime and will even threaten your job if you dont stay. However if you dont they can't do anything because of union contract. Bathroom is easilly over 100 degrees at times and the pay sucks and you only get a 10min break for a 5-8hour shif. DO NOT APPLY UNLESS IT IS YOUR ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT.
good,"Loading isnt bad but supervision sucks. Employees want to leave as soon as they can and do as little as possible. Lower management wants the dock to look clean and run smooth, upper management wants the dock to run productively which means cut hours anytime you can. Cut more hours, dock runs less smooth, people get mad and load slower. Run the dock clean, you use more hours and people take a mile and slow down, all in all someones always mad at you."
good,"loading heavy boxes into feeders or cans is a typical day. I've learned how to fill out shipment papers. safety procedures, how to lead and unload properly, how to deal with hazardous materials."
good,i like that it was fast past lots of friendly people great staff maybe if i had more time to work there i would have a litte more to say but it was just temp
good,I think ups is a good job if you looking for part time work . As far as full time I don't think it's as good . Because full time you want at least 30 hours out the week
good,"great company if you can take the time to wait to move up within the company, it can take many years to be promoted. and the work itself is very strenous, and the pay for the amount of hours you get is very low."
good,Great Benefits. I would highly recommend. There are some SAFETY ISSUES THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. Better pay and more hours would be helpful. Union is a plus.
good,"duties include loading/unloading trucks prior to and after delivery routes delivering packages to companies/homes and obtaining signatures upon delivery, working in a very fast-paced environment and maintaining speed to meet strict delivery deadlines, assisting with duties on an as needed basis."
good,"A positive attitude works wonders.  It is a physical job. If you want to have a good time and have a positive experience, bring it to work.  The work is demanding and that can be satisfying."
good,"Most employees begin as part-time employees and will remain at that status for years. The options for advancing to full-time are limited to becoming a driver (very physically and time demanding) or investing many years to climbing the ladder in management. Most management position require a degree and/or many years of experience with the company. The management teams are not very hands on and usually place people in positions for which they are not prepared and just expect them to sink or swim. The hardest part of the job is lack of proper training, waiting for opportunities, stress, and mostly part time hours. The best part of the job is the salary, benefits, and many opportunities once promoted to full-time."
good,"Ups can be a great place to work. Yo just have to get behind a good staff and management. Ups offers excellent benefits for you and your family. I would say hands down best benefits I have ever had! But there is no room for advancement, and management can be bias toward certain employees."
good,I liked the work it was good balance of driving and loading or unloading and forklift driving. I was getting 40 + hrs a week until they started loosing accounts
good,"fast paced.. You earn every penny and the company gets every cent out of everything you do. The overall benefits help the employee and family, but its a lot of work to maintain it, as one puts a lot of hours."
good,would have my jug of water really to start the day we would do group stretches and get assigned a trailer with someone else or by ourselves or someone else would be with us.
good,We load 3 or 4 trucks everyday. We get a 10 minute break after our first 3 hours. I'll goal is to get everything in the truck as neat as possible and on time.
good,The job is really tough and fast paced. The workload is heavy and there are not many opportunities for breaks and the pay does not validate the workload.
good,"I like my job at UPS, however I do not like the amount of hours I receive per week. That is why I am seeking full time employment. The company has really good benefits and you get to meet a lot of great people. They give the employees healthy snacks to take home sometimes after work shifts. It takes a long time to become a full time employee at this company."
good,"Customers are hostile and do not understand importance of secure delivery and release of packages. Shipping out of packages is simple for domestic items and very detailed for international destination. Additional documents required for customs. Shipping requirements are priority to avoid damaging other packages in shipping to ground and air destinations."
good,I think working st ups is a great opportunity for and person young or old once getting a foot in the door could land you in a fortunate position the people there were easy to work with.
good,You'll load 3 Brown trucks was packages at a fast pace. Multiple packages come from a conveyor belt and you need to look for the right number and then put it on the right Shelf in the brown trucks. You might have to climb on the conveyor belt to get all of your packages. So lots of energy is needed. It's kind of like Tetris. You have to wait for somebody to sign you in when your new before they give you a badge so bring a jacket because you'll be waiting outside.
good,This job wasn't bad at all. You pretty much were able to do what you wanted. Management was great. The owners of the store weren't too great but they didn't show up much. It was tough with some of the customers too. The store sold and the new owners had their own people so not sure how good it is now.
good,"I have worked for this company for 6 years. A typical day for me would consist of ... get to work, heavy weight lifting for 4 to 5 hours on avg., and go home feeling drained. It's all manual labor, unless your a full-time Manager or you work an office. The hub that I am in has no air-conditioning or heating except for office jobs/management when they are in their offices. So summers are horribly hot (Texas), you are sweating profusely and feel miserable. Winters are the same minus the heat.  The majority of Management act like they are just there for a check or opportunity to overuse people just for advancements; pay very little attention to the needs of their employees. We only get one 10 minute break a day... whether we work 4 or 8 hours. The job i have is part-time except for the month of December, peak season, we get full time hours. Unless you go to driving or management, you have to wait about 10-12 years to get the opportunity for a full time position in the hub.  For the first two years that i worked there we had gotten good incentives like, cookouts monthly, pizza parties, and prizes on the regular- like t-shirts, bottles, hats, etc. if we got safety questions correct. The management that i had contact with were polite, caring, and appreciative of hard workers. Now the company has become filled with Management that is focus 90% on discipline and control. That leaves only 10% for reward. Those percentages aren't very good for increasing morale and productivity. I feel the Company could do a good bit more to improve these problems!!!"
good,"Unloading 1,500 packages a hour. Only working 2.5 - 4 hours a day . Only paid $130.00  a week. Managers are unorganized . I was also under trained for my job"
good,this is a pretty easy going place to work for and you learn a lot about customer service and much more important things in the workplace thats useful for any other workplace
good,Tough environment but good benefits. Fast paced warehouse type of work handling packages for distribution. Tuition reimbursement in some locations. Various shifts to work on.
good,"Just fair.Most executives with this kind of experience have a higher salary.Job security is very solid,and company promotes with in.Too much  volunteer work is asked from the employees, and too little compensation."
good,I believe the ups store is a great opportunity to learn the shipping side of retail. The company provides you with a lot of valuable information and experiences that will last a lifetime.
good,Management is terrible and rides the hard workers and does nothing to slackers. Pay and benefits become great the longer you work there. Stressful to the point where the hours doesn't make it worth it
good,The most hours I worked in a single night were 4 and a half hours. The work environment consists of fast pace mobility by moving packages onto conveyor belts. Everyone I worked with were very pleasant to be around and so kind to me. I wished they offered more hours and the job wasn't a seasonal position.
good,good environment with good people to work with.  Good benefits earn overtime and many chances for advancement at ups. I have no issues with ups and i enjoy working there
good,I liked the company because it was full of diversity. The company had okay benefits and the managers talked to you any kind of way. But other than that the job was fun I mite add.
good,while working at UPS you're going to do one thing and that's for sure you are going to work and sweat your butt off the benefits are awesome at UPS that had some of the best benefits in the world but you will indeed work for them
good,The Hardest part about this job is the constantly moving or running. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the nice and cool people on the delivery route.
good,"UPS' number 1 priority was speed. each package was pulled off the truck at the rate of 1000/hour, sorted at the same, further sorted at 600/hour, and loaded onto package cars at 222/hour. It was very regulated and fast paced. The benefits package was incredible, and came without cost."
good,Had a place that let us sit down and eat also a pizza shop that gives us free pizza every other day. It was a good experience and i learned great team work from working there.
good,You lift and move packages and put them on trucks if you are not in unload if you are in unload you just unload the trailers and send them down the belt
good,"If you work hard you can keep your job and stay comfortable, management is okay. its different then most companies, yet they yet will help you if they see that you are really struggling."
good,UPS is backed by a union and you are protected so job security is there. The 401k makes money fast and you will be surprised how quickly it builds. You can get promoted and have a career with them.
good,"A typical day is filled with uncertainties. "
good,"Though it was a overnight job, the environment was always upbeat and fun. Met good people during the temp position. Learned a lot in a small time there."
good,"The supervisor at the one in Stafford, Tx is very unprofessional they curse and talk to there employee's like trash but other than that its a nice place to work"
good,"UPS is a solid place to work if you are looking to stay there forever. If you don't have years under your belt, you're going to have a much tougher time. After a year, you get paid time off & insurance. Your job gets easier the longer you stay there. However, you have to stay there forever to climb the seniority list. The management could definitely be improved. The Knoxville hub could run much smoother if it weren't for the lack of motivated workers."
good,"It was very busy and could get a lot of hours. Holidays things got a bit horrifying, but other than that a great job to have. A learning experience as well. Would love to work here again."
good,"Low pay and little opportunities for advancement, but overall a fulfilling work experience. Supervisors were excellent, management was excellent, and the company takes safety seriously as it should."
good,"I worked for UPS for half a year, and all I really have to say is that it is a very very fast paced and stressful job, you have to look out where you step and put any part of your body no matter where you are at in the Hub's"
good,"If you know how to drive a manual transmission vehicle then this is the perfect job for you. Advancement in the job are contingent upon that fact. However, if you are content with permanent part time you should work here."
good,"Ups is like a work out under pressure, you have to stay hydrated, no air conditioning so how it feels outside is how it feels inside, be motivated to work"
good,"A day at work is usually very busy from beginning to end. You'll learn how to read package labels and how to correctly load trucks with said packages. The work is hard, sometimes disorganized, so while satisfying it can also be frustrating."
good,"I learned a lot working at UPS. I first started it was Fritz and then UPS bought them out. The hardest part of this job was impationte drivers starring at you, or getting upset because it was taking longer to get their shipment cleared through customs."
good,Love my job until the last manager I had made me feel very uncomfortable that made me hate my job and end up leaving for that reason felt no support from upper management.
good,Half of your career will be spent on 2nd or 3rd shift. Advancement is slow but job security is a premium and management provides good leadership. Be prepared to move in order to advance.
good,"The wages are decent, but it takes forever to get full time. And the medical package that kicks in after a year is fantastic. Great job security through the Union."
good,"The timeing in my life was bad, I had just lost my husband and was not ready to get into a fulltime job with so much pressure. There was a lot of pressure to acquire at least 3 contracts per week. Training was haphazard on the floor. I was skipped over or ignored when I asked for advanced help for writing bids for contracts, there were standard contracts but many needed to be specialized and I couldn't get the help I needed or the coaches were so busy they did them for me instead of doing their job of teaching the formula so I could acquire the skill and be proficient on my own. This caused more stress because I felt I was getting behind."
good,"my facility offers NO opportunity for advancement. There is an all new mgmt. team with little to no experience, no structure, unprofessional, young & arrogant.  The company has greatly decline under the new leadership."
good,"Horrible management. Belittles employees, curses them out. Honestly, the management does what they are required to do but are poorly trained and most aren't a good fit for the manager position. "
good,"I learned a lot here. This company has benefits comparable to the military and you will understand why if you continue to seek a career here. Tuition reimbursement, great healthcare."
good,"I feel UPS could be a little better than what they are. The people there are great for most part, but the delivers have to work on. But along with the great workers comes a big headache, not everyone is on page. But at the end of the day you have great benefits and good pay. It's up to you ""WHAT BROWN DOES FOR YOU."""
good,"UPS is a good job but one that needs a strong individual. The stress level is very high, and if you are not one who does well under pressure or gets angry quickly than this is not the place for you."
good,The job a UPS was a lot of work especially during the holiday rush. The benefits were great at UPS they even offered health insurance for part time workers.
good,[when i was working here the days were going so slow but the packages were moving so fast i learned how to move faster than normal paste.Even though everything was moving fast i still manged to keep up.
good,if you take a day off you will not become full time and they will  get rid of you soon as the season is over.  the people you work with are good people they want to see you win.  the work areas are a little   crazy if your not use to being around machines and loud noises
good,"There is room for improvement for UPS. Doing everything by hand is okay but, when your competition is using machines you need to get with the times, The management is better than Amazons will admit that but they are petty as well."
good,"I worked there for three months. I liked my job, and the company in general, but the starting wage was extremely low. Facility managers were good hard working people, but they had issues in dealing with troublesome employees because of the union. I resigned because of a couple of employees that did whatever they wanted, and refused to do what they didn't  want to do. So, whatever they didn't  want to do, I had to do. All they did was troll others, and did very little themselves. I was not willing to deal with that . I do have to say that there were many good hard working people there at the Mechanicsburg facility.."
good,"Most of the time is slow, unless you are a notary. There is a notary almost every day. It gets busy during the holidays and tax season. Packing is fun, at first tfhen is like a routine. Exiting when. It was big jobs like computers, tv's, or  furniture."
good,"How can a job that you work so hard and put in these hours and get paid drop ? Because the employee has to hit a certain numbers and constantly try to get the right amount of money, if so miss 1 day paid drop to 9.50"
good,"The management there was very good, and took care of their employees.  They didn't mind the few times I called in sick because of messing up my back the day before at work, and didn't give me a hard time for it.  However, some of the company policies make it very hard to sustain working here when you first start out.  You're only working part time, generally around 20-25 hours a week, and you don't get any health/dental benefits until you've been there for at least a year.  The same goes for time off.  Also, advancement is very hard.  The only people I knew that were working there full time had been there for 10+ years, and if you hope to eventually become a driver, you have to be there for even longer.  The hardest part of the job is just how fast paced it is.  You are expected to be able to scan and load 300 packages an hour into the trailers, which may not sound like a lot, but to keep up with that pace you'll probably be breaking a sweat.  Also, you will occasionally have to lift very heavy boxes, up to 75 lbs by yourself or up to 150 lbs with help.  All in all, not a bad job, but new employees are not treated well when they first start out by company policy."
good,UPS is a great company.  Long hours with little to no work life balance.  The benefits were excellent.  The Management changed every six months and the culture was some what difficult.
good,"The average person is asleep at this time of work, so hopefully you are a morning person. the work isn't very difficult, pretty routine but at the same time can be quite difficult getting used to."
good,"daily delivery of packages on an assigned delivery route. 8 to 13 hrs daily. went to school for driver training. management is not union, therefor have different agenda then drivers. hardest part was non stop work no lunch. most enjoyable working by myself and meeting new people/customers."
good,"Fast pace working environment"
good,"The job overall is an interesting experience. It was my first real job, there were a lot of ups and downs. UPS always keeps an eye on their employees which is a good thing. Ups has great benefits, like one important they pay for college"
good,UPS is a great company if you take away the horrible way they speak to their employees and treat them like they do not matter. I learned if you know the right people you don't need skill. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck
good,There are several shifts available to work around all kinds of lifestyles. The pay is ok but not unfair. They offer rewards for attendance and reward employees with bonuses for continuing to work with UPS. The managers have always been friendly. Work is pretty monotonous but you can get a lot done and breeze through the day if you get into a routine. Be ready to do lots of physical work and be in extreme hot or cold environments depending on the season.
good,Very fast paced environment. constant mobility when loading trucks. Didn't get along with manager to well. Hardest part of the job was sometimes sticking packages in a neatly manner.
good,"Opportunities are there if you do not worry about a work life balance."
good,"Overall the customers are great, especially the regulars! Scheduling is pretty fair just be sure you ask off ahead of time. The store is not too busy and once you have done everything needed around the store you just have to wait on customers and sometimes it's not that busy!"
good,"During the summer, working at UPS gets extremely uncomfortable due to the heat. If you are a package handler, you are in the back of a truck trailer for about four hours creating walls of boxes until your shift is over. The work is easy to catch on to, and once you get the hang of it it becomes rather repetitive. In the winter, the trucks are cold and you need to make sure to wear a jacket. All the managers are young adults, so the atmosphere is positive and everyone is trying to encourage one another."
good,"Its a good first job outside of summer jobs and camps. A good way to gain work experience. I wouldn't stay there long term if I had a choice which is why I didn't. Some major things I did not  like about the job is that there was no air condition and no heat, which can quickly become a problem, especially in the summer and winter months. Management was okay. Getting injured on the job is almost a guarantee. All in all its good short term maybe seasonal but not as a career at least not for me."
good,"Lots of hard workers, easy short days. good management. nice employees and managers. hardest part of the job is picking up and handling packages as some can be very heavy."
good,"This was a tough work environment but at the end of the day, you could related that you had accomplished your goals of making sure that parcel packages were packed and were to be delivered to their destination on time."
good,Its a good working environment with great employees and supervisors.  They make sure your well trained and fit for the position you applied for.  I would recommend this job with a family member or friend
good,"The job itself and the employees there were nice and straight forward, but managers often go against each other which led to problems between people at work. Also the graveyard shift made it hard to balance work and school."
good,The shift I would work didn't allow me to make enough to pay for all my expenses so I had to leave but overall it was great working a union job and I regret that I could not get more hours
good,"you spend a quarter of the work day loading packages, the rest is spent on deliveries. you are required to take package from truck to door step. Sometimes its required to get a signature from the person recieving packages."
good,Well i work at the UPS air hub and higher management are just horrible to work with.. for example not letting you take a lunch and dismissing you when there is still work to complete.
good,"The working pace is insane, the people that works there are very unfriendly and not much willing to help newcomers. The hours of work are a few a day but the amount of work o complete in one hour is incredible. some managers are nice and understanding whereas others are very strict and intense on workers."
good,Its a great company if you enjoy working out and the benefits or good plus its great for anyone who is going to school. The warehouse is fast paced and there is a short break 10 min for part time employers.
good,"great place to get a start in the workforce as a young adult, learned shipping laws and rules, love the customers and fellow employees, also learned how to get task done faster working a group."
good,Hard work for sure. Great benifits after a year. Management needs work. Also needs to open more jobs for insiders. Maybe more full time jobs would actually keep people with the company.
good,"Loading/unloading trailers, required to work in a fast paced manner while working safely. Work was fairly rewarding as there was a sense of accomplishment after a hard days work. As far as the workplace goes it can be rough, the hours are part time but the benefits are very good. Probable the best part about working there. Pay starts low and incrementally works its way up the longer you stay."
good,The daily life at UPS is a very intense five hour shift. This is not a job for the average worker but someone who is in shape and ready to work. This is a great job for college students as some hubs like the Toledo Hub helps pay for your school tuition. Roughly $2600 per semester.
good,Time goes by very fast. Never a dull day. No time for family. The pay is good. The employees are there for life.  Most employees stay until they retire.  The pay is at the top of the industry.
good,"Job was very fast paced, physical environment that changed hourly. Terrible hours and stressful work load as well as mis-management. It was good exercise but very hard on the body."
good,"Very high energy, fast paced enviroment"
good,Long and hardworking.Takes alot of strength and endurance.Learned how to work independently and at a fast pace. Supervisors are hard on you expect you to get the job done.
good,"Ups was a decent place to work, the pay was bad but once you passed 5 hours on a shift you hit overtime after that you made $16.50. This place had great people, every employee had great personalities."
good,"This job was very fast paced, the worker were very ruded and manger acted as if they didnt care if you stayed or leave, but UPS is a great opportunity for someone."
good,"el dia a dia en esta empresa, era una rutina repetitiva que si se te olvidaba algo del proceso estabas en indiferencia con alguien."
good,"working hard everyday"
good,Same as my previous review since it was the same company just a differrent department. More freedom to make changes without being micro managed. Fun time with the drivers.
good,Works pretty good .It kept me very busy throughout the day. I liked the pay rate also how the customers greeted me in such a staggering way. One day I wish to go back.
good,"It's upsetting to see so many people who, if they only worked together, could achieve so much for the company. But they are so busy staying at each others throats you can't possibly make any true progress without stepping on them. Friends are few and far between and expect to be thrown under the bus immediately if it benefits them."
good,You'll undoubtedly have to clear hoop after hoop and never be hired permanently. Each facility either does or does not thoroughly check into backgrounds. I was employable in NC but not TN. Just too much.
good,It's cool to work there if you not looking for a career and just want the benefits. Great benefits and part time job. You have to be physical team player motivate and multiple times.
good,good communciation with people and management team
good,"A typical day at work consists of moving boxes. Management is for the most part friendly, but it is important to remember that they are chasing numbers and are probably the reason circumstances are needlessly difficult. Culture is sparse unless you smoke. The hardest part of the job is being upright and active for hours at a time. Getting paid for a decent workout is nice, though."
good,I would arrive and get to work right away. I would help customers with their packages and to find out where they went to send them. I would be polite and attentive to each customer.
good,Have been working here for 2 years the benefits kick in after a year and they have tuition reimbursement. However the work is very hard and supervisors and management don't do much physical work which can be a bit irritating at times.
good,"Working at The UPS Store was great."
good,"I worked at the Cerritos facility from Sept 2015 until Feb 2016. I'd probably still be at UPS but I accepted an offer to work inventory at a local home improvement store."
good,"Great company with a great brand with both a very committed management team and a dedicated workforce.  Solid business strategy with the ability to innovate, leverage technology and the capability to provide better solutions to end users."
good,Good with my hands and can get along with anybody a people person who can work and keep a fast past while learning or teaching
good,"UPS pays for your college, a very physical labor type job though. your job as a package handler at UPS is pretty simple, either load or unload trucks."
good,"Tough Labor No A/C or Heater ,environment is almost like a prison"
good,I get to work to set up my area. I stand for 4 hours flipping labels and making sure packages move through the belt and not constantly loop. I assist my supervisor efficiency that resulted in a faster work place.
good,"Good job overall"
good,"It's ok just not enough hrs, people are pretty nice though. Lots of confusion throughout work period. Benefits are great but don't apply till after one whole year."
good,"In a typical 17 hour week as a package handler (the majority of the hub) you check in, go to you station which is usually a package car, box line or freight, and once time starts (usually changes by 10- 15 minutes per day) all you will do is practice safety procedures to place a package from the station on to an assisted conveyor belt which then travels to another hub section to either loaded in some way. The job is straight forward and becomes monotonous after a while. No glamour, no cultural glitter, when you think of the boring brown logo, that is pretty much what working in the hub is like. The only reason why our group (there are groups of about 10 per section with in the hub and approximately 70-80 people in the hub at one time) is well developed and exciting is that we developed a unique flavored culture my passing myths, stories, and jokes around during breaks and having food days creating a social microcosm."
good,The job was harsh but payed well with multiple benefits. Management and employees worked tirelessly to provide a more proficient package carrying sevrice. All hard work was well appreciated despite the long and strenuous hours
good,I like working at UPS. I really miss the people more then the job. The union with UPS does protect its employees but it also creates a toxic environment between the good workers and the poor ones.
good,"I enjoyed the fact that the work days were almost always less than 8 hours. The people I worked alongside were very friendly for the most part. Although it was a bit physically demanding, I would prefer that over a sit-down job."
good,"Working at UPS has been a fun experience, there benefits are great but it does take a while to reach the good benefits. I started working during seasonal."
good,"When I arrive, I go to the meeting with my full time supervisor. He goes over the previous days/weeks numbers and our goals for the day. After the meeting, we go out to the floor, make sure we have all the trailers/equipment we need, make sure that we clock our package handlers in as they arrive. Throughout the 4 to 5 hour sort span, it is a high intensity environment. My management team and I ensure that our employees are working safely with a sense of urgency, making sure that every single package is sorted and loaded into the trailer of its proper destination. At the end of the sort, we had to make sure everything all equipment is stored and put back in it's a appropriate place, make sure that all trailers left on time to make their appropriate trains, ensure that all of our employees were paid properly, leave the work area clean leaving no packages or garbage on the floors and gratings, and turn in our daily paperwork to full time supervisor."
good,"While not a terrible place to work, it does however have it's share of problems that can underwhelm newcomers. I worked there for over a year, and in that time I tried repeatedly to climb the ladder and become a full timer, and with bills to pay working part time is unacceptable. Communication and interactions with management also fall short of tense. Because it is a huge warehouse not everybody seemed to be on the same page, so when you're doing your job 1 day you suddenly find yourself being yelled at by management  because they changed the rules or procedures and you were unaware."
good,"A typical day for me at UPS was starting at four in the morning, and working until nine in the morning. Working on more than one truck, being on my feet at all times, being paced faster everyday. I learned how to build T's within the boxes. I learned what to do and what not to do at UPS. The management was excellent, they know what needs to be done and how to get it done. some co-workers were helpful, while some were just bitter and rude. The hardest part of the job would probably be when the shift is almost over and I would get a real heavy package.  The most enjoyable part of working at UPS was probably the new experience. Instead of sitting and learning at school, I was doing everything I wanted to do while waiting to leave high school."
good,great coworkers fun place to work the hardest part of my job is that I'm getting older and not sure how much longer i can work there.looking to find something new and less painful on my body.
good,Perfect fit for people looking for extra income on a part time basis. Especially during the holiday season which is the busiest for them
good,I actually worked for the UPS Store which is different than UPS.  It was a part time job and I enjoyed working there until a better job opportunity became available
good,I hated this job boring and very demanding and hard work it's cold and it's hard long hours but it's easy work just heavy loads which make it hard
good,Temporary/seasonal work is all that is offered. If looking for something long term or permanent this is not the position for you. Job involves heavy lifting and withstanding the elements. You must be able to drive a manual (stick shift) truck and be available to be sent away to training for a week.
good,"My job was to make sure all pacakage wete pack properly with the correct sticker . I've also done some scanning & packing trucks."
good,if you focus and buckle down you will fit right in. just pay attention in the training classes. the hardest part of the job is all the accounts you have to deal with and special pricing for each one.
good,I worked at ups for 4 years at the most busy spot there and that really helped me out n the long run cause I don't get Frustrated at hard work just put my head down and just work
good,Great  place to work.. nice Supervisor.. we had great Luncheon.. The Benefits was awesome.. hours was great.. I was a strong Material Handlers.. that pull orders and kept products in the correct location..
good,A average day at work was productive and fast paced. I learned new skills that i didn't previously know. Management was fair and i had a great relationship with the management team. The hardest part of the job may have been lifting very heavy packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay that i was able to receive to help feed me and my family.
good,Like every job it has its up's and downs. I would like to keep my opinions to myself. They are contracted accounts so your future is not a guarantee....
good,Very good benefits that part time employees are entitled to after 1 year of work. Dental vision and medical provided by the comopany.
good,"A fast pace and heavy lifting required."
good,"Labor intensive work"
good,I've learned many runs at UPS many area's. I'm soo much better on the road now.  I have great good co-workers. We all help each other.the thing that I don't like is long hours you never know at what time you will finished. it's a 10 hour day.
good,"Must be dress for the job, mentally ready for the job and physically ready for the job everyday. Work Monday thou Friday 30 hours a week. It's a friendly environment and had to work in teams to get the job done quickly. The raises was low and not enough pay."
good,Come in load/sort boxes on a belt into a trailor at fast paste until the shift is over with very active job its a good job and has great benefits that come with it
good,"Management Needs to work on dealing with situations better. Other than that, benefits are good and good coworkers, and need to work on dealing with newer people better."
good,"This Job Was Very Demanding,"
good,"Needless to say, all UPS Stores are different. My particular store is pretty easy going. The managers are nice and not too hard on me. I don't have any problems with the customers at my store. So far, my coworkers have been pretty good and we have gotten along. The work is not that hard, but there is a lot to remember."
good,It was like a work out when I get to work. I learned how to build a wall with boxes and safety rules. I hardest thing was the heavy tracks but still was fun if you had good team to help you unload it.
good,"I currently work overnight shift which at times can be difficult, but my co-workers and management help with making it easier. They are supportive in the community and charities. It's like a family, when someone is need of assistance, they all pull together to find the best way to assist."
good,Face paced work environment. Family like work place. Most people have been with the company for over a decade. The hardest part of the job is the long hours we put in during the holiday season.
good,Have to be dedicated to work hard at a fast pace for long periods of time. No air conditioning in the summer and very little heat in the winter. Great health benefits and Good pay. You work very hard for the salary you earn.
good,"They have very good benefits. The tuition assistance was good also, but besides driving advancement is hard to come by."
good,"Any workday at UPS as a package handler is almost exactly the same. We come to work a few minutes early so that our supervisor can account us, not forgetting to bring appropriate hydration and attire. Everyone locates their own work area along the conveyor belt, everyone yearning for the spot near the fan. The packages come slow at first but they, without warning, can come out as a torrent. Soon the shouts concerning the state of the packages come as a chorus ringing above the ever-present whine of the belts. My supervisor trying as best as he can in an attempt to manage the situation. Some of my co-workers, those who've been there long enough that they are not as weary as the rest of us, strike up conversations here and there, trying to pass the time before the boredom consumes our minds. The most difficult part of the job is also what I find most satisfactory, which is to sort packages. What I learned from my short but maddeningly-long time there is that the most strenuous work can bring the most illogical joy."
good,"Learning to achieve companies policies and procedures. Keeping all employees safety, and uphold company quality services, and making company have efficient production goals."
good,While not for everyone UPS offers many challenging opportunities. A very conservative company that changed a lot once they went public. Many of the senior people have worked in the operations area so that tends to influence the overall culture quiet a bit.
good,"Lucky me, I had the one where my owner wouldn't pay me for the hours I worked. If you decide to work here, I recommend talking to the employees first to see what they say about the owner."
good,Good benefits but takes years of hard work for any type of advancement. Management has lots of turnover so it`s difficult to grow with your supervisor. All in all a good second job.
good,"I have have worked here for a good 15 years now. I have had more ups and downs than a roller coaster working here. As a (part-timer employee) with quote on quote good hours, I'm barely making a living. You can expect to be a par-timer 20+ years before being considered for a full-time UNION HOURLY position. I'm college educated. But, opportunities here are hard to come by. The only way up the ladder is becoming a par-time supervisor. And that, quite often the case is where you'll be stuck in limbo for the rest of your UPS career. "
good,"A typical work day includes unloading and loading trailers with a forklift. Management lacks the motivation to improve operation performance and the employees give substantially low effort to load trailers correctly without the damage of freight. The hardest part of this job is trying to be a christian and show compassion towards everyone 100% of the time. I've learned how to pilot agitated co-workers into a more peaceful state of mind during my time at UPS FREIGHT. The most enjoyable part however, is holiday pay on Christmas, Thanksgiving, Independence day, and more."
good,"In this physical and fast-paced position, package handlers continually lift, lower and slide package between 25 and 70 lbs. Great for college students and parents, part-time employees usually work 3 to 4 hours a day, Monday through Friday. We also offer a variety of shifts throughout the day and evening to help make the world work better for you."
good,"Had a week where I only got 5 hours of work in. Other than that, the work was pretty alright. Management was friendly and compromising. The hardest part of the job was getting hours, however."
good,"In my particular location management tries to fit entirely to much volume into a four or five hour shift. In my opinion in order to get that much volume out, an eight hour shift would be much more reasonable. I personally was told by a full time supervisor that in my time period at the company,three years, I had loaded more packages than any other employee, but when I voiced my opinion that as the company grows management is asking to much of their hourly workers in such a short period of time they told me I just needed to ""get in there and do my job."" When I tried to reason further I was told by a member of management that ""You need to watch yourself you now have a target on your back to get fired."" I often leave a five hour shift feeling like I have worked a very hard ten or twelve hour shift comparable to when  I used to work asphalt construction."
good,"A typical day at work is long and very diversified in calls, i learned to manage my work pressure and manage the customers accordingly to the situation, co-workers treat you like a Team. Hardest part is finding a solution instantly, and the most enjoyable part of the job is solving a customers issue . location lachine"
good,"job is very challenging place to work for. big organization, fast pace. hard work. must be aware of your surrounding. safety is emphasis. management can be difficult at times. must co worker are easy to get along with"
good,Having the union there really makes if a us vs them environment. it could be so much more cooperative. benefits are good though.
good,I have been here for 15 years  they offer great benefits if you are committed to staying there for a long time. i go into work at midnight and get off at 4.  learned how a union operates.  love my coworkers.  hardest par of the job is the night shift.  most enjoyable part is the coworkers.  management is ok.
good,"They are a very secure and well established company."
good,UPS is a very demanding and rewarding company.  Hours range from 10-14 hrs. per day.  It is a very secure and forward thinking company that challenges each employee on a daily basis.
good,Perfect environment for an individual that is not afraid to work hard and sweat. Lots of room for moving up in the company.
good,Typically the day started around 10am and persisted to around 6-8pm.  The most challenging part of the job was how labor intensive it can get.
good,"Coworkers were great. Every day was something more to learn about. Needed a better owner at the specific franchise. Helped most of the UPS drivers get the packages into the truck each day. Also this manager never gave me a W4 or W2 when I first started, he just took out the taxes out himself and wrote me a check each payday."
good,"na High stress, often demanding. Could do better in team building. I do not have any more to say about this position, management or leadership."
good,"Great place to develop workplace skills, great training for management. Great vision for the company, could do better with the sick days and personal holidays, retention is also a huge problem."
good,"Worked the 11 pm-3:30 am shift. A night would consist of using electronic devices to scan packages and properly load them into a truck trailer. These packages range from one pond to almost 70 lbs. when coming into the trucks via a belt system. Larger packages would require the use of a lift or another worker to team-lift because the packages would weigh more than 70 lbs. During peak season the packages will come down fast and sometimes overflow a belt, requiring some additional team member help and juggling the flow of packages based on the supervisors efforts. After peak season, the amount of trucks lessened and flow became slightly more steady. However, management would send people home early to try to cut costs and this could result in sometimes leaving right away or working half a shift. Most enjoyable was the hard work and moderate independence. However the work was steady and keeping package scan numbers up was a looming concern."
good,"When UPS Freight first bought Overnite Transportation things were going well.  But as time passed, it's highly sophisticated operation found cheaper ways to transport their freight utilizing rails and outside sub-contractors consistantly reducing their own board of road drivers.  so with my miles reduced now by 50% I now need to supplement my income else where.  I'm hoping to find a new part-time home company to work out of."
good,"UPS is a international company who specialises in clearing, forwarding and warehousing. They offer internal courses and look after their employees."
good,"Learn to interact with different types of person/management/non-management/colleagues/customer."
good,Working in the Ups AIR Hub was great. I would recommend this position to anyone looking for a seasonal job. Great Benefits along with great people
good,"management was the worst ever"
good,I had a route that covered 200+ miles every day.  I learned to drive safely in different road conditions.  Management was difficult to work with sometimes.  Most of the co-workers were good to work with.
good,ups would be a better job if they had better management that cared about the job more. I feel if the supervisers don't care about the job then the employee are going to have the same feelings.  if I don't care about my job then I don't need to be there.
good,"Everyday is something different, just depends on where you're at. People come in a variety but there is always someone to help."
good,"Starting out here there is a significant adjustment necessary, but once the adjustment is made could be manageable for anybody without any other engagements (do NOT work this job alongside college, it is not doable) Where I was though clearly has some issues they need to work out, from bad management to limited staff on hand. It became pretty clear to me after several months that the New Stanton Hub intended to overwork me for as little time/pay as possible. The relationship between unions and management is also a bit uneasy, get ready for some drama there. Above all else, be aware that working your hardest will not guarantee promotion, likeliest result will be you picking up slack for somebody who doesn't feel like working as hard."
good,"The work was easy. My managers were lovely people as were my co-workers. The best part was flexibility of scheduling. The hardest part was high turnover, constantly having new people to train."
good,"Fast-paced job that requires the ability to be flexible and have excellent communication skills. We also deal with safety, service and production on a daily basis."
good,My job consisted of handling packages making sure that they were in their designated areas in order to reach the customer in a safe and timely manner. Has the supervisor my job was somewhat easy going and drama free. I assisted the belt supervisor in maintaining a safe work environment as well as keep production running smoothly. My co-workers were easy going people that were there to complete a job and go home.
good,Its tough work for the money but its steady. Management is good and helpful. Hours are all nights which is tough and it takes a long time to become full-time.
good,U.P.S. was a good change of pace when I began my stint with the company. I was trusted with numerous responsibilities and expected to work accurately and efficiently.
good,"The pay is excellent .health care is 100 % paid with 100 %coverage...with exception to eye and dental which is about 70%..coverage...pension is outstanding..full package with wages and benefits is worth 130,000 yearly..without a college education I am grateful for the standard of living UPS HAS AFFORDED ME AND MY FAMILY! The only con is while your children are young you give up a lot of family time..I never got to watch my kids play sports and missed a lot of their growing years...the job can be hard on your home life but if you can make it through those years you and your family will enjoy the financial freedom that UPS provides...and now I look forward to a prosperous retirement!...so hang in there all you young drivers..."
good,"I'm a very social person, but the job limits that. The job promotes safety, but then does nothing to actually advance the safety procedures. The hours are inconsistent and it's a inconvenience. High risk low reward type of job. The benefits are nice, but takes a full year to receive them."
good,"This is where a sense of urgency was instilled in me.  I learned about performing work that was passed along to internal customers.  I learned about production work, and I was good at it.  I had strong communication skills as well as great relationship skills.  I was promoted into management two years into my employment with UPS."
good,"Long hours.  Company is very well managed, A lot of metrics involved which will either help you or hurt you along the way."
good,"The day started with the expecting of unloading equipment, then unloading of the trailers that were schedule to be unloaded.The manager was always there to make sure the job was done safely and correctly"
good,"Not your average 9-5, constantly traveling, good benefits."
good,"truly a job that you can become wrapped up in, they will never turn you down to stay before or after to learn a new shift or system. i work with many wonderful people who care for their job and each other.  you truly never know what you're going to get into each day its always the same, but completely different. very political with union and management butting heads a lot and can be very pressing with increasing extra duties but no extra time to accomplish them"
good,"Unloading, sorting, and loading are some employees' duties. High regard is given to insured packages to ensure safety and prevent loss."
good,"Gran empresa pero que se mueve como un elefante , servicio inmejorable pero muy burocratica"
good,learned how to constantly load and upload trucks  everyday i worked in bullfrog packing bags and scanning packages everyday. work over night shift.
good,"busy days delivering packages and a fast paced position. I worked with different drivers that taught me about the business. For example, scanning packages and making sure they go to correct address."
good,"The work culture of UPS is truly a sight to behold. The lower level management in general gets along with the employees, but the higher up the ladder you go, the more they view employees as disposable. The hub manager doesn't care about the employees, and only views them as a tool to use in order to get bonuses. The higher level managers do not care about the health and safety of their employees, instead pushing them to go as fast as possible. And if an employee gets injured trying to maintain that speed, they will be shamed and insulted and blamed. The managers will also try to sneakily take money from employees checks without them noticing."
good,The owner was the best as a person. But i worked too many hours for too little pay and felt unappreciated way too often. I worked 6 days a week all day every day and never had time to do anything in my personal life and i have a 5 year old so that was unacceptable.
good,"Best Buy was a good retail job. Easy to relocate from location to location because of my background working at a store location. Once you're in, you're in."
good,It depends where you apply or hired. All UPS Stores are franchised. So you will get a different experience than others. My experience was very good. The Store I worked in was very flexible.
good,"A typical day work week would performing various audits such as Billing Audits, Invoice Audits, Profitability Audits, and Visibility Audits.  These audits are basically performed to find errors done by various operations groups with the end result, the customer having their shipment(s) moved thru the connecting systems on time with the end result, hopefully, being an invoice with minimal, if any, billing errors.  The purpose of a Profitability Audit is to see whether the services we charge to the customer are more than what the carrier will charge us, UPS Cartage Services."
good,"Its an ok place to work it you need benefits , not the jobs for you if you don't like to get physical and cant handle a crazy work environment"
good,"It is an excellent place to work if you can fit in. Too much stressful and one way communication form of communication. "
good,"A typical day for a store owner / manager."
good,"In a typical day I must solve problems in my work area, while supervising my employees. I have learned a lot of management skills from this position. Also how to be organized and on time with filling out paper work."
good,"it was a a decent place to work at full time. I learned don't ever put fragile on any of your packages, the loaders don't care at all. "
good,"It is okay for a p/t job to go to to school, that is it."
good,I enjoyed the job of delivering packages to customers in the general public.  There is a genuine positive feeling of doing good by others when the shipments reach the customers.  One assuredly acquires the skills necessary to work with many different kinds of people and personalities when working for UPS.  There is a diligent work ethic expected of UPS employees and one most certainly needs to have cultivated that work ethic before working for the company.  The only part of the job that I did not prescribe to was the ongoing tug of war between management and hourly union worker.
good,UPS Is a very faced paced high endurance environment.  The company is strong and majority of the employees have been with the company for many years and it becomes a family.  You have to be a dedicated hard worker to make it.
good,"UPS being a global leader the company itself is great, being a union member as a loader has its perks. The actual day to day management is left to be desired. I feel it needs a revamping."
good,"Busy fast pace environment. If you do something wrong, you are responsible. Coworkers can be friendly and personable."
good,We delivered packages all day. The faster you worked the quicker you could slow down. Customers like their products on time. The Management kept us going with packages.  The guy I worked with was nice and very professional. I loved seeing customers get excited about a package.
good,UPS Freight tries hard to be UPS but does not have the infrastructure to do so.  Mid level management is great and care about the employees while senior management is is more concerned about satisfying the corporate UPS and looses site of where the rubber meets the road.
good,"Great benefits package, tuition assistance, weekly pay, good work/life options. 401 k matching program, stock options with employee purchase discount."
good,Have to stay at a steady working pace. Constantly Lifting over 50-100lbs a physical job. You really work for your money.
good,"A typical day at work is very very fasted paced and very very hot. The people are very nice, its just a physically demanding place."
good,"Fast paced environment, time goes quick. Manual physically demanding work while exposed to elements. Its like working in a garage...when its 20 below or 95 you just deal with it."
good,"A typical day starts at 7:00 AM and ends at 8:00 PM."
good,UPS had a daily physically demanding work pattern. I learned proper ways to lift and lower and important safety techniques for work environments as such. I learned how the delivery and mail system works. Management all depended on individuality. Some managers actually cared about helping workers become better in their work habits and some had poor managerial skills. Co-workers were often labors and had no ambition or motivation so it was strange if good workers like myself had to take on some of their work load.The physical labor and lazy habits of co-workers were the hardest things to get used to.
good,"Mainly we take in packages for the customers to return. We also specialize in notary services which can some time take up the majority of the day when busy. Moving,stacking,and arranging packages throughout the store."
good,"It is hard work. Need a good back.  Get benefits as a part time employee after a time.  Benefits good. No job per motion, raises aren't too bad, set up prior on a time scale."
good,The most difficult job I've ever had. 4 hours a night but its a rough four hours. The inside of the trailers feel like a sauna and the packages never end.
good,"Typical work day was sorting packages on a fast conveyor line to various belts according to its city, state, and zip code for 3-4 hours. Breaks were set to a maximum of 10 minutes, which often times only felt like 5. Working in a dusty warehouse wasn't really a problem, and neither was sorting packages above the specified capacity from time to time, but often times the management team on our area of the hub took advantage of that, forcing co-workers and I to work harder, faster, and sometimes, under hazardous conditions. Grievances were often placed, but little was actually done regarding them. Some of my fellow co-workers had gotten injured, and were still told to work. Usually there will be safety groups outside the hub and force people to sign just to cover themselves so when someone does get hurt, the injured will be blamed for not taking the precautions listed, even though the injured was placed in a dangerous circumstance, like a manager forcing an unloader to unload an excessive amount of packages for the sorter to sort, regardless of the weight."
good,"Part-time works about four hours a day, Monday through Friday. I improved my attention to detail and organizations skills while employed in this position. Co-workers are very energetic and friendly, great attitude to work around."
good,UPS was an okay place to work. The drivers I were assigned to help kind of blew me off and dumped me back off when we werent even done with the days route.
good,"It's a great place to work if you don't want to get paid a lot. I've learned a lot but it was in a sink or swim environment. If you want to go to work, do your job and not get paid very much and then go home, it is totally fine. If you want advancement, training, and compensation for a great job well done, look somewhere else."
good,"I work the morning shift which is usually 4-9am (times sometimes change). The work is challenging due to the physical aspect of the job. The pay is very good for a part time job especially when you start to add years to your  employment. Your co-workers are nice people. The benefits are very good and there is room for advancement within the company"
good,Enjoyed the work I did and the hours I had during the year I had this job. No problems with management or other employees.  Definitely learned to lift with the legs and with the back here. Also this job was my very first experience with having a union type job and I found I didn't find it at all bad; after paying my dues that is.
good,"Its a good part time job for someone who like physical work. You only work 3.5 to 4 hours a night. all you do is load, unload or sort trailers until shift is over"
good,"It was cool until I had to load a truck by myself, I didn't like it but i don't think its a bad job all you do is stack boxes into a truck some are light some are very heavy, I learned how to be thankful for air conditioners because the summer heat was felt in the factory. I was learning how to stock boxes properly and in a timely manner. The supervisors and managers were cool, the co-workers were helpful probably because I was a young lady. The hardest part was dealing with the pace of the boxes that came into the truck, the most enjoyable part of the job was going through training."
good,ups was a cool place to work as a part time. it was like working out and getting paid. the pay rate was good but the hours not so much .
good,"Ups is for the young helps them keep people who need to find a career. If your looking for a career with no degree stay union and go into driving, you can make more,you looking to build into the company and getting a degree and move up in the company go thtrough supervision, make sure your degree is accept at ups because you can move up in no time but dont ever ever ever ever ever get  stuck at part- time supersion. It just a dead-end from there."
good,"I have been with UPS for 7 years I don't have any serious complaints, I just wish that there where more hours and full-time jobs available."
good,As a Driver Helper you will not drive the delivery vehicle but assist the driver in the delivery of packages. Driver Helpers usually meet the UPS driver at a mutually agreed upon time and location each weekday (Monday through Friday) and typically do not work on weekends or selected holidays. Hours vary but usually begin after 8:00 a.m. and end before 8:00 p.m. Driver Helpers must comply with UPS appearance guidelines.
good,A typical workday included using a handheld computer to scan items coming down a conveyor belt. I would scan items to ensure that they belonged in the truck that I was loading. I would then load the truck in a manner to form a perfect and solid wall so as they would not tumble on the way to be delivered on long trips. I was also tasked with unloading trucks and ensuring they were being placed on the correct conveyor belt as to reach their proper destination. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in a fast paced environment and having the responsibly of being placed in a large truck by myself and being tasked with ensuring it was properly being handled.
good,"Early morning work in open warehouse"
good,"United Parcel Service offers it employees and exceptional benefits attraction as well as pay scale.  The company does however have a large amount of room for improvement for treatment of employees and creating a legitimatly safe working environment that is necessary for any labor intensive operation.  I did not have the opportunity to tour other facilities, however what I did witness in our facility was a lack of upper management leadership that demanded procedures related to employee safety and employee rights were followed.  Unfortunately, our center sacrifieced its integrity for production.  Upper management consistantly talked down to other employees using profanity and threats to achieve production."
good,sometimes we leave early so i ended up with only 180 or 170 a week when i only work 20 hours. when we do get to work our full hours and a little extra week pay might be 200 for 27 hours
good,"*Works and instructs over 60 drivers on daily task and dispatch per set route."
good,"A typical day at work would be boring, hot, and sometimes stressful. The hardest part was working hard every night and never feeling like you receive what you should earn. The most enjoyable would be the new  people I got the pleasure to meet there."
good,"Day to day duties well define"
good,"I started working at ups at 19 years old as a loader. A typical day was go in around 5:30 and work till 9:30. It and was a one track mind job were there was not much thinking involved. You just go in and load, sort and go home. I learned a lot about the job that i eventually became an operation supervisor."
good,"The job is great but being in charge of union workers can be a challenge. They all know the system and manipulate it to their benefit. Management maintains the reigns most of the time but its difficult to manage employees when they know they can get away with so much."
good,"The workers and supervisors that work at Ups are sometimes professional but they can be unprofessional at times, that how ever has not interfere with my ability to preform my job. the environment is about work and nothing else"
good,"-Very Fast paced"
good,Hard place to balance work and life. Best way to move up and build seniority is to start working at UPS at at a young age and be patience .
good,"furgone pulito , barba fatta, divisa in ordine e scarpe lucide SEMPRE  erano il biglietto da visita per un servizio impeccabile."
good,"While working at UPS, I was able to see how the company function in a warehouse environment, especially during the most busiest seasons the company deals with. Peak Season was a challenging time but the team got the work done."
good,The job is very challenge.Learn how be very flexible.UPS management do not know how to treat they employee.Have good co-workers we work as a team.Finish work at a decent time to be with family.I enjoy all my customer and meet a lot people.
good,"I ran the air / international operations for ups.  The job required constant learning, testing, and federal certifications as we shipped to 278 nations whose laws and bylines are constantly changing around the globe. Although this job was high pressure being based on an ""on time network"" of planes, trains, and automobiles that was seemingly impossible to accomplish we would complete our tasks at hand and somehow set the standard for other hubs around the nation to follow.  I was proud to be apart of the team that gave Syracuse the number one rate and rank in the nation and helped sustained that spot for many more years to come.  I honestly owe ups credit for the majority of the management and time management technics I use to this day.  Their constant commitment to strive for nothing less than perfection in all aspects of their business from customer service to pioneering new logistics has created a smaller, more manageable world now able to get your letter or parcels from New York to China via super sonic jets in just eight hours if that's what you need.  I would say that over all UPS is one of the most interesting and technologically advanced companies in the world and it was an honor to work and learn under there guidance and regime.  I only left that position to focus on my day job as the GM of a growing company that unfortunately took up to much of my time to work nights anymore. I do miss the ""action"" there from time to time, always an adventure.  I was responsible for crews of 8 to 50 employees depending on the many management roles I played there over the years, everything"
good,"Incredible benefits packages and good pay. The huge down side is that everyone is only part time. For new hires this means every day one hour before the shift start you have to call to find out if you are going to work. During peak everyone works, but the rest of the time a new hire is lucky to work more than a couple of days in a month. Loading operations take place early in the morning and vary depending on amount of projected packages. You must be able to wait it out until you become vested and earn seniority to get more hours. Other than that issue it is a good place work if you can stick it out."
good,"It was not a job for me. I learned to stack boxes, where each box came from and where it was going to ship to. Co-workers were great to be around."
good,"A typical work day at UPS was very labor risk and also fast paced environment. I learned how to sort boxes and stack and load trucks at UPS i also learned how to safely lift boxes and unload trucks."
good,"The co worker and manager are great"
good,"* Repetitive and always doing the same thing"
good,The UPS Store is a great place to work if you love seeing something new every day. Since they are small businesses it is a little harder to be competitive in the pay grade department.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a short meeting concerning operations, then a mass sorting of parcels and loading of trucks. I learned a great deal of mental and physical resilience while employed. Management was sharp with very short patience for poor performance. The most difficult part of the position was the significant increase in load during the peak seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job was being out alone or with a partner in the field to deliver parcels free of supervision."
good,"Great benefits,  stress on performance made place a bit too much to deal with."
good,Come in to work clock-in and report to dock. Place charts with names of trucks behind for labeling. Use trained methods for picking packages from box line. Co-workers are usually younger. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 10 minute breaks. The hardest is maintaining a speed for transferring packages from the box line to its  correct truck.
good,"lift and load packages all day"
good,"My typical day included, but was not limited to, calling on at least 5 to 8 current and prospective customers in my geographical area.  I learned the inside and out of every business and how UPS Freight would be able to service their needs.  My co-workers worked as a team with insights on different businesses and from different cultures.  The hardest part was overcoming repeated service failures, but it was also a great challenge.  I enjoyed seeing how the services that my company provided were able to help grow my customers' business."
good,"I only worked with UPS over the holiday season. It was a very fast paced and physical job. "
good,"hard work, demanding standards are hard to meet.  advancement can be selective"
good,load packages onto flatbed trucks. Learned good safety skills. My supervisors were very helpful and made sure we did the job right.
good,"this work is focus on customer management and territory explore, a typical AE duty would need to manage each account of customer with hold, try to figure their potential and indentify business trend, "
good,If your interested in long hours and a heavy workload this is the place for you.
good,"From training new employees, managing teams of 10-20+ union employees in varying job functions to data entry and analysis in high pressure, time-sensitive situations, working for UPS was one of the most challenging and rewarding jobs I have had."
good,"Difficult workload, but I take pride in saying i work for UPS."
good,"Hours were great and opportunity for great pay was there "
good,"I moved up through the ranks fairly quickly at UPS. One of my greatest assets is my ability to lead and stand out amongst the rest which is why I chose the management route at UPS. However, the reason I left is that it became a lot like the military where we would have a lot more rough days than easy ones no matter if we made our numbers or not. I loved the job and the people but not upper management. My typical day would start out with pre work paperwork such as volume, previous day's accomplishments such as misloads, damages etc. We would then start the sort which I managed my area sups in making sure we kept up with production, stayed safe and monitored any issues that may hinder the operation. The actual sort would only last 5 hours but our days would be double that with pre-sort, sort and post sort activities."
good,Daily work day is filled with planning and meetings as well as reporting. You must be ready to help or support the operation or departments whenever needed. The management team are easy to work with but could be a little stressed out. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of your tasks because there are so many of them. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you can make a difference if you do the job right.
good,"The job is great, its not easy but it does keep you busy. You really have to know that you are there for the opp. not the job itself. You will be required to relocate if you are looking to advance fast. The management is a mixture of good and bad just like anywhere. If you get on the bad side of people you're more likely to have a hard time here. Attendance and Policy are the biggest concerns there. The site likes to pretend that the goals they have set up for you are reasonable however with out ""tricks of the trade"" and inside secrets its pretty impossible to meet the goals. "
good,"Monday - Friday 0400 to 0900"
good,"It is a Union Job that has low pay and high risk of injury. They work you hard but if you produce, management isn't too bad. If you can stand working part time there for about a decade they might hook you up with a nice Drivers job."
good,"A typical day involves first meeting with employees about the previous day's production recap.  I then conduct safety observations and make sure that each employee is following the proper procedures.  I contribute to the growth and profitability of the company by holding my employees responsible for attendance, safety, and productivity.  I am a part time management supervisor who is responsible for 7-10 package handlers.  The hardest part of my job is getting some of employees, who can be difficult, to work as they have been directed.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with a team to accomplish a common goal which is making sure we provide excellent service to the customers in the community by getting their packages to them in a timely and accurate manner."
good,"Typically spend the day packing and shipping packages for customers, which includes creating shipping labels with accurate shipping information for customers. Also serve as a customer mailbox location."
good,"Interesting. Small package centre. Customers are our top priority and our customers expect timely shipment."
good,This is a very good company that has been around fro several years longer than most other companies.  They have very good benefits and good job security.
good,"It's good for young people. Helps keep you in shape, but is very tiring."
good,"Working here is difficult because the work is hard."
good,"On a typical day at work, I check any emails from customers, ""upper"" management, etc. I, then, spend the day supervising my employees, solve logistical problems, advise customers, dispatch next day air packages and/or international packages, follow proper TSA/FAA procedures as well as international rules and regulations, audit hazardous materials, and finally, check my emails one last time for any changes, concerns, or customer cares. I have learned a lot from UPS. I started right out of high school and knew nothing of logistics, dispatch, or the transporting of goods. I enjoyed the job and what I had learned so much, I stayed to get as much experience as I could. I have learned a lot about logistics concerning the complexity of transporting domestically as well as internationally. I have learned a great deal of dispatching and transportation. Most importantly, I have learned a lot about managing an area and solving complex problems in complex situations. I have met some of the best managers at UPS. Some have taught me the importance of not giving up as well as taking charge of situations. My co-workers can be the best part of the job. When somebody is transferred or leaves the company, it is like losing a friend. The hardest part of the job is figuring out problems that are sometimes beyond my control and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning so much and building skills that not only are a benefit to my future as well as outside of UPS."
good,I worked at the Kansas City KS hub down in the West Bottoms for 6 years while going thru school. This is a job where good employees are punished and bad ones are rewarded. By this I mean that good employees are given higher work loads and poor ones light loads but both are given the same time to do the work. If an employee can't meet a quota they are moved to an easier job completely by passing those who have more seniority and have been on a waiting list for those jobs to open up. This particular hub likes to play the management shuffle and switch managers and employees around without regard to employees rights under the rules. Management will overlook these rules to improve productivity but are quick to punish employees if they break them to meet the quotas. The benefits are the only reason people stay. High turnover rate.
good,Physically demanding job.  Must put time in before making any decent money and have benefits
good,The envirnment was made by your co-workers.  UPS management was one of the worst I have ever worked for though.  I personally felt as if they were trying to hold me back so it was almost impossible to advance within the company.
good,low pay for hard labor. Unloaded trucks and safety manager was a 300 pound overweight gentlemen.
good,"i work at most 4 hours a day unloading trucks , i've learn to work as a team and the management is really great i dont feel talked down to or anything and my co-worker are a friendly bunch i never felt out of place but the amount of work thats done i dont feel like im being compensated enough. i love the job but i cant live on only this job"
good,"Ups motto is that they have done for decades this way, why change. If you don't mind working for a company whose culture is this way, go for it."
good,The culture at UPS is very hard nosed and a process driven environment.  It is only suitable to the toughest work ethics.
good,A typical day at work would be very busy unloading heavy boxes off the belt. Had to dress for the weather. Some days hot some days cold but i like working outside. I learned how to build a wall of boxes inside a trailer. Management was very good. They liked me from the first day because I'm a  hard worker so they started moving me around to help out with other trailers that got behind on  their work. I have no problem with being a team player. That makes work easier. My co-workers were very friendly they taught me the ropes the first day. The hardest part of the job is managing your truck and having to help out with others but i understand not everyone will be as quick as me. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and working as a team to accomplish one goal.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of constant lifting an movements, I learned how to load a truck properly along with using a scanner with handset. Supervisors focused on employees well being and productivity, co-workers were friendly an helpful. There really was not a hard part about the job because there was always help, the most enjoyable part was when everything was ready which helped workflow and the day go by quicker an easier"
good,Obtain all the materials needed so that my employees have the right materials they need to get their job completed. Obtain the numbers so that i can review the results of the last day of work. Interact with the employees pushing them to always have a safe work environment by either stretching before the shift starts or work very safely while the shifts on.
good,"UPS taught me how to emphasize getting the job done efficiently and safely. In a typical days shift you either load, sort, or unload packages. These environments are usually uncomfortable, and morale becomes a major maintenance job, with employees tiring out or becoming frustrated due to excessive amounts of volume (boxes by the hundred). Most employees at UPS end up with injuries to their lower lumbar region, and many injuries elsewhere."
good,"A day at work as a loader was to scan in into the system. Scan Packages into the apporiate trailer. If the package doesn't belong it is taken on and put on a cart until the end of the night. Loaded boxex and bags to the top of the celing so the wall of boxes won't fall or tumble on anyone. When the truck is filled up call it in, and go to another trailer until a new one comes."
good,"Even though UPS is a part-time job, its a very hard and physical job. There was a lot of heavy lifting involved, and your just moving on your feet all the time, breaking a jams on the rollers and slides, then going back into the trailer and start loading again, and when your done with trailer you have to put all the heavy stuff (bulk) in the trailer, and the supervisors are always rushing you to work fast. then when your done you just go on to the next trailer and start all over. a good day at work would be when there was no heavy flow coming down the slides and rollers so you wouldn't have to stop loading the trailer and break the jams. and also if there wasn't a lot of bulk to load in the trailer and if the supervisor wasn't yelling to go faster."
good,"My work at UPS is very challenging, and no two days are exactly alike. As UPS continues to evolve, the demands have become greater."
good,A typical day at work would consist of stretching before work and unloading or sorting up to 5 or 6 trucks a shift I have learned many safety procedures i have also learned to sort various packages to their zip codes. The hardest part of the job is getting the job done in a timely fashion while still using safety procedures.
good,"Come into work at designated time and bag small packages at a high volume rate."
good,I have learned a lot and to be organized and tracing packages throughout the trucking zone of the UPS Maspeth department.
good,"	Managing $8 million book of business and generated $600,000 of new business in 2012"
good,"The job itself is demanding, but you learn to deal with the everyday struggles due to support from your co-workers.  There can be days, however, when you leave extremely frustrated or angry due to unnecessary safety rules or under staffing."
good,"Got along with co-workers, they were all around the same age. I learned job safety. The hardest part of the job had to be my first days, just learning about how to do my job. A typical day at work at UPS was fast paced."
good,Hard long work day each day is like a week fast pace learning new things are great good exercise because of the physical aspect of it working around co workers is horrible no team work trust loyalty its just hard waking up knowing you have to go to that job everyday for pennies on a dollar. It's nothing enjoyable about this job.If you are a kid coming out of school you may consider it but other then that I have moved on.
good,"Get a union job and you will be set in the long run."
good,"I loaded multiple delivery trucks over night. Schedules varied but normal start times were between 2 and 3 am and last until 11 or 12pm. Management would review daily stats for loading and, for the most part, stayed on top of the employees in their designated areas. Packages you load are coming off of a conveyor belt that rarely stops so you must be alert and work smart. This job is actually a great way to start and work your way up in this company but it did not work well with my college schedule and ultimately this was the reason I resigned and found another."
good,keep work loading to put truck and good fitting like exercise as teamwork
good,"* Safety "
good,"I've been with the company for about 6 years now and I love the benefits but that's about it, management isn't all on the same page, very loud in there with all the belts and conveyors. Don't wear anything you wouldn't want oil and belt rub on.  Stay hydrated with water always, Don't expect to have vacation during Thanksgiving or Christmas, you will not get it, that is our busiest time of the year where you'd be getting 20-30hrs a week which would mean overtime most days."
good,"Working at Ups was a good kind of job, you'd work your five hours and go home same routine about 20 hours a week. the supervisors were nice but strict,understandable with all the work that needed to be done and my co-workers were amazing always had fun with them made the job entertaining, the hardest part would have to be when the package volume is up and you're held responsible for maintaining three trucks + bulk with only one ten minute break. But the most enjoyable part of the job was that it felt like a second family the unity in the workplace made it not much of a problem, you had help when needed people friends to talk with and the pay wasnt too bad"
good,I worked in Mesquite at the UPS hub and learned many entry level skills in management. Me staying there for about 4 years also helped and allowed me to move forward with my career. While I was there I encountered many situations that I had never engaged in and improved on my experience with each one. The turn over rate while I was there towards the end was horrible and caused me to quickly accept better employment elsewhere. But otherwise my time there was well earned and met many different types of men there from different backgrounds. (Women are in most part only hired for small labor jobs within the hub so production numbers do not suffer). My advice put in about 2 years of supervisor experience and cash in on it even without a degree. Your experience is your degree my friend! You the expectations are hit and miss because it is based on a team of people who guess what they think should be processed that day. As a part time supervisor you will often find yourself do the work of a full time which would not be as bad if you were fairly compensated for it!
good,"A typical day for me was to supervise 25 employees to ensure that all of the workload was completed in the time that is allowed.  "
good,Though physical work. Management is always on your back. Supervisors are pretty cool. Co workers are easy to get long with.
good,"A typical day at work would be very productive as long as I am there. If I was out a day which was 1-2 days a year. Cost per piece would be high and jobs would not be done properly. The employee's I managed were wonderful. The above me management, I trained for my job as well myself. I started out a team member to a team lead then to my final position Supervisor."
good,You work hard everyday to make sure packages get on the truck and  are delivered to our customers.
good,"I help as a seasonal helper for December.  It was the hardest time of the year.  Every day was like an adventure.  New neighborhood, different weather.  I help the drivers deliver the packages.  We would run to houses drop off the packages drive down the road and do it again.  It was fun and exciting.  The hardest part of the job it actually snowed were i was.  I didn't have gloves on any my hands were very cold.  I got along with ever driver.  They were great people."
good,Only thing I can say is that i would have thought UPS could have been much more organized.
good,Overall UPS is a great place to build for the future but the job is parttime. The senority they have for prior workers sometimes leaves you without any time on the clock. If you start young at an early age you should have a great chance for promotion in the organization.
good,"My typical day at UPS was very busy from start to finish. I had a good relationship with the drivers, they would say my smile brightened their day. I was a team player and would stay over to help if someone didn't show up or if there were a high volume of calls. You know how it can go with an office full of women so I minded my own business. I did like that we were rewarded for doing an outstanding job whether it was receiving a plaque, buying us lunch or picking an item out of the UPS catalog."
good,"Great entry level management position to prepare you for high stress, goal oriented workplace. I have learned how to manage employees under high demands for performance. The hardest part of the job is the culture at work. There is very little promotion opportunities in operations. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the hourly employees that work for me."
good,"Inbound and outbound call center"
good,This was probably the worst job I have ever had. We loaded semi-trucks by hand. Its really bad on your back if your not loading correctly. All the supervisors did was yell. It was not an enjoyable place to work at.
good,typical day was spent loading trucks sucks during holidays because you will get tons of boxes that you will have to load onto the truck
good,it was pure manual labor but could keep you in shape. It was part time shifts only in a warehouse enviroment. However they had good benefits and coworkers looked out for one another. They also helped with college.
good,"UPS Capital Business Credit is situated in Turkey as a representative office. It means there are a lot of restrictions by countries commercial laws and the headquarter. Therefore, there are plenty of things that employees have to do. For example, we couldn't advertise our bank in Turkey. The only way to introduce ourselves was calling or mailing the customers one by one."
good,There have recently been a lot of changes to UPS which some have found favorable and others unfavorable.  It depends on what you are looking for.  Compensation is middle market and advancement can be somewhat political.
good,"Reviewed invoices and worked with both central and local dispatch offices to assist in managing load schedules. Responded to Customer inquiries relating to rate quotes, appointments and other issues. Performed data entry keying bills from manifests."
good,"Clock in, log into my assigned forklift, attend the safety meeting, and go to the dock shack and get a trailer to break, until work is done. I learned how to operate a forklift accurately and safely. My co-workers are awesome their always there for help and better advice about the job. Management is horrible, they treat employees like they are worthless. The most enjoyable thing is having a job."
good,"Job security is a plus but after 18 years of being part time, I need more than that."
good,"My typical day consisted of arriving, working hard with my co workers as well as having fun and getting our job done.  The management was good while they helped us as well as led us.  the hardest part of the job was the hours, I would work till about 3 but was able to get through with the help of others."
good,"In the seven years I've been there, I've acquired a useful set of skills, that cover computer software knowledge as well as improving my typing skills. You are required to do a lot of bending and lifting, and your productivity is reliant on a group effort. The hardest part of the job is, the amount of time to get stuff done in. Or lack there of. It being a part time job is definitely crippling to the wallet. It's a good job if you don't mind the minimal hours, and the working conditions weather wise."
good,"My typical day at UPS would greet everyone, get the mail bins set up and scan packages.  I learned how the company operated, management was fair, I managed to get along with my co-workers, the job was not that hard but the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I did a good job to the best of my ability."
good,temp job did not last long management good co-workers good hardest part long hours
good,"delivering between 75 and 90 stops a day but traffic, bulk deliveries not taken into account and some parcels were 50+ kilos no help to get of van"
good,"Each days task was to make sure that parcells were going to the correct destination. To complete this, there was a lot of backups to get through and testing of employees to be done. Learned what really hard work was and how to deal with it. Management was very tough to deal with and some of the union workers were also difficult to handle. Hardest part of the job was the pressure that you were under from management and union employees along with the huge amount of parcells that would overwhelm your area. the best part of the job was that you can meet some interesting and enjoyable people."
good,UPS is willing to pay for college while you work overnight.  It is a fairly basic job and allows time for studies.
good,I load packages in a semi trailer. I learned that it is a extremely fast paced job. The management was good. My co-workers were very nice people. The speed was the hardest. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time.
good,"Decent place to work. The people I work around are friendly. Mismanaged by some of the fulltime management team. Makes it frustrating to get things done correctly, and efficiently."
good,Loading aircraft in a safe-timely manner. With knowledge of how to prevent slips and falls. The knowledge how to properly lift and load packages. The knowledge of machine operators on the ramp.
good,"Being in management at this company can be very frustrating. They are a large stable company, where benefits are excellent and career potential for long-term union employees is unsurpassed. Also, training and accountability in operations are unparalled. However, advancement decisions are not consistent. Qualified candidates for management promotions are supposed to be the most experienced, educated, and successful employees. This is not always the case, though. Favoritism outweighs performance and qualifications in many instances. Upper management controls the careers of subordinates and can exercise absolute veto of an employee desiring to rise up the ranks. Additionally, operations managment too often is a dead end, with career development only given lip service."
good,"Early mornings don't work well with full time student. It was easy at first, but after a while it gets tough, especially if you want a social life."
good,I worked here while attending school. The tuition reimbursement helped out my bills for school a lot.
good,Strategic Account Management and active business development of new Enterprise level customers.
good,"My day at UPS was on the phone. I would track lost parcels, or schedule pick ups for clients and business. I would also process clients account payments."
good,"Very fast paced. Great benefits for a part time position."
good,"*walk in at 11pm"
good,"Good company overall, hard work is a must, a typical day at work here is very tiring and hard, the co-workers here are okay, some people are nice and some aren't. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expected numbers in whatever job you were doing. The best part of the job was the sense of accomplishment when you were done working for the day."
good,"UPS geeft je als werknemer de mogelijkheid om je persoonlijk te ontwikkelen en verantwoordelijkheid te nemen voor je werk."
good,A good place to start developing myself in the workforce. It was an after college job that turned into a career. I have gained an abundance of knowledge and skills during my time here at UPS.
good,"Arrive to work get Check at the Medal Detector. Find your station and start scanning and loading the trailer as the boxes roll down the belt. Build a strong wall so it doesn't tip as the truck leaves. Management is cool, they don't breath down your back 24/7. Co-workers are nice. I have made many friends from working at UPS. The Hardest part was keeping a quick steady pace when you get hit hard with a lot of boxes at one time with the expectation to maintain a strong wall. The most enjoyable part of my job was compilation of a trailer."
good,"*Flexible work hours "
good,"I only work in the ""metro"" section so I cant give a full review. I work from 6pm-9pm. There isnt much to learn. Just be aware of any packages that contain hazardous materials. You rarely come across your co-workers so 70% of the time you're alone. That may not be for you but I dont really mind it. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain a fast pace as unloading 20+ trucks is a physically demanding task. The rewarding part is seeing every truck in your lane completely empty at the end of your shift. At this point you get to recover a bit before you leave."
good,I worked very hard in my time at UPS to earn a promotion only to be treated very poorly after I was promoted. I was given employees to train that didn't care about working hard and that made it very difficult to properly train them. Management did not help with this at all and was primarily concerned with offering criticism that was not constructive. 
good,Fine place to work if you like repetion and you  can be a self motivator. 
good,Loading and unloading delivery trucks at a fast paste. Learning more about dangerous and hazardous material.
good,"A typical work day can be very busy, depending on the work area and job duties. Co-workers are great. They are fun and energetic. The hardest part of the job would have to be loading the packages. Especially in the older buildings. The opportunity for advancement is great. Ups has a job for anybody and everybody. "
good,"Benefits and vacation were top notch for part time work"
good,"Work at UPS is very busy, constant traveling and difficult to get time off when working as a driver. Very spontaneous with the job assignments."
good,"13 years of employment and no full time work."
good,"Good benefits, working hours, employees.  It is a diversified company with lots of advancement opportunities."
good,UPS is a very challenging but rewarding place to work as a manager due primarily to the hours spent at work. I gained many leadership experiences and overcame many challenges due to the environment. 
good,"UPS is an excellent company to start your career. However, for experienced professionals the growth path is very slow. Very strong performers should expect promotion to take at least 4-5 years at each level."
good,"a typical day at work consist of heavy lifting for the duration of the work period, i learned a lot about how ups works, and shipping packages. from manager to coworker everyone is friendly, hardest part of the job is the exhaustion of over working every night, best part is the break"
good,"The atmosphere is very light and the staff is very friendly. You pretty much have to make sure you are doing what you are suposed to because there isn't anyone constantly watching over your shoulder. That being said, I learned how to manage my time and work pace accordingly. The hardest part of the job is that out of all the hours of being on your feet you only have a 10 min. break, therefore its difficult to endure the physical fatigue after so many shifts. The most enjoyable part of working there is making 8.50 and hour not including the multiple opportunities to make bonus."
good,"Typical day starts with a meeting at 8:45am, on the road by 9am and delivering the next day air packages by 10am, Once that is completed, I start delivering appoximately 300 packages/day at about 100 places along the set route. This includes 2 10min breaks and then 1 hour for lunch. Typical day lasting an average of 10-11hrs/day."
good,"journée de travail chargée mais très instructive, les opportunités beaucoup de développement sur les secteurs, management difficile mais avec beaucoup de persévérance j'obtient toujours ce que je veux, bon clients et exigeants. Aspect difficile milieu d'homme, aspect agréable travail dynamique et toujours avec beaucoup d'imprévue."
good,"Very demanding, and hard to work with but great for people in school"
good,"the healthcare at ups was great, you get a good workout there to"
good,This job was a good transition from the military to the civilian workforce. I enjoyed receiving recognition for a job well done. My customer service and problem solving skills were greatly improved. I have maintained a great mutual respect towards my superiors. No problem with my supervisors or managers. I have many friends who still work there. The hardest part of this job was my need to do more for the customer than required. The most enjoyable was the satisfaction of a job well done and great co-workers.
good,it was a part-time job so honetsly wasnt for me or anyone that has bills to pay
good,"I hated working night shift, and my managers some time were rude because of it."
good,"I report to work at 3:00 am until 8:00 am depend on the volume each day. Pre setup the hub with containers to be loader with packages going to different CSP's to be loaded on tractor trailors going to different UPS hubs. Wait on air craft to come into assigned ramp. Unload containers driving a tug pulling a dollie. Cover in areas when co workers are out or volume is high and they need help. Report to PCM each day for management to let us know what time the air crafts will arrive. What is the game plan for the day and accept assignments. Report to management any damage packages, spills or any unsafe equipment or devices that are being used during our daily operation. the hardest part of the job is getting empty containers off racks that weigh 375 lbs to 975 lb in the rain or when it is windy trying to put it on a dollie by myself. The most enloyable part of the job is when it is finished and I can go work on our safety workbook and prepare for the annual audit for the ramp and the hub."
good,>Typical day.. Never boring. Maintaining safety and work/Osha requirments. End of day results/Logistics. Managing employees to make sure the job gets done.
good,delivering lots of mail each day...frequent stops...fast pace
good,"The position is part time, in the off season days go by fast."
good,"Overall, UPS is a good place to work. Upper management varies, in the aspect of working with lower management in regards to productivity/advancement. UPS offers a great comprehensive benefits package, which includes a college tuition reimbursement program."
good,"A Typical Day At Work At UPS For Me Would Be To Arrive 15 Min Early Then And Wait For My Driver And The Truck To Be Loaded Up. Then After My Driver Would Arrive We Would Hit The Road. Depending On Your Driver And His Designated Area Is Where Your Route Was Determined. I Learned How To Work Through Extreme Conditions It Was Just My Luck That I Got Hired Around The Time Of Hurricane Sandy, But I Was So Determined To Work I Didn't Mind. My Driver Was Really Nice He Knew I Was New To The Job And Didn't Put Much Pressure On Me To Get Everything Right Away, I Was Relieved Cause I Really Didn't Want To Mess Up. The Hardest Part Of The Job Was Maneuvering Through Extreme Weather With All Those Packages But I Dealt With It. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was The Fact That I Was Always Moving And Interacting With Many Different People Through Out My Day And That I Was Mostly Outside I Really Enjoyed That It Made The Days Go By Really Fast. I Also Met The Actor Mark Wahlberg At One Of His Personal Homes."
good,"A typical day of work for me would be loading trucks during my 3 hours , checking labels properly, not loading damaged items,stacking boxes nice and neatly. I learned that ups is a very hardworking company which will require you also to work as hard as any other employee putting forth your best effort.The hardest part of the job would be when packages are consistently flowing which leads to an overflow which means more work ,moving faster to avoid such a huge mess overall It was a challenge in which challenges are something I enjoy doing. The most enjoyable part of working would be recieving recognition for your hard and dedicated work."
good,Very fast paced environment and hard work. You must be very quick at sorting parcel and nicely load it in the truck.In summer it is very hard work because of no air conditions in the trailers.
good,A day started as I would leave school and arrive at work and assisting guests.
good,"I worked for UPS for 7 years and for the most part liked the people I worked with. I found the harder I worked the more work they would give you, while others around me were able to stand around and chat. The management had a knack for bringing in silly little changes that did nothing to help you do the job better and in turn only added obstacles to doing the job."
good,A great place to work if you are the single income earner. Its a hard job at times with all of the time commitments and weather problems that affect driving.
good,You have to prove yourself to be a productive person its a very high paced enviroment with a well thought out system its a pretty pleasant place to work
good,"Speed and accuracy drives this company. In order for customers to have a reliable service it is a requirement that the workers work fast and accurate. Safety is another aspect of UPS which I had seen was important. The safety officers would make routine checks and question you on your knowledge of the safety procedures. Working on the day shift, a typical day would start somewhere between 11:00a.m. to 12.00p.m and end somewhere around 5.00 p.m. or a little later depending on the work load. Providing public transportation to the UPS location was also convenient, along with the reduced cost of the bus ticket. My co-workers had years of experience and were willing to share there techniques on how to work fast and avoid errors. The hardest part of the job for me was the standing up and sometimes lifting heavy bags. The most enjoyable was the only 15 mins. break that we got."
good,"My time there was an enlightening one. My first venture into a large scale operation of a company. I was thrown head first into pawing at packages for a meager pay check, poorly advised on proper clothing I was suffering from overheating and improper body heat ventilation. During my years there I learned, I progressed, I excelled. Gaining friendships and the favor from my superiors. I gained stamina and an understanding of what you put in during a term of employment; you receive in kind."
good,This company was great.. Union work at it's finest. Enjoyed working with company. Alot of room for advancement.
good,Learned how to lift heavy loads in a safe manner. Everyday meeting about safety. Given credits for safety handling of packages.
good,"Llegada a la empresa y hay que hacer tu ruta, checar garantias y checar que los paquetes fueran de tu área y preregistrarlos en el DIAD."
good,I learned alot from UPS especially how to become a valued member of a team and a leader.
good,"Arrive at work early and start working through my work task checkoff list. I check the previous days performance and try to see where I can improve with my dispatching and determine how the least best delivery driver can improve his performance. One of the most important disciplines I have learned is how to look at a vast amount of reports and pull together a plan to make improve costs for the day. In other words ""getting the big picture"" by making the most money by cutting costs through cutting hours and miles. The hardest part of the job is coming up with the plan and executing it with the reduction goals set for us. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you make the goal and save the company money."
good,"Ups had great hours, great benefits, and competitive pay. It is a great place to work especially if you have tough skin. The drivers are mostly nice and so are the other employees in the office. The only problems I had were bad attitudes given to me from some of the management and drivers. Other then that it was an overall great experience."
good,"It was good for me, felt like I got a workout everyday that I worked. Broadened my geography, it was fun to learn all of the different towns and citites in the U.S."
good,"Interact with Our customer, Team mates, Supervisor and Management on a daily basis."
good,"A job i would recommend for kids fresh out of high school.You get worked hard and with very lil pay, but everybody starts somewhere."
good,A typical day at work is very strenous at times. You have to be mentally and physically ready for the tasts at hand. My co-workers and bosses are very friendly and easy to get along with which makes for a good work ennvironment due to the conditons that I work under. The most exciting part of my job are the people that I work with.
good,Sorting through different addresses and finding where they go . Loading different size trailers
good,very great experience was my first job when i moved to north carolina great employees and mangement
good,"Take inbound phone calls from Package Center support and Sales Resource personnel. Manage service failure resolutions, billing inquiries, tracking of shipments, procurement and public relations with customers."
good,i worked on the dock loading and unloading trucks. this company expects a lot for little. the management was not the greatest. the hours were poor and too far
good,Lots of Pressure. To demanding and no recognition. The Co-worker care only about themselve. There is no team work. But there was freedom throughout the sort.
good,"Clocking in go straight to work loading trucks, always made sure there was no spaces in between boxes.My manager my friendly and understanding.My co-workers were nice and good helpers.The hardest part of my job was quick and making sure packages was laid down right (at the same time). The enjoyable part was my co-workers they made it fun to come to work."
good,"sort,lifted,packaged scannned parcels according to the zip code sorting scale,loaded parcels on trucks"
good,I was told by our boss i was the fastest and best sorter they have.
good,Calm but fast paced days co workers were laid back the hardest part of the job was waking up so early at 4 in the morning
good,A Job that u have to compete with other to succeed in the position. Good benefits and a great life balance.
good,A good place to work and I liked working with the customers face to face
good,"Depending on where you work and what you do, you may love the job, or you may hate it. The benefits are awesome, but 3rd shift is a pain and management can sometimes be a headache."
good,"It is all about safety and getting packages to where they need to go and satisfying the bosses with the numbers. Great benefits and people. Work schedule is not too flexible. Job security is good as long as you don't lie, cheat or steal. Dealing with some of the union workers can be a pain. It is work work work and trying to get everything done in your a lotted time but pays the bills."
good,"there was little supervision presence during the work day, because of the great new-hire training was so great. great opportunities to cross train in other departments. and great leadership experience."
good,"This company offers competetive pay rates, great discount incentives and provides a positive work enviroment for their employees"
good,It is very fast paced and a difficult job. Definitely need to be in shape. Benefits are good. Pay rate could be better.
good,"UPS rarely turns anyone away, so it is an ideal job for students seeking a part-time job. It is a very labor intensive job and is located quite far away from most campuses. However, if anyone is in need of a quick job fix, there are very few that are better."
good,"Managed and trained staff on Night shift, warehouse environment, fast paste, Multitasking, working with a diverse group of individuals. Worked in ex-stream cold and hot conditions."
good,"Hard to get hours when starting, poor pay, but well managed and opportunity for advancment. Every shift is a great workout if you like that."
good,Unloading trucks of packages from other distribution centers. The job was hard but was good for keeping you in shape if no time for a gym membership. pay is ok takes awhile to get a raise.
good,"when i was with UPS we really concentrated a lot on safety,i served as a new hire trainer as well as doing safety compliances"
good,"Everyone has heard about the culture and expectations. It depends on where and who you work for. I was in regional/ local operations and support functions, and worked with more progressive managers. In some center operations, the old-school mentality was still evident."
good,"While there is plenty of room for advancement in this company, I found that the middle managers lacked ethics. They were quick to lie and cheat their way to get results, but would not take responsibility for their actions. I couldn't wait to get out of this company."
good,"Hard, heavy work with limited timed break. Short shift hours. Management was pleasant and encouraging but not enough to increase hours or pay scale. I have left."
good,"UPS will hire you to work for peak season, after Christmas and New year there will be no work and you will sit at home for months with no income. In generaL working with UPS is great."
good,"It’s a good job, but there is no room for advancement. It takes extremely long to promote. If the company would offer more hours instead of minimal hours the company would be amazing. Has part of the safety community the company focus heavenly on safety."
good,"I love working for UPS my only complaint is they cut hours way more this year 2019/2020 than they did in 2018 and it sucks. We have less workers, shorter days with heavier flow so we need more workers."
good,It was good for the benefit but management wasn’t helpful  plus you have to always look at your check and hours to make sure they match. They will over work you. You get like 4 or 5 trucks and you only suppose to have 2.
good,This is a great job if you’re in college and need to make up hours on off periods. Benefits and higher pay would be more sustainable in today’s world. During my years I’ve experience a lot of change with incentives and I believe they have gone downhill.
good,"If you want benefits, work here.  Plus if you like or have other jobs the work times give you more flexibility.  don't plan on doing anything else but working at UPS in December."
good,They have plenty of great benefits for many different things. They make sure you have all the tools you need while working. Also they take their job very seriously.
good,"You're paid well, however you earn your salary via graft. No time for shirkers, time management is crucial. Physical Fitness essential."
good,I loved ups to but it was very hard with the package loading the trucks in doing all of that but everything was really great I was getting paid 15 dollars a hour
good,I Loved My Job my Driver's and Co workers. Management was always changing. And I was not able to advance or change positions for the entire 2&1/2 years I was there.
good,This is a fast-paced environment in which you can receive benefits as a part time employee. The hours allow for the possibility of having a different job or to be a stay at home parent.
good,I been working for ups freight now a total of 10 year's are company bought buy them. I originally worked for overnite transportation. I'm a switcher in the yard. And I'm on third shift and it's easy work for me i've been doing a long time. Management is a joke. And new hire's won't get the full rates until 5 year's.
good,"Pick season is insane, long shift hours and long day. Over time is not paid for the managers and supervisors. Supervisors between them don't help each other and employees are arrogant, and hard to manager because of the syndicat pressure. "
good,I didn’t know when I was working until the morning of and they gave me minimal hours to keep me from quitting. The days I got good hours I enjoyed working there but there was no guarantee of anything and I have not heard back from them after they said they would call me.
good,"I worked for them for 3 weeks and got plenty of hours, but they do mandatory direct deposit in addition too having there pay stubs only available online, they shorted me 4 dollars on pay the entire time I worked there, After they informed that I wouldn't have too worry about getting shorted."
good,Communication is one of the important part of an organization but if its lack then the company is not really doing well.Though the company is good generally
good,HR is little to no help. Job is well paying and flexible. Management seems to be hard to work with at times. I had a good experience with my full timer supervisor.
good,"UPS was not my favorite job, but the pay was good. It was painful for my body , specifically my back, because I have Scoliosis. Team work wasn’t really there, but the benefits are amazing."
good,Management isnt very good they were very rude and condescending unwilling to hear what you have to say or care. Other then that pay was awesome hours werent great but part time and was always busy on the move.
good,If you wanna make sum easy money and get a work out at that same time. This is the place to be. Great benefits and people who work there. I learned a great work ethic
good,"its a good job and great company just be prepared to work a lot of long days and hard work, minimal work breaks but willing to work with employees. a lot of repetitive movements"
good,"The job isn’t an easy job, as expected it’s fast paced and physically taxing , the hours change from time to time making it inconvenient sometimes but for the most part it’s a decent job"
good,"If you cant pick up anything heavy, this probably isnt the place to work. You have to also make sure to pick packages up carefully. Terrible work environment overall though because it's an open warehouse because of the trailer doors."
good,It was a cold winter but the work wasn't hard and they train you for it. If I was to work there again I would apply for a driving position because they have good benefits.
good,Ups was a great seasonal job for what its worth but the work was very hard and its nonstop intense during the holidays at the end you will get your overtime just at the cost of your back
good,Its a great place to earn a little extra money as a 2nd job or a job for a grade school student. Great benefits. Before and after peak season typical hours are 17-19 hours a week.
good,A typical day at work consist of coming into work on time each and every day ready for work with a great attitude. What I’ve learned from this job is the ability to have patience and a great amount of self control being that I come across different people everyday for the most partit’s a big work place.
good,"Job is enjoyable depending on the team around you, some days are very stressful and some are very laid back. Different scenarios on different days even though the job is the same each day, all depends on how busy."
good,It's an easy job to get. All u do is load packages into the trailers an keep the flow at a steady pace. Sometimes u may get rushed with packages but help will be there an it won't be do hard after thr first week it gets better by the day.
good,Basically for about 4-5 hours a night depending on what job you get assigned you go to the truck they assign you and unload a whole lot of boxes and put them on the conveyer belt i learned that ups is one of the most tiring jobs out there all the bosses were cool when i was there the hardest part was having to bring the 75+ pound boxes to the outside of the truck n down the belt
good,"I work better when I know I’m getting something worth while for the hard labor. UPS was a new, clean environment that just required me to physically be in motion for long periods of time."
good,Ups was more of a work out than a job. They pay 14 a hour but only give yu 3-4 of work and if yu take the bus you’ll be waiting 2 hours for the bus waste of time but good benefits
good,UPS is a great company to work for with benefits and paid time off. You should take note that you won’t get enough hours starting out which is a bummer. Working conditions are rough and they’re main focus is you not getting hurt.
good,"This job was good in a pinch, hours were sometimes low depending on work load. The work itself wasn't hard. It would be good as a secondary supplement job,  or for a student."
good,Everybody I went to high school with that didn't move away works there and that's what I didn't like. When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's bad.
good,"I worked 3 and a half to 4 hours 5 days a week. I originally had a 150$ bonus, but within 2 months they cut the bonuses in half and my hours came from almost 30 hours a week to less than 20... i was at UPS for 3 months and the fast changes were significantly harmful to my life as I already struggled to pay rent and other bills. And even when i took the sunday shift and worked overtime, my checks just werent enough."
good,"Overall the job performance is above average, but some of the supervisors are not on the up in up. They don't talk to you as a employ but try to treat you like a child. Im over 50 and I feel that the upper management is great but lower management needs to learn better people skills. Don't want to name, names but the gutter is not straight it's got bends. So overall the company is great."
good,"Not a bad place to work as preload, just have to be able to deal with fast paced work and a bit of stress with how much you have to deal with. The main reason most people work here still is because of the early hours (work normally start around 4am) and the benefits which there a good amount of."
good,"Typical work day includes stressful unloading all fast paced. "
good,I feel like they should make the loading conditions better. Inside the trailers on any given day its 15 degrees higher than the outside temperature.  Can be unbearable.
good,Nice crew members to help if you need it . just harsh work conditions sometimes when things get behind though . If there was more order & structure here I would’ve stayed.
good,Well I only been their a couple of months and I'm still learning as I work their but I must say it's hard work and a fast pace work flow understanding change s in a work shift
good,"hard work, not very much recognition. just a lot of hard work. I learned at this job that there is a lot of room to advance. But it is not a very happy place at all."
good,"UPS pretends to care for their employees, but all they care about is their bottom line.  Everything is numbers based.  If you're not a performer, you are treated differently.  There is ZERO work-life balance; and if you are a driver, do not ever expect to be home before 7pm ever again.  If you are a supervisor or manager, you will work 70 hours a week, and you don't go home until your drivers go home.  It's a union environment, so don't expect days off or vacation until you are high enough in seniority too earn this."
good,"Salaries are not competitive. Opportunities for advancement are great but again, salaries are much lower than competitors. Management can improve. Great benefits."
good,"Stressful, have to rely and trust the preloader that packages are in the right spot, constantly on the look out for traffic hazards, bad work to life ratio"
good,"While UPS provides good wages, union health benefits, training and advancement., it is partial to those who are permanent full-time employees. To become a permanent full-time employee  takes a long process based on seniority and hours worked. There is also a high turnover amongst the immediate dock supervisors team which can be uncomfortable for those in part time position's"
good,"I enjoyed my time working here in the MDM department, while at times there was enough work it was very fast pace. They also don't communicate with their temporary employees. But over all it's a good place to work while learning new soft wear programs."
good,start off the day with our morning PCM. discuss delivery goals and safety. load remaining parcels on truck. account for time sensitive packages. do a pre trip of vehicle.head out to delivery route.
good,UPS is a fast moving environment that never stops.  Hard work allows you to grow.  It is very demanding and ever changing.  Every day new challenges arise that must be handles in an instant.  Work family balance can difficult.
good,No part time job can help adults stay with the company. The full timers should be able to make worthy upsers full time way before the years allowed. The hours are not sufficient enough. It attracts kids. Adults cant stick it out unless you're living 3 to 4 adults sharing bills. Highly unlikely
good,"Management treats and talks to employees like slaves unless you are a favorite employee.. Supervisors at this location LOVE to feel Superior therefore they will yell and talk down on their workers. They make us feel like garbage, like they are too high class for us laborers. However UPS has a great  pay rate and the benefits are fantastic."
good,UPS on a typical day is really hot and very hard work from the jump and about time it is to go you are ready to go to bed and get mentally ready for the next day to produce the same effort and to work hard everyday.
good,"treated like a number "
good,UPS works the h*ll  out of their employees but they don’t give enough hours. I didn’t mind the fast pace environment but I hated the hours. I would drive from Modesto to lathrop 5 days a week only working 4 if I’m lucky 5.5 hour days.. but other than that I guess it was cool
good,This job was seasonal for Christmas holiday with no guarantee steady job but was ok to get some money if you not got another job it is big company but they not pay enough.
good,Orders have to be fulfilled during that given day or employees stay until orders are completed. This includes all departments in the warehouse. Overtime is mandatory which could be unfair at times. But it is outlined in the interview and hiring process.
good,"Very fast paced job. Willing to teach you and work with you if you need help. Very friendly and nice management team, the management team really works around your schedule if needed."
good,High work pressure with limited system advantages. Systems are not Upgradetade with new technology which can be easier to work fast and to get done work more with efficiency.
good,"Fast paced an very hot. Not enough breaks and management is very unorganized. Once Yu become a full time driver everything gets better, good money and benefits."
good,"Face paced work environment, great pay and benefits. Multiple shifts to meet any schedule. Tons of room for advancement. Great place to work, worldwide company."
good,"My co-workers were great. The compensation was not in line with the job requirements. I would have stayed if there was better pay. Having to quickly make it to a customers door in the heat and the rain and cold wind was not an easy task, especially if you are trying to move fast so you can empty your truck. I would not come back as a seasonal employee with the low pay rate $10 an hour."
good,"Great worker, very dependable, can troubleshoot about any problems, enjoy working and fixing on things, always willing to learn and ask questions about things I don’t know about"
good,While i Worked it was always cold and freezing but because it was a fast paced work environment you quickly warm up. Unloading boxes off the trailer trucks onto the conveyer belt just  to be put onto individual trucks to be sent off and delivered.
good,The driver helper position is a seasonal thing around the holidays where you basically drop packages off on peoples door while youre driver takes you to the houses. The pay is decent and the work is manageable.
good,If your looking for a part time job and willing to work hard and before the sun comes up then UPS is a good job to consider. A descent pay and few hours plus benefits outweigh the hard work. It does interfere with grade school having to leave around 8 or 9 AM.
good,"When I initially worked there it was under different ownership, and it was amazing, under the new ownership, it’s pretty decent, and I became a notary."
good,Even though I made good money where I lived. I would work 11 hour days almost Monday-Friday with an occasional mandatory Saturday. leaving not much time to spend with my family.
good,UPS was my second truck driving job overall it was decent. There were times the dispatchers didnt communicate and had me on 2 loads at the same time. My driver manager was the worst never drove a truck in her life and had advice how to drive a truck a college degree doesnt give you truck know.
good,Been working here for 2 months now as a package loader. Most physically demanding job I've ever done. Work doesnt stop until the end. Water is a necessity!  Working at Ups will make you lose weight. I hope your supervisor is cool or you're in for a ride. This job will take a toll on your back. Lift with your legs as much as possible
good,"Working 8 or more hours a day"
good,"I have expansion of experience in the field of working in Assembly ,Warehousing and Rewarehousing, also with unloading and loading trucks, forklifting, customer service greeting guests, being reliable, hardworking dedicated to work, out-going person etc always willing give Extra hand."
good,"The money and tuition reimbursement are just a few of the amazing benefits ups has , you get paid weekly and you have the weekend off no matter what shift you pick, They also have a convenient overnight shift which is great for students and new parents  . So that's the amazing part about it . However the conditions are insane . In the summer the heat is enough to make you pass out and your constantly rushing people and being rushed . The environment is extremely hostile . You are treated and forced to treat people like a slave to crunch numbers . It will teach you what your made of ."
good,"well compensated and enjoyed my co-workers, too bad it was only seasonal I really would have liked to become full time but just be prepared to work until late at night sometimes!"
good,To put it short. the interview process was great i went in what i applied for (driving Position). They sent me to Driving School I passed. I came back and started driving. Once it got slow they didn't have a driving position for me so they wanted to put me in the warehouse for 3x less hours 3x less pay 3x more work. It wasn't what i applied for.
good,"It's a high school job in a nutshell. And some folks take it a little far. At the end of the day. you don't really care if your co workers are better then you. You still get paid and go home. Most folks will go to night shift, but will quit dues to how crazy it can get. If you want to make a lot of money then you keep working for them for most of your life, as you will get raises every six months. (I think.) And if you want to become a truck driver. Then you are going to have to wait a long time then. The company will also try their best to be cheap as possible, there a lot more I can say but it's more of a ""you got to work to see it."" but it's a job that can pay if you want to hard for it."
good,"Minus the occasional power trips from upper management, lack of communication, and work practices that is contrary to SOP, UPS can be a fairly enjoyable place to work"
good,"Ups is a great company with many benefits, the only down side is when you're just starting out because the pay is not enough to live off of. But other than that, great company and job security."
good,Very physically demanding and honestly not enough pay for how much work you have to do. Only work about 4 hours a night if your lucky. But you have to bust your butt the whole time you’re there with really no breaks at all.
good,"constant moving, made day go faster, learned about the different products being packed and shipped out, not enough cooling support for summer time, overall was ok"
good,"They fired me because i couldn't become a driver because of my eyes, so they were supposed to cover my doctor bill and i called multiple times and they still sent it to collections"
good,Very fast paced and high in demand to move packages quickly. Everyone worked together and hard to get the trucks unloaded. Managers were great and stayed on top of things.
good,This job was kind of fun at first but as time went on it got more and more boring. Management likes to discipline new people for things long time workers do almost daily.
good,"Working for the company of UPS is no easy task. It is extremely fast pace and the working condition can be difficult at times. Overall my experience has not been the best but I do believe UPS has given me tools and skills that I will be able to use at any other company i choose to work at. Some skills like communication, learning new system mechanics, daily implementation and demonstration of safe and proper work methods to ensure employee safety, and understanding the overall logistics of the company."
good,It takes a while to get use to the work load but it manageable you might want to guit but don't the money is worth it and you might meet some good co-workers.
good,"UPS is a job where you are expected to be able to work hard and fast while under terrible upper management. The only good things about it is that you are in a union and that your fellow co-workers are also dealing with the same stuff as you, which allows you to bond and work together well with your team. Depending on where you work, you are also expected to work outside no matter what the weather is short of a tornado. This company never has days in which it's closed due to severe weather and you are always expected to show up to work unless you are injured or on military leave."
good,You must be willing to work constantly but great benefits. Workers are nice and this is a team job. You can move up to become a driver too. Starting off working in the mornings. Make sure you are on time
good,"Working peak season was rough. Otherwise was a physical labor job making walls of boxes. Good entry level job with a lot of benefits an the backing of a major union, The teamsters."
good,This was my first warehouse job. This job was the definition of hard work. Fast paced. The management was indescribable and a little confusing. They just push you out there and don't really tell you what to do. Good warehouse experience. Great coworkers. The co workers were helpful
good,"They company pays for your school, and their health benefits are really good.  The work is labor intense usually, if you stick with it you will end up with a good pension."
good,"I worked at UPS briefly as a seasonal worker for the heavy-duty holiday season, the work was fast and depending on your driver it was quite enjoyable."
good,"Management was strict very and every rule was followed to the letter."
good,good steady work come in lift boxes and get paid at the end of the week. work is hard if youre not used to lifitng any over 70lbs but its a nice stable job
good,"I could make myself happy working there, but I was a seasonal hire. I am sorry I did not make the cut. I found union work the same as non-union work..."
good,"Day and Twi-light has great worth ethics and everyone works together to get the job done. I believe if the hours work for you. This job will be a great. Holidays are mandatory on the weekends. Peaks season starts the Friday after Thanksgiving. Have to work every saturday and sunday until Christmas. Now they changing about certain holidays, may have to start working all holidays. Dispatchers dispatch loads to drivers making sure they have all their credential before leaving the building. Overtime is available. Hours don't change once u are set on a sort."
good,this job is 5 hours a day. it pays good and iwould recommend it for college kids cause its pays well. most of the position require a little muscle if you know what I mean.
good,Fun to work in the truck and drive through areas. Can be physically demanding at times depending on the route. Dealing with customer and delivering heavy packages are the hardest parts of the jobs.
good,Ups is a solid company to work for.  You are treated fairly as long as you pay attention and provide your skills and work ethic in a professional and most of all a safe manner. Perfect for college students to try the working world if you have second thoughts about full time student options. In fast and out fast with job security and some financial help in hand. Work and safety is what counts and employee work speed can always catch up.
good,"Pretty decent job to get by. Weekly pay so that's good. The job does have benefits , however I did not quickly indulge in wanting all the benefits in the world even though they do pay for schooling. I like that I could have fun while at work you do get a chance to hang out with friends and to communicate so that's a plus. I like the job , so far."
good,"Working at UPS was an experience none the less. Working in conditions like that is not ideal for anyone, i feel like the management play favoritism when it comes to overtime rather then choosing those who actually work hard."
good,Unload tractor trailers. Load brown trucks. Cold in winter and hot in summer. Any hours over 5 per day was overtime. Early morning start times and off by 9 most days.
good,Ups is a fast pace work place and they take safety very serious its a place to work if you looking for a career benefits are good as well and they help you with school.
good,The work is hard and it is a fast pace. The employees are great people and they make it a nice place even though the work is stressful at times. Management could use some improvements with communication.
good,"Fast paced enviroment. As long as you work with urgency ,you will not have a problem keeping up with workflow. Pay attention to detail and be a team player. The benefits are great. I just wanted the pay compensation to increase."
good,Ups is a great company to work for. There are few pros and cons to this company. Management is great while the type of work you have to do for the pay is horrible
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at UPS. However, the position I held was only offered as part-time which didn't work out for me financially. Also, they offered good training for the job via online work modules."
good,I honestly like UPS I was fresh out of high school I needed money in my pockets co workers was cool management was cool never was really a problem you was able to bring your phone inside and listen to music. Only thing I can say is that pay wasn’t so good $10.50 an hour and you’d only work maybe 4 hours you’d be lucky to work 6 hours but it’s not a liveable wage.
good,"When I first got hired on it wasn't to bad. However, as time went on work days were lengthened to 12hrs with little warning. Management was good for the most part. The work is very remedial and boring. However, I moved around plenty because of networking and got put on one of the higher up jobs as a forklift operator. As a result of this, work was more entertaining but the days were still long and communication between stations was lacking, and I didn't receive a raise for my new position. Ultimately I left because I hated the long hours and wanted to go to college."
good,"I learned how to supervise a group of people, keep them motivated, "
good,It’s not bad if you don’t have a social life. You get paid to work out but they do offer discounts to gym memberships. It’s hot in the summer time and cold in the winter.  You can get overtime pretty much whenever you want
good,I went from a conventional hub to an automated hub. It was a big difference but we have meetings everyday to help adjust to the new changes within the company
good,"•	Unloads mail from trucks & handles and sacks empty equipment."
good,"UPS is a good company to work for if you're seeking good benefits and pay. However, you may run into people with ego and retaliation problems from time to time."
good,Barely had any breaks worked the whole time with 15 minute breaks and i learned how to work the conveyor belts and lift boxes correctly and learned what to do when its something hazardous
good,UPS does wonderful for its employees ability to be promoted within a company. UPS pushes a lot of production on its part time employees and should hire more people to get the job complete.
good,"A typical day at work would start with a safety meeting and the previous nights numbers. Then we would start up the sort. The night would consist of managing employees to make sure they are following correct job methods. Also, when needed management would jump in and help load or unload packages to make sure we made service on all packages. The workplace culture is very fast paced and hectic. I learned how to be able to manage up to 30 employees at once without becoming frustrated. I also learned how to make my own decisions and how to fix problems without upper management help.The hardest part of the job was definitely the super fast pace of the job. However  I enjoyed the fast pace of the job and staying busy this was probably my favorite part."
good,"My day went a little different than the average day for most people at UPS. I was the only guy in the factory who knew how to do every position despite my short time being there. So I did whatever was needed for the day, if someone called off, they could always rely on me to do their job. However, if everyone was there, I would usually process the international packages and then at some point, the floor manager would tell me where he needed me when they were done. Sometimes it was helping the new guys load trucks, sometimes it was unloading trucks, and sometimes it was going upstairs to package the small packages."
good,"If you can get in with a degree as an intern and be given a Full Time job, you should do it that way. "
good,"A typical day at work entailed, meeting your driver on the route, packing and delivering packages straight to customer properties via hand trucks. "
good,"What more can I say, we're understaffed and the union hasn't settled a contract so we're earning the exact same pay as we were a year ago, and until then we're just stuck waiting and working."
good,Very good place to work at if you have a second job to go with it and it also has very good benefits and has a great union to back you up but only 10-15 hours starting out.
good,"I have been currently working here for almost 1 and a half years now. It's a great place to work, hours are perfect for part time, and the money isn't too bad either! I work with some pretty decent people, but at the same time like every other job you'll get people that'll tread on your every last nerve. But with this job, you've gotta have thick skin. You'll either be doing one task for a few weeks, or do something completely different; so it's not the same day every day as there's always new challenges to get around."
good,The job wasn't difficult just the management was bad. Was easy work most days great benefits and insurance  but not enough hours and hourly wages. If they had better hours and wages I would have stayed
good,"got good benefits."
good,Hard work and early hours benefits free can be very hard and tiring early morning shift hours can be hard to get used to rising that early but they have a night shift
good,"If you stay safe, arrive on time and not get caught been unproductive you will do fine. Plus, do not steal and show courtesy to the packages. Other than that you will do well."
good,"It is a very high energy you are constantly moving,lifting and working. I have learned a lot at this company. It taught me to become a better worker, it also taught me to be more diligent."
good,"VERY Long hours.  Great pay.  Its basically a trade-off.  I worked in operations management, it is the toughest department in the company.  Union environment makes things difficult at times.  Numerous tasks assigned daily, high goals to meet.  Integrity tested at times."
good,"the working hours are short as a loader/unload and the work is manageable but can get very busy at times depending on the time of the year. heavy lifting is common, but eventually it all comes down to the people you are working with and your manager that can make your job enjoyable"
good,the view on UPS is that is was alright when i was i really don't know anything else about them at this point but what i can remember it was a fun work place
good,"As a Supervisor, held.before sort start, a brief meeting is held. During this meeting the buildings goal/plan is given to us. Each area Supervisor is given it's specific plan to execute, at a specific end time, making production."
good,"training classes "
good,"Fast paced, hard work. Coworkers are usually nice but management usually doesn't know what's going on. Its hard to work for a company that doesn't appreciate you at all!!"
good,Ehh it’s benefits are the attention getter but as far as one on one learning and ability to set/create goals to achieve for possible promotions... that’s non existent. Too much going on for upper management to take notice. If you are into coasting then this Job is perfect.
good,"Short hours for decent pay but not enough to live off. almost feels hectic on the floor every day. good people and good managment though, and i feel as if i would have stayed longer if i liked it just little better, or more importantly got payed more."
good,5 hour long work days for the most part. hours may change to be longer. Hardest part of the job is the fast moving pace and the amount of trucks each person must load.
good,Very labor intensive a lot pushing and pulling and rotating lifting up boxes. It is a sweat shop. I’d like to work out and stay fit this job is for you. Good place to work your way up if you show up everyday and put in quality effort.
good,"Loading trucks. 10 trucks to a bay (PD) - average 300-400 boxes per hour at 1lb to 125lbs. Co Workers and Management are very nice, Pay is reasonable, there's just not enough hours given to part-time to make ends meet. I will stay part-time for the benefits and subsidize with a full time job elsewhere."
good,"Near Slave driver mentality. Constantly attempting to squeeze blood from turnips."
good,It was a fast paced environment that always kept you on your toes and actively doing something in the building whether that was unloading or loading cars or cleaning the building or trucks
good,Ups is a very good environment on time schedule good reputation to be around non the less the best to be if you want a warehouse job keep in mind to be on time and in the proper dressed code
good,"Good pay and benefits"
good,"Had a good time working here, managers and employees were always fun to work with, felt like I could confide in people there if need be, pay sucks at first, but give it a year and for a part time job great."
good,"Has its pros and cons like everywhere else. Overall excellent benefits but poor union representation. Job is easy but management and ""profit' based :("
good,This was demanding job but enjoyed the work. Only reason I left was the daily travel that was difficult. I would return if given the opportunity. Solid company.
good,"They did not pay us nearly enough for the amount of stress that went into that job. I worked in a factory during the winter, and an overnight shift, so it was extremely loud, cold, depressing, and stressful."
good,"Some supervisor (one) are rude, but most of the staff are friendly. Most of the drivers are easy going and very helpful when they come in  the morning with help loading left over packages"
good,UPS is a great company to have under your belt if you are a driver or in Full Time Management over the years. You can learn a ton about logistics. UPS is not for people who want to be in PT-Management. You have to pay for benefits. UPS is beneficial to union employee as they are 100% covered. Great place for learning to use your networking skills to reach certain goals you may want to achieve.
good,Completing advance reporting. I love detail data and identifying solutions using data warehouse. Working with a group and knowing you were all working for the goal insure the growth of the company.
good,Entering work preparing work area after a meeting then giving employees proper equipment to work supersvising them during the day and moving them to where the work is while using managerial accounting very phsyical
good,"ups work u to the bone if you get hurt tell every one soon as u can because if u tell supervisor & manger it may not be reported."
good,"A typical work day at UPS is lots of lifting and moving packages."
good,was hard but rewarding work. I worked long days but felt accomplished at the end of them. Teamwork was cool too just I've had an overwhelming feeling that it was really a boy's club. Oh and seniority rules here in package delivery land.
good,This was a good part time job you learn a  lot. the hard part of this job is working when it is really hot outside. I will recommend this job to someone that love to work out because here there is a lot of lifting and pulling.
good,"A typical day for me was coming in for local sort at 5:00 P.M. and working a 5 hour shift Monday through Friday.  At the facility I work at local sort is composed of only around 10 people. Most of the people have been there upwards of 5-20 years so gaining seniority is very difficult. The wait time for becoming a driver is somewhere between 1-4 years and depends on many different factors. PEAK is the only time your able to make any decent money as a package handler since you can get an hour or two of overtime occasionally, and can jump with drivers making 15.00 an hour. The only enjoyable part about working for UPS is the benefits, and its a decent resume builder. I did every job in the building from sorting smalls, unloading, loading, airs, scanning, washing package cars, and more."
good,Nice and fast paced place to work ! Learn a lot about business and peolpe . The managers really help you get the hang of it and try to take omcare of you as best as they can while still pushing you to work harder
good,I have enjoyed my time with UPS. Their new employee training for part time workers is structured and sets folks up for success.  They believe in developing their people and hiring from within. They expect a lot and seem to have poor work life balance. I think I am as high as I want to go because I want a life out of work.
good,Very fast paced place to work. Days can be very long. The overall salary and benefits excellent. The treatment of employees leaves much to be desired.
good,"Long hours and hard work, but good pay, and benefits. Would recommend to someone who needs a steady income but must have flexiable hours and be willing to wait for a good work schedule"
good,I couldn’t work at ups as a career job you barely get a set schedule they send you home when you want the bus stop running at a certain time around that way it’s just a lot of cons that’s come with the job
good,"sign in, receive scanner, belt and assigned truck. unload all night. u will receive a 10 min break. the workplace is serious, you can get hurt but they have training in place. My job was unloading so there is a lot of bending and lifting. At the time we worked in an older building, they have since built a new facility. Pay checks are the most rewarding, along with free health benefits after a year of employment."
good,"UPS was a good place to start a career."
good,"This job is very busy, strenuous and fast pace.  Delivering packages to residential and commercial establishments.  It involves organization, lifting bending and lots of walking.  No matter what the weather was you still had to deliver the packages."
good,If you think you would like to make a career of UPS be sure you come prepared to work with maximum effort everyday. Even the supervisors leave sweating.
good,Rewarded for work put in. Everyone has the opportunity to move up positions but based on work effort and seniority. Hours vary based on part-time position.
good,"expect to work in all conditions and unsafe work environments at a fast pace, other than that its an ok job if you don't mind the low pay, the raise are a good incentive for the long run"
good,I am still working here in probation so have long way to go. I have learn here many stuffs regarding safety and this help me to avoid injury at work. People work here as a team what i really appreciate.
good,"Overall it has great benefits. However, its very busy. It's not stop lifting of packages anywhere from 1-100 lbs. The management has horrible communication issues. Things fall apart quickly in the sort isle due to lack of motivation on everyone's part to work effectively."
good,"My position was great, the job was great overall but the environment was awful. Newark UPS  is manager office was like a little shoe box, Winter time it was freezing, No heat in the room. My peers, co worker I shared this room with were so unprofessional.. Management was anything but fair, here I am a new Pt supervisor and for going on 2 months I did not have any credentials, log in, badge, nothing. HR was bad.. I am unsure if it was because I was part time and flex so it was as if I barely existed, until they needed me to do there reports or something else for them... Unruly all around, I got more respect from customers and drivers, other than my fellow co workers or managers. Also I cant help but to think maybe I got bad vibes from the ladies I worked with because I did my job so well, and I was the youngest in the room... I enjoyed doing my job, helping the drivers especially around the holidays"
good,"Usual 4-5 hour work day, move the product as it comes to you as quickly and safely as you can. Management and job culture are lacking. The work is not hard in and of itself, however the buildings and overall environment is depressing, moreso during dayshift. Workplace culture is wholly focused on safety, and attempts to engage through ""edutainment"". Hardest part was peak season, 12 hour days with large spans on no activity, then large spans of non-stop movement. The pay and benefits are amazing, however."
good,"Workload is unrealistic with the time given to do it, extreme temperatures at times, and management is awful at communication. Otherwise it's a menially easy job with fun people."
good,Moyenne culture d'entreprise pour les personnes avec des handicaps.
good,A very demanding job physically.  Benefits are great.  Long term work leads to injury.  The major drawbacks are disrespectful supervisors along with biases at time.  They are not fair.
good,"UPS is a good place to work for steady work and you know that they will stay around.  The work is challenging but can be rewarding; however, there are some issues with work / life balance and unfair management practices."
good,Good place to work if you can handle the peak seasons and Low to start. For benefits for your family stock options and discounts.  The pace can be fast and nonstop at times but the culture always allows for plenty a help things get too busy. Weekly paychecks timely raises and room for advancement in my opinion make this a great place to work and a great place to start a career. Management can be a bit poor at times but the union can help you work out any problems or difficulties you may have on the job.
good,"UPS a starts off as an okay at best job with some benefits provided once you've gotten past your first 30 days. the company is more about one's long term investment giving good benefits and discounts to those  who stay for longer periods of time. but getting to those long term benefits may be challenging depending on the type of worker you are. however that does not mean worker harder and be reward greater. because if you going into this workplace trying to stand out you'll find more work being piled onto you because you're ""dependable"". quickly you'll find yourself burnt out before your first pay increase, meanwhile; workers doing the exact minimum to get by have nothing to worry about."
good,This job is very physical with the amount of packages you have to unload and process in a timely manner. Part timers only get 10 minute breaks. Pay doesn't match the cost of living in Chicago.
good,"the whole job is just moving a package from inside a trailer onto a conveyor belt; that's pretty much all there is to it. packages ranged from less than a pound and up to 151, although it was rare to see anything that heavy."
good,"the employment and benefits are great, but you need to be able to consistently lift 40 lbs or over to match a minimum of 400 packages /hr for the loading position. if you can manage that then youre in a good place"
good,"Forget it...  You are assigned to a certain shift and that is where you will stay.  They will not work with your school schedule.  Your school schedule revolves around them.  I learned the hard way and had to resign, I thought that they were better that how they treated me.  You can also forget taking a temporary leave of absence because of a class scheduling conflict.  You either work for them on their schedule or you don't work for them and they will hire someone else take your place."
good,I really didn’t like the job location it was too far from my destination.It was 35 min away and lots of times it’s traffic cause me to be late for.Also causing lackin of rest walkin up I. The morning
good,Not a bad place to work during college because of the tuition reimbursement program. Easy job and decent hours. Structured environment with a lot of young people.
good,"You will be worked like a slave for 5+ hours with not enough pay or long enough breaks. Although some of the management seems to know how to operate properly, most people in the company do not."
good,"lack of hours, no other full time positions besides , management, , and a full time driver. Part-time employees should be able to apply for a article 22 just like drivers can."
good,UPS was a hard working job. I hadn't been working that long before i started UPS but it was hard work. You have to be ready and have the strength and energy to knock out the job.
good,learned a lot in a short time.  freedom to learn and work with help from co-workers when needed.  Co-workers and management ready to answer questions and give insight about company and procedures.
good,"If you don't mind fast paced work, this is the place to work. You get paid really well and benefits are really good as well. But if you don't fit the standards they will put in jobs that only get a few hours a day."
good,i have differently learn alote it alote to take in but once you got it all down you good. it is a place to grow. if you have things to do in the daytime can easy do them
good,"Typical day would be to check your emails and voicemail. Then get started on your call stack. A lot of times the work can be very boring while other times it can be really stressful with customers. Overall I personally enjoyed management there and my co-workers were very nice. Overall the job was ok, it's pretty much collections and sometimes would have to deal some customer service issues. I will say it is much better to work here rather than the warehouse!"
good,"Never even got to work kore than a full 4 hours because there “wasn’t enough work”, but the employees and most management are great and lovely people."
good,Good place of just not what I planed out to be what I expected at first but overall it’s a nice place for a start if your into that kind of work and thing like that
good,"Work was fair, co workers are helpful and respectful. Do as told be on time and listen and you would be treated fairly. Late nights and early morning so you have to be focused."
good,"This job is a physical and fast paced job, working in small sort on the twilight shift. Great benefits with this company. This is a part time position"
good,Hard working and fast paced and not enough pay for the amount of effort and work done. Wear and tear on the body comes on fast and exhaustion with the hours I worked.
good,"Very fast paced and physically demanding, required to lift heavy items, management was very professional, co-workers were very helpful, a typical day at work required loading UPS trucks with all packages in chronological order."
good,"Job wasnt all that great but it has its days. I wouldn’t really pick that job again unless i was given a supervisor job. My coworkers were good people,just wish some of my supervisors were the same way."
good,Fine experience enjoy the employees learned a lot gained my notoriety love the boss just time to move on from this job and find something I can progress in
good,"pros: good benefits paid training work uniform no drug test equal opportunity free transportation  "
good,"The ups job was extremely stressful the job was tiring "
good,"It's a union job, it has good benefits, but it kills you. Nevermind working in sweltering heat or in an icebox depending on the time of year, you get used to that, but what you don't get used to is the slow and painful drain on your body. You have to be moving constantly there, and often at a fast pace to keep up with the packages, which range from 1 pound all the way up to 120. If you ever decide to work in a package hub, you're likely to end up working nights parttime."
good,"This was my first job and boy did it teach me the meaning of ""Hard Work.""I've never worked so hard in the middle of the night then this place.Overall if you do your part you can advance however expect long backbreaking (literaly my back was killing me) nights of loading/unloading just about anything you can think of into four-five large trucks by yourself."
good,It is just that. Driven harder and harder with no incentives. Pay and hours are less than ideal. Yelled at several times and treated badly. Told to treat others bad.
good,"yes the name speaks for its self but working in a warhorse, i feel they should have gave more hours. i worked monday - friday but nothing more than 20 hours"
good,"When its hot its super hot when its cold its super cold. "
good,"First I arrive to work an hour early to start the building up and make sure all the equipment is working properly. The area that I supervise controls the flow of the building, so I have to make sure the belts stay on and everything is sorted correctly. During the work day I also do observations of the employees and test them on the safety features of the building. Ive noticed the culture of the day depends on the stress level of reaching our time to get the drivers out. I believe the most difficult part of the job is not having enough staffing so I find myself getting spread thin."
good,"I enjoyed my schedule, and the people that I worked with. I learned the dispatch role at this company. Fast paced. This was a Monday thru Friday night."
good,"great place to work for. college programs where you can receive your degree, and more. discounts on products. can make a good living working for UPS. friendly atomesphere"
good,Not enough pay for the that is work done it is fast paced but it has good benefits but the supervisors are trying to get work done. They do not care about you that much
good,"This job is very strenuous and requires a lot of lifting ,lowering and, bending. Wonderful ways to advance in the company and proceed in schooling and, outstanding medical insurance."
good,"Very high intensity warehouse. Management and union stewards are constantly in conflict, it seems. If you can wait out a year as regular employee the benefits are very good."
good,very good benefits...would be there today if they wouldn't have closed the doors in Port Huron.  Great team work.  Great place to learn about the business.
good,Ups is a temporary job for quick money if you ever need a couple dollars in your pocket and for different start times and positions this would be the perfect second job.
good,"To be honest the working hours is bad and the paid is very low. The break is very short. The supervisors are nice, however the co-workers are no so nice, especially to a trainee"
good,I answered the phone to track packages. I input information for lost packages to be found and redelivered.  Looked up the amount for packages to have express or overnight delivery.
good,"They paid my full college tuition and have fantastic benefits. They have never ending space to keep moving up, in management or as a driver. If this interests you, it’s a great place to work."
good,UPS has great benefits but the management is not that good. We work hard and have little pay. I feel like if you work that hard you should be rewarded.
good,"Old school with lack of good system. Able to learn different products."
good,Being a package handler was good for those who like to have a work out; It benefits those who like to have their daily exercise and get paid to do it.
good,It’s a great place to work if you are just looking for a part time job. If you want advancement that’s more on the supervisor side than going full time.
good,coming in early for me job so i dont have to catch up with work. focused on getting the job done at good pace and staying safe.  can do every job at the center but i am the Yards-man. nothing hard about this job unless you are in management.
good,great place to go if you want to be compensated well. Great pay and top notch benefits. If you have a full-time job it can get very tiresome. That is what led to my exit along with the the tedious relationship between union and management employees.
good,If the proper training isnt applied them you will not.only have a harder time packimg a truck but.it may also tale a.toll on your.body. I feel.as if that as phyisically demanding the job was that the pay cut in the end was not worth it
good,There were times I enjoyed time I had spent at UPS and other times I was very stressful and demanding on your body physically. One of the positives aspect they proved is their benefits package.
good,"I was a dock worker and would organize the boxes by label as they came down the conveyor belt. It was fast paced but really not that hard. You get to choose which shift you are in,(most likely) i chose 1st and was from 3am-9am quick and easy. but it always dragged"
good,"10  Minute break. On slow days the people who got hired last will be sent home first, working during peak season (November-January) is a major pain but you get a weekly bonus of anywhere from 75-150 dollars per week for showing up on time every day of that week."
good,The job as a pre loader is fun but intense. On busy days you would be loading at least 2-3 trucks by yourself. The people were friendly there and the management was very nice / helpful. They were aggressive sometimes but only to motivate everyone to work hard and to keep moving forward.
good,The job is not physically easy. But if you can stick it out and live on peanuts for a couple years it eventually becomes an amazing career with substantial benefits. Just don't become a manager.
good,"very early morning start time"
good,"Good job with great pay and benefits.  401k, health, dental, vision and plenty of paid time off.  Stressful environment due to the nature of the job.  Could be worse."
good,worked at a few different locations on various sorts learned a ton. Was disappointed when I started to trend towards upper management and the culture that exist among the upper level managers.
good,"Good job for college students. The work is difficult, but rewarding. Most positions require you to work as an union employee, but management positions are available."
good,You will work hard at UPS. Often shifts start at brutal times (anywhere between midnight to 5 am) and your work will be constant movement on your feet and lifting and loading of packages in the hundreds to thousands. You will lose weight doing this job if you stick with it. Management is often given limited resources and so their frustrations sometimes land on you but if you work hard and can keep your cool under stress then you'll usually be left to your own devices. Once you have a rhythm in place the job becomes a lot easier and you'll feel confident even during chaotic workdays.
good,"While it was a great place to work if your no stranger to hard work and toughing it out, but there was this atmosphere of ""I'm with the union I can't get fired so why should I have to work hard when I can just do the minimum and not worry about the repercussions of not showing up for work. This is what I witnessed while I worked here for 3 years."
good,"While working in the warehouse, one is expected to prepare for the changing temperatures in the weather as well as the changing tempos of the work flow. Managers and representatives do their best to make the working conditions enjoyable as the repetitive nature of the assembly line tasks may seem mundane."
good,"Chaque entreprise est un client potentiel, de ce fait, l'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste a été de découvrir les besoins des clients et des prospects, tous différents les uns des autres, pour répondre de la meilleure des façons à leurs attentes. Il a fallut s'adapter à des secteurs différents, des types d'entreprises différents, aux activités  différentes."
good,"good place to work, learned to work smart not hard, hardest part of job is lifting, and the most enjoyable part is exercise. The management is good at what they do."
good,I wish they provided employees a full time schedule. I need more hours. the hours are very early making it hard to do things outside of work because I am tired when I get out
good,safety meeting  hours location instructions needed for daily tasks crew support certain projects materials time limit priorties as instructed daily as given .
good,After a while it’s a pretty good job if u stick it out a first it was a bit challenging but after you get past the first year or so then the benefits tend to make it better
good,"Always on the go, you must be ready to start at all times. Being paid to workout and work in a safe and efficient manner. Very lively and multicultural environment."
good,"With my time at UPS I had a great experience. I would recommend this company to someone younger who intends on moving up. The benefits are the highlights of this company, compared to other companies in Louisville."
good,"(Driver Assistant for the holidays) Would spend the entire day sitting or carrying a package to a stop. My driver was a great fella I got along with nicely. The position is simple but VERY physically demanding. Otherwise, pays well, and is satisfying when a day is complete."
good,i was in college and worked 230am-9am and was going to take me 7yrs to become a driver full time. the people that work there are not friendly at times
good,A known joke is U.P.S stands for under paid slave. I've been here long enough to get paid decently for the amount of hours I put in but it certainly is not easy money.
good,I am a busy family man. They are very understandable when it comes to me having to make adjustments to my schedule. Have not had any major issues since i started working there.
good,This job is for you if you like/dont mind hard physical labor. The union is good. the environment is divided between old timers and new employees- but the old timers are leaving and theirs enough new hires to feel safe. If you want to get into management all you have to do is tell a supervisor and work hard for two weeks. Easy as that.
good,"i report to work unload and get told what trucks i am supposed to unload usually with at least one other person. i was told to always report any leaking packages to my boss after finding it,"
good,"you won't be working too many hours, unless you are a driver. they value seniority over the hard working people who may request more working hours. if you are not a driver, you have no chance for overtime. warehouse workers do the most work, and they don't expect you to take any breaks."
good,Ups is great job when it comes to pay but management is terrible . They dont value employees time but they do pay well and its easy to move . just wish manegent was better at treating employees
good,"UPS is a good part time job for any hard working person.  The full time positions are management and drivers, etc.  Part time doesn't pay well enough for how physically hard the fast paced job is,"
good,"Working at UPS is not a easy job, especially with what hours you end up working in. There will be a lot of lifting and putting down, moving around. It very tiring I'll admit. Yet some people are good at that, manual labor. And if you are the type that can't seem to get one of those every day jobs at stores, offices, etc. and need money, UPS can help you. It also gives you benefits and helps with school if need be. It's a great workplace but it is hard. It all depends how bad you want it."
good,"Impossible to succeed in an industry that demands more output but can not keep up technologically do to Union restrictions. Companies like Amazon and internet sales in general are making the parcel industry almost impossible to keep up with that  work. While companies like Amazon and Fedex can go more automated to keep up with demands, UPS is restricted with Union contracts. The amount of work the company expects from part time employees with minimum wage and no incentives makes the turnover rate the highest in the industry."
good,"If you think of this place as more of a gym or place to exercise, you will love this job.  As long as you follow the UPS approved safety methods, you will become physically fit."
good,"UPS offered great benefits and good pay, but was a very stressful working environment."
good,The unload/load part of the job isn't the worse part of the job. The worst part is how badly upper management treated employees. They used fear as a way of motivation. It takes a year for the benefits to start. From what I heard they have great health insurance. In the long run I feel like you have to work there for about 1 year to enjoy things.
good,"In this kinda job you'll need a lot of energy, have to know how to multitask, and be responsible. It is hard job that requires a lot of effort and focused. I would work there again seen i liked the challenge."
good,"Working nights wasn't so bad at first, until you would have an unusually long night and be stuck there until 6 in the morning. Not coming in until 11pm was alright, but it gets hard if you like to spend your day time busy. You do lose most of your morning unless you sleep right before work. Typically, I was off by 3:30 or 4 am, after working a good 4:30-5 hours. There were lots of bonuses for the seasonal time and many opportunities to work double shifts. Being outside on the ramp was cold, but I found it very enjoyable. You sit around and wait with your crew in a van until your plane arrives, then you unload it and wait until another plane needs to be unloaded or loaded. Some nights you may have lots of down time, others you may have none. You may also be driving that night, which was my favorite part of the job. I loved driving the belt loaders. The hardest part of the job was being outside in layers on top of layers to stay warm, breathing in de-icing fumes, and having to push, pull, lift, and carry heavy containers and packages. I only say that because Im quite small and have asthma, so this wasn't my ideal situation. However, it was by far one of my favorite jobs to work."
good,"It was a tough job i wouldn’t recommend the job for for anyone not unless they like working at a fast pace. "
good,"lifting up to 150 lbs. doing the assembly line. sort totes from large packages, small packages and envelopes while making sure assembly packing label to ensure parcels are on the correct trucks."
good,"You're going to sweat, and if you aren't used to hard work your body will hurt the next day. It is a good work out though. You get a lot of hours and after a year you get all the benefits including paid vacation, health insurance, etc. If you stay in over a year, its worth it."
good,"It is a good first job for anyone but It is very stressful environment especially during Christmas til new years,and also you get paid weekly. If you want to get paid more, you will have to move up and maybe become a part-time supervisor or a full-time driver."
good,"struggle to balance life and work, each day depends on the pre-loaders and how they sort the truck. long commute and being a driver is a very long day"
good,Great benefits for part time however getting a full time position can sometimes take quite awhile. It is a very physical demanding job in a fast past environment.
good,"Guide trucks into docks for loading and unloading."
good,"The supervisors understand their employees' needs."
good,"Typical day at work is quick paced. I learned how to scan and sort small packages and how the whole system works. Management is cool and relaxed. Workplace is Diverse. 18-70 years of age. Hardest Part is staying positive when you do not get paid enough or make enough to survive when they only give you part time hours. Most Enjoyable is Wearing whats comfortable to me, listening to my music and meeting new people."
good,"As a Package Handler starting out the managers want you to push yourself to the limit to get the trucks ready to go by the time the drivers arrive. That being the case, you are constantly moving with little time to take a breath until the building break hits. It's a great way to stay in shape if you can keep up with the pace."
good,Short hours unless it’s peak season. Schedule should be 4-9. Earliest I came in was 1pm (during peak) and 430pm(off season) there’s no set time and not much room for advancement
good,Very clear line between Union employees and Management has been drawn in the sand. But if you can handle it the opportunity to advance is there for the taking.
good,"UPS is a good and fun workplace that offers great benefits. It also offers you a lot of outside issues that come with the company. Rather it being other people or your manager having a bad day, you are always going to feel it for that day. Learned a lot of positive things from a lot of positive people but the overall everyday culture was just not for me."
good,"Unless your are healthy as an Ox I wouldn’t recommend anybody work here, I’m no stranger to hard work but this kind of hard work as well as stress takes a toll on your body."
good,"it is a fast paced job, but hen it comes down to getting paid they dont know where your checks are at and tell you they will look into it but never do,"
good,As an over night package handler my day started at 12:00am and worked until 7:00am and had only one 10 minute break. The environment was very dull and tiresome. The managers kept rushing each worker. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a constant speedy pace running back and forth to grab your packages which came in various sizes and weights and the most enjoyable part was making friends with your co-workers.
good,early morning and late night shifts available. work was open to the elements (easily cold/hot with weather). The job is fast paced and I was required to move packages quickly and safely.
good,Ups could do better on the hiring situation. Ups will literally hired anybody and the person won't be worth anything after 2 days. Too many lazy people there.
good,Only starts at 10.20 per hour but there is room to move up. Excellent benefits and PTO after your first year. They need to start at a better rate. Also your hours are unpredictable. One week you may work 25 and the next 15.
good,"A typical day as an air ramp supervisor starts off by coming in at 4:30 am and building the load for the incoming jet.  "
good,"Adherence to the schedule is, of course, crucial for any job advancement opportunities at ups. Departments work well together in objectives and everyone there is more than helpful, as well as knowledgeable about procedures and protocols. In my humble opinion, I feel management should take more interest in the development of each employee, to ensure success in job duties, as well as, with the company."
good,"On a daily basis being able to interact with customers and provide a Great Service with Pride has helped me understand other peoples needs and meet their expectations. I have learned to drive more safely, methods to become better at organizing, being a much better defensive driver / be aware of my surroundings. Driving Safer has become routine meaning it has made me more aware and I don't have to think about the methods to safe driving. The Hardest Part of my job is trying to dig through packages and constantly having to achieve goals that are not possible to achieve on a daily basis. Expectations of a UPS Driver are a lot of the time unachievable unless you take short cuts.  This is one reason and probably the biggest reason I am currently searching for a new Career. I do not mind working hard to achieve daily goals but when goals are set by management and are really not realistic on a daily basis then this sets up a bad situation and someone could potentially get hurt. I am not that person to take the short cut because it is easier. Safety First. With the unrealistic goals to complete all deliveries in the time dispatch says it can be completed in makes it even harder when you have a family waiting at home and you miss out on all the special things in your families life. Being a UPS Driver is not for someone with a family and expects to attend their kids activities. To put it simply UPS will Provide for your family but the sacrifice a driver goes through to provide for their family is not necessarily worth it."
good,Always be ready for work. From start time until finsh. Very good job for exercises and health. Benefits after 30days if you are a supervisor. Or 1yr as a part-time employee.
good,"Working here is definitely going to challenge you. Mentally and physically. The hours are not too mess with, for the seasonal help we start work at 2am Tuesday  - Friday / Sunday into Monday we start at 930pm till almost 930am (Monday morning). There is no room for a social life while working this job, And I think this is what made it really hard for me. I love working with the public and being with people. Ups makes you feel like you can never enjoy the sun."
good,"It was okay, could have had more hours, but the people was very friendly oriented. They allow you the freedom to wear what you want, listen to music, and give you paid time off,"
good,"Fast paced position, in and out of the truck all day - good boots are a must here.  A good idea to bring lots of water and snacks to eat throughout the day as well as a healthy breakfast and lunch - you will burn off all the calories throughout the day.  Once I learned how to use the DIAD I was able to do deliveries by myself and made the job fun.  Overall it is a good job."
good,"My position is rather easy. I distribute unload assignments to workers and process their paperwork once they complete their tasks. Then, it is necessary to record any issues with the shipments they handled."
good,"its crazy "
good,"I enjoy working as manager of an awesome team of workers at this UPS Store.  A typical day at work is serving customers to the best of my ability and ensuring that each employee provides excellent customer service as well.  I have learned that hard work pays off and teamwork makes everyone's job easier.  Management works along with the employees as their support team to ensure that jobs are being performed effectively.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to completely satisfy a customer, which isn't often.  The most enjoyable part of the jobs is when the customers, the owners, and the employees are all satisfied."
good,"If you've worked your way up to package driver you already know:"
good,"I would meet up with my driver since it was temporary."
good,It was a good work environment and place I like the work hours and time supervising and co workers are great people everything had to be done at a mannerable and neatly time
good,"This is for UPS supply chain solution / logistics. Was faced paced, but not too crazy. Worst part was unpredictable hours from day to day based on orders."
good,"the work was long and boring in the middle of the day. the pace rampled up every 4 hours. probably the easiest job i've ever had. if you like working fast for a few hours then staring at your desk for a few hours, this is the job for you."
good,A good place to work if you like to stay active and keep moving. Always can count on a workout. But management is poor and forever will be. When peak season comes along just know they will forever look at you as lower then them. Not as a employee trying to make a living but as a underpaid slave.
good,I usually got to work around 530 in the morning to start loading trucks for the drivers. It was good real early but very challenging the closer it came for drivers to come to work. Best part of my job was the loaders I worked with and the drivers who became friends.
good,"Great if you're a hard worker who needs money fast and doesn't mind getting their hands dirty! The work pace is extremely fast and harsh but I loved it because it was a workout, and that itself is definitely a WORKOUT!"
good,It just a regular day at work. That is not a easy job it involves a lot physical work. The management do alright. The most enjoyable thing about working at the ups is when you finish your shift and head home.
good,The process for advancing needs to be improved. Promotion cannot be recommended.  Must apply and have management approval before applying for another position.
good,The typical day was fast paced and hard work. Hot work environment at times but wasn't too bad. I would like to work at UPS again if had the chance. It was great.
good,"On a Typical day i completed job duties like: "
good,"stressful but fun, not enough hours to make a living on just that job. Lack of full time positions. Training needs to be more focused and done consistently in a quiet environment"
good,"All in all it seemed like a fairly average place to work. The benefits were good, but didn't start until you had been working for them for a year. Once the day started there was generally something to work on constantly unless something had been delayed."
good,Very fast paced and can be fun at times; not many hours guaranteed but overtime pay is nice. Supervisors are nice and funny but kinda annoying start times.
good,Friendly employees with determined attitudes. Very helpful and productive co-workers. Hours are perfect for college or high school students. Great benefits.
good,"Customer call load exceeded existing number of customer service associates. This did improve necessary skill sets to tolerate and calm irate customers, improve organizational skills and multi tasking abilities. "
good,Typical day would be for me to just get ready to load and unload the truck all day. the most enjoyable part of my day is when we did the drop offs not so much of the pickups.
good,"little to no advancement, unless you want to be apart of the management team. the warehouses are very dirty  and dusty. They over work you, but the work is steady and the have good benefits."
good,great work for college students are a kid in high school. paid for part of my schooling the hours were a bit early but great had the rest of the day to yourself
good,"Fast paced, stressful, poor training, mid level managers are uninspiring, stagnant and not people I would want to work under for very long.  Great opportunities to advance if you take advantage of them."
good,Overall a great company to work for. The environment is great.  The people are friendly.  There isn't much promotion potential.  The job isn't bad.  Upper management is ok.
good,"Salary is lacking in comparison to other companies in the same business. Some positions in the company do not offer advancement. The benefits are great, but at times it seems like it is a dead end job. Good place to start your career, just not to finish."
good,"Great place to learn the ins and outs of the logistics business. Very experienced Operators but poor tactical management. Sups and Managers in many functions lack leadership or management skills, they're just there based on seniority."
good,"The job was a bit stressful.  The are extremely harsh on being 1minute late.  Upper management speaks to employees as if they were dogs, tend to scream instead of talk.  Overnight hours were a bit rough, i.e. start time would be at 3:30 a.m.  Work environment was sometimes a bit stressful but your coworkers make the morning a bit easier to make it through.  The job was on a time constraint because we were responsible for the packages going to the right truck for delivery.  "
good,Overall not bad. The building is old and needs to be remodeled. I loved the medical benefits but lacked recognition or company parties. Management is too strict with a very difficult attendance policy.
good,A typical day starts off with a meeting of the team of supervisor. This is where we discuss the up coming shift such as the amount of volume and major concern that need to be addressed. Once we finishing we head in to our area and inspect for all safety precautions are taking and that we a prepared for the workday. I have learned a lot from this company such managing and also how to communicate a lot better with people. The workplace culture is very fast paced and you must move quick to keep things moving. The hardest part of the job was probably just the amount of heavy lifting that was required at times. The most enjoyable part was when the teams get together to discuss new ideas and old concerns.
good,"Worked at UPS while attending college.  Great pay with benefits for college student.  Very fast pace environment, and physically demanding.  Opportunity for advancement."
good,"I liked working at UPS but I didn't like how I was part time for a long period of time. Management was friendly and understanding, but some of the other workers became over baring."
good,Good Physical Job  pay is better by year. Loading trucks for about 5 hours a day. Due to Christmas.December its 9 hours  Fast pace work. 10 minute break. Half hour break during Christmas Season. Still a Good Job
good,"Focus on work area, safety first before to start work, moving packages, push and pull, lift 50-70 lbs. teamwork, fast pace, communicate, learn about safe."
good,"Mostly great people to work with."
good,"Good benefits and perks."
good,"More than 40 nationalities in Brussels office, open minded and international working envrionment. Europe business is progressing fast and colleagues are generally nice"
good,"I almost always enjoyed working overnights, supervising a wonderful group of people. I wish I would have been able to work there full-time when I had been working there. As well as the benefits being better than most places, the fast-paced nature of the job is really what kept me working at UPS. Only a couple of things I have to complain about. There's one employee who, by the grace of the union, hasn't been terminated even though he constantly works unsafe, on multiple occasions has thrown and damaged equipment, has sexually harassed people, and repeatedly doesn't work as directed. The only other thing I dislike is how extremely difficult it seems to be to move up within the company. In fact the only reason I had to quit was because I couldn't get transferred."
good,This is a great 2nd job to pick up some extra money or to just put yourself through college. As with anywhere it has its own challenges and obstacles  to face such as the physical aspect of it. If you don't like heat or hard physical labor then this job isn't for you.
good,"The job can be very stressful. However overall I like it. Teamwork is one thing that I have learned while working at UPS. Today, I can say I have a better understanding of how to work with others to accomplish a set goal. The management is very helpful. They care about my growth as a person and employee of the company. The culture of the workplace can be improved. But I have met some incredible people while working with the company. The hardest part of the job is the work demand and pace. The work we do is very fast pace and can be demanding. However, I definitely enjoy what I do. It is a stepping stone for my future career."
good,"The main reason people work at UPS is for the benefits. I have been there for 5 years now and the hourly wage is not what keeps me, or anybody for that matter. However our zero deductibles and minimal co-pays is what makes it completely worth it. For those who can stick out the grunt work at below what many consider should be minimum wage is well worth it after the first year. The rate of pay continues to grow over the years and if you can handle the physical requirements or get enough seniority to lighten your duties in an easier department of the building it can be a great retirement position. However with a dwindling pension program it is becoming less ideal in the future I'm afraid. My position includes a lot of sorting and loading of packages, some of which are very heavy up to 150lbs. It's a great job if you like physical work and being on your feet all day."
good,"Decent place to work if you don't mind enduring low pay and low hours until you can get full time.  Once you do become full time, work/life balance is low."
good,Lots of hard work. This job used to be great when we had better workers. Now it's a struggle everyday to get through the work day. I do not like that this job gives a hard time to advance for those with facial hair.
good,"Job was very long hours and very stressful to keep up with constraints put upon employees to finish in a certain time period."
good,"Wonderful staff, low pay, enjoyed the job, but no room for advancement and low pay made it impossible to stay with. Worth noting most UPS Stores are franchised, so each store will potentially have different owners and as a result, unique experiences."
good,"Decent place to work.  Breaks are not given the way that they should be.  If a meeting needs to be held with the material handlers, it is taken out of the break time.  This causes an inability to properly eat your food because you are being rushed."
good,It gets really crazy because of the pace you work for 95% of the time. You might be surprised to get one break time for only 10 minutes during a six hours shift.
good,UPS is a okay place to work for students part-time during the summer. The pay is pretty good but they don't really like to work with students schedules.
good,Very fast-paced and physically demanding. Great Union and benefits. Can be overwhelming a majority of the shift. Pretty lenient with attendance. Flexible raises.
good,"Great place to work. There are lots of advancements, but FT supervisors can be very hard to deal with. Some treat you like trash off street. This is a great company with many opportunities."
good,its only 4 hours a day sometimes and they really don't work us that. only around holidays we get more hours. The management is poor no commicuition at all. its a lot to say.
good,UPS has a wonderful and supporting Union that offers amazing health insurance.  We have a great team that I work with on a daily basis and the workout in the early AM is outstanding.  I recommend UPS for anybody looking for a part time job with GREAT insurance!!
good,we had a nice break great people to work. management was very nice and gave break if needed. break was short but we still got one it was about going in getting work done we worked as team went very smoothly.
good,"UPS is a fast paced job that requires constant squatting, lifting over 20 lbs and being able to sort up to 1000 packages an hr. Management wasn't the best, they only cared about the goals that needed to be meet and no matter how it needed to be done it was done."
good,"A typical day of work is, going to your station, working with your partner to organize the packages and parcels into the right bags for delivery onto a conveyer belt. I learned the process in which packages are collected and dispersed. Management is friendly and fair. Everyone is friendly towards each other and we chat when it's break time. Hardest part of the job is enduring the work when sick or it's hot., also it's very fast paced and you need to keep up with your co-worker. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling satisfaction in finishing the work load of the day as well as being able to talk to your co-workers freely as you work, as long as you maintain good work flow."
good,A typical day at work consists of loading and unloading trailers. The hardest part of the job would have to be the lifting and lowering of heavy packages.
good,Weird way of going about everything. Too many calls just to go to work and no guarantee of hours even though it was busy season. Some good people somw bad
good,"The work is difficult, but definitely manageable. The worst part about the job is management; more specifically, lower level management and supervisors. Most have little knowledge of the day-to-day aspects of running the warehouse. Some are very rude, and I have personally heard one threaten another employee. They are very demanding and tend to micro-manage, which is understandable considering the pressure they face from the higher ups. That being said, once you've reached seniority, there is little incentive to work hard. Raises are scheduled, and if you get your job done early or on time, they will likely make you do someone else's job (who has most likely done just enough to get by)."
good,I was a package handler for the summer. It is very physically demanding. I enjoyed the early morning workouts. It is very fast paced and tedious. They tend to throw you into the fire instead of properly training you.
good,UPS is a stable and successful company to work for. They believe in cross training employees and management in many different areas so they knowledge you gain is invaluable.
good,Most positions are very routine and fast paced in production areas. I learned that moving up or out quickly is important if advancement is desired. The culture is somewhat casual but conservative (business casual dress code). The hardest part of job was adjusting to new supervisors and added responsibilities without compensation. Many employees accepted lateral moves with little chance of promotion. Most enjoyable part of job was work/life balance. Getting time off was rarely an issue except around holidays when seniority takes precedent.
good,"UPS while it boasts this ""hire from within"" mentality that's far from the case. I've seen then move people less qualified into higher positions simply because of seniority, not because of understanding or experience. Everyone is agitated from working in a hot warehouse all summer constantly moving, and the pay is only $10.20 an hour which may as well be fully fledged slave labor, half of the time we are being sent home anyway. Waste of time truly, UPS is a desperate last attempt type of job, seeing as they hire anyone."
good,The amount of Hard work you put in is not worth much to the company. They pay you pennies on the dollar unless your a union Driver and they treat there supervisor like dirt and the pay is just as bad unless your full time.
good,"The job is pretty simple to learn. I attend school, and the job is very flexible. So, I never had any conflicts with schools when taking exams. I would recommend students to apply for the job."
good,"A fast paced work environment. Gain experience in leading employees, developing cost efficient delivery routes, and employee training and development."
good,UPS was a great place to work part time while i was attending school.  They compensated me well for the job and tasks i was expected to perform.  I would refer one of my friends to work here if they were a college student home for christmas break and was looking to make some extra money before going back to school.
good,"I love this company because it's athletic, it builds discipline, and makes you phisically fit. It's a very military type of environment and I personally think it brings the most masculine traits out of every man"
good,"this was a seasonal job , i learned that you had to be able to lift large packages for this job . the management was good and the pay was good . the hardest part of the job was working with a driver who was tryna make you do everything knowing you were a drivers helper the most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid time and a half for working on holidays"
good,"It was exactly a good job for people either on college break or looking to get experience with delivery. Decent hours and compensation, but must be in shape and ready to work in bad weather conditions"
good,There was a lot of teamwork. There was also bullying from 2 specific employees that management was unable to get rid of because of the worker's Union.
good,You will get sent home early at least 2 days per week. Less than 20 hours per week. Must move at a fast pace lifting heavy boxes. Did not seem like there was much room for promotion.
good,Its a great place for college students because the hours are so flexible but you can not survive off the job alone.  Package handlers are a huge part of the company but we are not compensated as much as I think we deserve.
good,It's not all they great unless you like hard work in  an hot and cold environment. Don't get enough hours unless your a driver. Or it's peak season. ( Thanksgiving and Christmas).
good,"Management is the problem. No compassion, all they care about is how they can place all blame on the individual yet they have ""teamwork"" banners posted everywhere."
good,"I worked very hard on a computer all day and dealing with people."
good,UPS is a good place to work with great benefits and job stability. They offer a great training program when first hired to make you feel comfortable enough to perform your job. They also like to promote from within. If you are customer oriented and don't mind a call center environment it is a good place to work.
good,"I worked at UPS for about three years. Started off loading the 52' trailers. Some days were annoying and backbreaking. The only reason i stood for so long was the comradely, decent pay and benefits."
good,UPS is a good job it has great benefits. My only problem with ups is the pay the work is heavy labor but the pay is what i could stay for.Also ups wasnt that close to my house so i felt like i was wasting my time honestly.
good,Ups is a good job but it also a stressful job at the same time. But overall I would tell a friend ups is a good job but be prepared for some hard work.
good,Tough company to work for but the benefits and pay is excellent. High turnover. Management browbeats the local managers and the local managers are forced to browbeat the employees.
good,"This is a decent job for a college student because it offers help towards school and guaranteed hours. It provides a good workout year round for those who like to stay active and they pay weekly , direct deposit optional as well. You can move up through the business fast if that's what you seek.  It could be a much better job if they were more consistent with expectations and reality. There are many contradictions that make the job difficult to enjoy being in."
good,"once I was hired full time after seasonal I was never given a 40 hour work week.  I was trained for 4 days & than sent on my way.  it was a hard adjustment, and not having the same schedule or route is frustrating.  majority of the supervisors were great but there are a handful that do not want to teach."
good,"Nice place to work, not too demanding. Nice job to gain experience into working world. So a good first job, I would like to say. Don't expect many hours."
good,Working here was definitely tiring but it made me a hard worker for sure. It also makes your days go by faster and you are more eager to work as the hours progress.
good,"a good opportunity to work with others. the hardest part picking up heavy boxes. they have good benefits, they paid weekly. I had to sort different boxes in different areas. I learn how to be a leader and not a follower."
good,"I enjoyed working at the UPS Store.  Although it could be stressful at times due to customer expectations, it was nice when we were able to satisfy the customer and get the job done right."
good,"Ups is a Very productive, yet friendly work environment. Although at times the work load can be a bit overwhelming, co workers are usually more than happy to assist you."
good,Load/Unload trucks as fast but as safely and accurately as required. Being finished and having a lot of free time makes a great balance and incredible benefits.
good,Was Very Excited to Receive this Job. I loved how it was EARLY morning so when you were off you Still Had the whole day to Yourself. i would Definitely recommend this job
good,"Quality Control on Aerospace parts. Mechanical measuring to Blueprints, completing various computer programs along with paperwork to Pratt and Whitney Specifications."
good,I come in normally around 5am and load package cars till around 9am. I have learned how to be a hard worker from UPS. Management here isn't the greatest but it is tolerable. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace of the work. The most enjoyable part of the work is the workout I get.
good,UPS  is a great place to work. Excellent staff and employees that make work challenging and fun. Very fast paced environment with tons of room for growth.
good,"I learned that UPS pays off in the long run. And by long run I mean after 20 years of working there. Once you pass your probation, you have a great amount of job security."
good,"At this days  don't have enough  work for the employees that are at the shift. This is why a'm looking for a job. I work very hard to complete my 8 hour duties every day.Every one have to do it . "
good,"This was overall a hard job if you are not used to lifting heavy packages and items that weigh over 100 pounds. It was in a hot environment, especially in the summertime."
good,"been with the company for 6 years, continue to be with the company because the insurance is amazing, started when pay was 8.50 an hour 6 years later I'm bumped to 14.50 which is starting pay for a part time supervisor at the company. bigger raises while in the union. depending on where you work would determine your  typical  day. its busy and can be overwhelming and frustrating. turn over rate is horrible. I've seen 100s of people come and go."
good,"Golf Cart Worker, open to all elements of weather, no roof or windshield on cart, took a long time to get supplies needed, unorganized training and hectic at times, management easy to work with"
good,good place to work good pay good trucks steady work have good future good benifits good tools for the job good to meet pleople
good,Its a great to work if you have children because the benefits. if ever want to find a job that will give you a work out in all seasons just come on and work at ups.
good,"Employees work hard, and not everyone is treated fairly. Some areas have problems with slacking employees that management puts more pressure on deligent employees while letting others slack. The hours are not that bad, but not nearly enough pay for standing put in 2 degree weather."
good,"Enjoyable job. Great staff. Low employee turnover at this location. This  is however a franchise and no room for growth after reaching store manager position. No benefits were available."
good,Great job security with room for advancement if you plan on sticking it out to be a Driver. Management could use a little work. Once you hit your 30 day mark you're good.
good,"UPS based on the job you are given can be very difficult or very easy. The people that you work with is what gets you through the time there since its very labor intensive and most of the time mindless. If you like the conveyor type work style this may be a good place to be, but you want to use your head more then you might want to try moving up to a different department. Moving up in management is a lot based on passing the test and also based on who you know."
good,It's a good job if you can take the pressure of moving fast and lifting boxes between 1lb to 70lb. Working in the summer is the difficult part. That's were a lot of people quit
good,"Non-stop, fast paced work environment with amazing benefits and job security. Only concern is that it can wear down your body if you don't practice safe work techniques"
good,"Job was straining, very fast paced, no slowing down all shift. Do-workers were decent, not people persons though. Very physically demanding."
good,I definitely enjoyed the fast pace environment. Constantly on the go and having something to do. That could also be the downside if not properly staffed which is definitely going to happen.
good,Handle packaging.great environment.need more heaters in warehouse.very cold during the winter.my experience with ups has been quit an adventure. I recommend anyone applying for the job
good,"I worked here for five years and loved being at Ups. I would recommend this job to anyone who is willing to work hard, looking for a career."
good,Everyday at UPS is different because we work with so many different companies shipping freight to so many different countries. Everyday is a new day full of new challenges. UPS has educated me in dangerous goods shipments and how to process them according to IATA regulations. Management works closely with employees to make sure we have the skills and tools to meet our clients needs. Co-workers work and collaborate together to get the job done in the best way possible. The hardest part of working for UPS would be since we work with so many different people and companies it is very difficult to make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of working for UPS is the gratification and challenges of shipping freight and dangerous goods according to TSA and IATA regulations and the shipments making it to their final destinations. Shipper and Consignee being happy with my accomplishment brings me happiness.
good,"a typical day is 9-11 hrs , management is more concerned about cost and production rather than the people who perform the work."
good,"Fast work place, learned Time management, learned stress management, friendly environment, 3 1/2 to 5 hour shifts, good management,"
good,My experience at UPS was long due having my hopes high for a future promotion. Everyday managers expect you to change something new and follow up with the rules and regulations.  Very difficult job for a very low pay.
good,The job is very demanding and can be stressful at time but overall its a nice place to work. You move up fast in the company after a few months. Plus they have great benefits after 1 year.
good,"The first days is the worst so many packages you have to load and you really don't know which spot they have to go but after a week you should be up to speed and it's smooth sailing after, we'll that up to you depending on how hard you work"
good,Only reason I am looking for another job because I need more money to support my family. Ups is a very good company that has a lot of benefits to help support workers and there family.
good,A place to learn how to be a supervisor. There is an opportunity to move on to the next level or different departments in the company. Just need good effort.
good,"Not some where i would start a career, but is good for benefits and as a second job. Good job coming out of high school as well."
good,"The ups stores are independently owned by the owners, dealing with packing, shipping, mail boxes,printing, graphic designing & other related services."
good,Working at UPS was great because the other employees were friendle. The support system they have is outstanding and the managers are the best. I would recommend UPS.
good,Not for the faint of heart. Must be disciplined to deal with long hours and physically able to handle hundreds of packages a day. My organization skills have increased ten fold as well as my patience and endurance. Fast paced job with many rewards. They do work very hard with those who want to climb the corporate ladder. Processes in place as far as training and exercises to help anyone move up more quickly.
good,I enjoyed my the time I spent at UPS this was a good learning experience. This will help and aid me on my next job the online class that they provided were very helpful.
good,"Great company advancement, education assistance, pension and stock options available.  Great opportunities for lateral transfers and the opportunity to learn about the transportation industry."
good,Its ok the pay can be better the hours could be better. Its really hot in there they could change that make it better. Other then that the job is ok..
good,"- Mornings can be rather quiet but picks up significantly during the day."
good,fast paced and always on the go. everything is time...and to management if your waisting time you're waisting money. your shift finishes quite fash and its a workout.
good,"It's a great company to work for if you have ""tough skin"".  The opportunities for advancement are good but you have to put yourself out as moving up is your best plan.  They are stuck in their old ways but overall they compensate you for your continued commitment."
good,99% of the packages weigh under 10 pounds and are very easy to lift. However the volume at which you must sort these packages into trucks in a very limited amount of time is preposterous. I think maybe 50 years ago it was at a human level but now you have to be at least 3 people or 1 robot. If they want robots they should just install them. If you plan on working for them never ever work preload its impossible to do the assigned job without help. There are no breaks at any point. However everyone who works directly next to you and supervisors are very nice they get their orders to work humans to death from upper management. Might be because a certain CEO wants more numbers right before he retires to look good not sure.
good,"You had to move at a fast pace and keep up with sorting the boxes, like a good estimation of 1000 boxes per hour for 4-5 hours a day, I learned that not every job is for anyone and people are very inconsiderate of others, the management was very good and I could talk to anyone if I had a problem, and it would be solved, some co-workers were good but most complained about the amount of work that was in front of them , the hardest part of the job was deling with the heat during the summer and the cold during the winter, the most enjoyable part was the amount of people I could get connected to and be able to be in a union."
good,My only reason to stick with the job was because it was going to pay for all my school but while I was there I wasn't enrolled and I felt more towards taking a year off (2016-2017) so I decided it was best that I quit before I started to fall off of what my goals are. Plus the pay was not worth the hours to me.
good,"The pay for the work was ok, especially during the Holidays. There are opportunities for advancement if you care about the job. Short hours allow you to live a life outside of work."
good,on a typical day i'll sort the unloaders packages and send them to the right zip codes or state to the correct color coded belt in the facility.
good,"I work in the Primary Sort area of a suburban facility, I am required to sort by human readable codes 1100 packages per hour, ranging in size from document envelopes, up to 70lb boxes the size of a mini fridge. My shift (evenings) has required me to go into work when most people are heading home for the evening, and requiring me to allocate double the estimated travel time, to go from the far ends of the nearly full parking lot, to my work area. Hours worked are unpredictable, and start times varied. When I started, my employment, I had three days of classroom training to learn how to do my job, and five days of one on one hands on training in my area. following completion of this training, I had thirty days to develop competency in my work to attain permanent employment. Not only am I expected to handle packages safely and strongly, I have to have memorized a lengthy and often amended set of sort charts to direct packages by. I have been sorting for over two months now, and I still struggle to combine speed and accuracy, but my supervisor is pushing for more speed, despite my struggles with accuracy, especially in the face of new rules that complicate routing and slow down reading the label. The expectations of my work and the demanding attitudes of my supervisor make it one of the toughest jobs I have ever seen. My co workers are the best part of the working environment, and many of them know things about the job that I have never learned. If it wasn't for the benefits, retention incentives, and my co workers, I might have lost all motivation to continue in my position, and"
good,Great co-workers and the work is not the hard once the body get use to it .Need to be fit for this job.There were good bentifs once you become a full time employee.
good,"Working at UPS on a daily bases was labor, fast pace business, and  strategically. I have learned how to work under pressure, and quickly adapt to the equipment used in the working progress. Even though there was a lot of profanity with in the UPS hub, I still learned to work with them. The hardest part of the job was when my slide became backed up with packages. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to keep up with the packages, the challenge of strategically placing the packages in there place, and the pay."
good,"Self-management, One of the hardest job I had because everyday was a new delivery route and people are very excited to receive their products."
good,"The hardest part is that you're putting a lot of strain on your body, the breaks are only 10 minutes there's a lot of yelling"
good,"i work at UPS because it paid for my three degrees and i am part time package handler and had full benefits. Advancement is good to be a part time supervisor, package car driver, or P.E mechanic. Hard to get full time jobs there."
good,i ejoyed the work everyday. I learned alot and worked at a steady pace to meet daily requirements. my supervisors were cool but my co-workers were kind of lazy.i didnt enjoy the hours or pay was enough to take care of my bills that i had
good,The job was fast paced. Loved that the work day flew by. Helped me stay in shape and paid for school.All about hitting the numbers.
good,multitasking and fast paced with a very physically demanding part of  every day shift. Must be able to endure all weather conditions and stress when under pressure.
good,Helped learn to work in a fast paced environment during the holidays under minimal supervision. good money for holiday work
good,"The supervisors have it made they do nothing but stand around and talk, but I was lucky to have some great co workers to teach me the ropes"
good,The best thing about this job is that it has great benefits. Its a great place to start for a college student. Great retirement plan. The management is so unorthodox at times. Most jobs are part-time
good,very good company to work for if you are just joining the work industry.great employer for first time workers its hard work but in the end it is worth it.
good,"I strive to work within an establishment that is willing to motivate and elevate their employees. A motivated employee leads to a happy employee which is equal to a productive employee."
good,Typical day is ensuring that all packages get delivered on the day.There are challenges when you receive more volume than planned. Its a challenge but it generally gets done.
good,Very chill job. however it should pay more. i work my butt off making 10.10 an hour and i don't think its fair. i don't work for very long either
good,must be able to lift u to 75 pounds a day and move quick and fast.also pay attention to what you are loading into the package cars and must watch how you unload the trailer's due to some of the boxes may have breakables and chemicals that affect you and your fellow co-workers.
good,"i would work again, but i disliked the part time. it was an okay workplace. cool and respectful people who managed and worked there."
good,Daily duties are the same for employees i learned to work calmly in hugh intense situations.Hardest part of my job was ensuring employees are held to the work standards the agreed on easiest part for rewarding employees for a job well done
good,"Not that fulfilling of a place to work, good benefits and good working environment, management doesn't care about its employees to the degree it should to promote retention."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, but the work could get stressful at times. Our store was under staffed and the owner would always be outside of the United States. Although stressful this job helped me grow as a person and gave me a chance to show what I was capable of. I helped to establish a good rep ore with our clients. The best part was becoming a manager by showing the owner how hard I could work."
good,A good job to have while seeking higher education or working other jobs. They are good at working around schedules. I like being a union worker and having job security
good,"Not for anybody who doesn't like to work constantly."
good,"As a package handler, your not paid enough and you're usually overworked. The part time hours just don't cut it if you have bills to pay."
good,I worked for this company for almost 4 years it's a great place to work if your a college student looking for a part time job other then that the place sucks. Working 12 hours a week can't support any average human being with a life and bills the best thing about there was the family environment and the benefits ups has the best benefits of any job I've ever worked at and I lost 40 pounds unloading 10 trucks a night while there they also have great supervisors and management team that's rear to say that about any work place in America today
good,When I first started things looked a lil hard but being around the environment I was my co-workers made me feel welcomed and supported me through the whole way.
good,Friendly co-workers and good environment in the non-operations area. Most employees come from operations prior to working in a non-op capacity. Compensation is not as competitive as one would hope but still offer healthcare plans.
good,"Good environment to work. Would recommend this place to work to anyone. Also, a productive place to work. Also, pay is not to bad."
good,"I was a long time employee for UPS and most of my experience was a positive one.  Working hours were fixed and easy to live with, job security was guaranteed as UPS is only interested in bringing in more business to its Louisville operation and the people you work with are diverse, interesting individuals with a wide array of backgrounds.  Regular pay raises, extensive benefits, and union representation also ensured a more pleasant working environment."
good,Busy place to work that keeps you constantly moving and staying involved in what is going on within the company. Creates efficient communication skills between workers and management.
good,"Being a Delivery Driver for UPS, was a very challenging job having to deliver priority package in a timely manner, But intermingling with the customer and each day presented different challenges made the job fun and exciting."
good,"Great benefits, the health insurance was amazing!! Only problem is they dont really have much for under 21 years of age that is full time. Its very hard work and you must be able to handle lifting heavy things, which they tell you up front,"
good,"Overall its a decent environment to work in but the pay is unfortunately very low. My coworkers and I have a good working relationship, and I enjoy working with my superiors."
good,everyday we had to be at work on time sorting packages and memorizing of the zip codes for sorting.it was fun to work with some people but not everyone.
good,It was an ok job but it was only temporary. a lot of Co-workers had trouble finishing tasks on time and often had me stop working outside and come in to finish their tasks.
good,"Daily rountine:"
good,"One of the most ethical companies to work for. A typical day of work would be waking up at 3:30 am and loading up about 4 trucks. I learned to work in a fast-paced environment, work with a team, unloading and loading packages on conveyor belt, learn about inventory control, and most importantly learn to think ahead, be positive, and be responsible. This job is very difficult, you're always on the move so safety is always implemented."
good,Tough place to work. It is micro managed at every level and it tends to create a hostile work environment for employees and management.
good,"The company is a good place to work for someone who wants to settle and comfortable with mediocrity. This is not to say that there is no motivation for employees to want to move up and take on more responsibilities.  Coworkers are great, just sometimes people can be tunnel visioned and only care about their focus of work."
good,"My experience at UPS was very rewarding. I actually was surprised with all the experience I obtained from this position. My work hours were from 8:00pm to 2:00am, which meant I worked the graveyard shift. I was able to learn team building skills by working with other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to multi-task."
good,"Great job for the security and benefits after you stay for a year, but the money felt horrible after a while considering you give up all your energy doing the job, so I left. Also, the rules don't really matter because of the union which sucks sometimes (leads to some really lazy co-workers), and the volume of boxes can suck too but otherwise all the above works to your advantage as well if you want to roll that way."
good,"A challenging workplace that is not for everyone. Opportunities for advancement and upward mobility are good if you can succeed under incredible pressure in a high stress, fast-paced environment. Company is extremely numbers-focused beyond reasonability or even employee safety."
good,"I enjoyed learning a lot about this company. Although part-time, they let me make as many hours as i wanted. Management was great. Enabled to be flexible with you, to a degree. Hardest part of the job- altering your own life to come in to work when they want you. No set time to leave, hard when your busy outside from the work environment."
good,"Management preaches safety first but demands production. Nothing is ever done right, even when done exactly as you were asked. Unrealistic requirements. Extremely over worked for a part time position. Many integrity issues such as putting in less paid time than actually worked, forced to put in two 10min paid breaks and a 30min non working lunch for working over 6 hours which you are never given, and certifying employees on paper and training books without the actual training or testing. This job was great at first, but when the division manager left and they moved all the management team around to fill positions, that's when thing went bad. Your also stuck as a part time employee for 10 plus years which doesn't cut it for people with families!"
good,"I come in every night we have a presort meeting so we know plan for the night. Employees are under payed but still work very hard so I commend them for it. Being in management is fun, the hardest part of my job is hit production and being 20 places at once. I enjoy the people and co-workers around me."
good,"My years at UPS taught me a lot about working hard and doing whatever it took to insure that the satisfaction of and commitments to our customers were honored. Most importantly, always doing my best to succeed, no matter what the circumstances. Thinking through problems and finding solutions to provide proper service. Coming through for our customers under difficult and strenuous circumstances. There were no easy days at UPS. Micromanagement was rampant. Either through unfair and benign analytics, or through unfair, or unrealistic production standards. Days were filled with constant problematic issues, which had to be dealt with quickly and safely to make commitments to customers, and to stay safe on the roads. Almost every day, the work load was overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers everyday. We had wonderful customers, who respected us, and knew how difficult of a job it was. My co-workers were wonderful as well. Gregarious, humorous, salt of the earth types, that were helpful under difficult and unenjoyable circumstances, which were shared by all."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day while working for UPS. "
good,"I enjoyed working here for a bit until I got put under new management, the manager I was stuck with was terrible and favored certain employees over others. I only seemed to have one good manager and they need a new management hiring process because I was under some of the worst management I have ever been under."
good,Everyday for the most part is really busy its a fast pace enviornment. Im constantly moving between helping my co-workers and my own job duties.
good,It was an ok work experience.. Bad management good pay and good co workers... Great place great pay and benefits but managers can be little rough
good,Its a very fast paced job work hard for a good 4 hours. and then your out not bad at all and the benefits are well worth it. the co workers are full of laughter never hear any arguing nice n calm workflow.
good,"This is a great company to work for. I have learned how to multitask, manage my time and communicate to all levels of management. I have also learned many skills in sales and business knowledge that will help me further my career. While working a sales position I have also learned how to analyze many types of charts, financial data and forecasting. I have been lucky to start my career with a fortune 50 company."
good,"Store Manager is great!  She is a role model.  "
good,I work in a nice honest office environment where everyone helps each other out. The company will promote within and encourages you to do so if you would like to further you carrier.
good,"A typical day at work here was not knowing when they would send you home, I learned my first shipment at this job and I absolutely loved it. Management was very unorganized all over the place. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. There was not really a hard part of the job everything seemed to roll easily. The most enjoyable thing was learning something I've always wanted to which was shipping."
good,Strict deadlines and work requirements. Management was not very supportive and willing to listen to employee feedback.
good,work days include un-air conditioned work environment so hot or cold days effect our building temperature. ive learned to sort and provide good customer service. management can be quite disturbing at times since my particular job doesnt require supervision. co workers are quite sociable and easy to work with. hardest part of the job is 2 certain doors that get flooded out every 10 mins. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the truck finished after 1 hr and 45 mins of heat and sweat.
good,"Working for UPS as a package handler is hard work. HR will direct you to a working location in the hub and give you title, you will either work in the unload, loading, sorting, or air building (small sort). Sorting requires you to take and pass a sort test, you will need to know zip codes, and you will get a 1.00$ raise. If you are in the unload to can expect to unload 5-10+ trailers a shift depending on the work load. There is not much you need to know as a unloader you just get everything out of the trailer and onto the extendo belt as fast and safe as you can and move to the next trailer, its hard work and you will get a work out and sweat. Sorting is self explanatory you stand and sort packages all shift nothing else to it. If you are a loader like I was you can expect to constantly lifting and loading trailers for 5 to 6 hours a day. Packages can weigh from 5 ounces- 100 pounds+. You are required to scan each package, build strong and solid walls with packages, handle hazmats, and pick up irregular freight packages that drivers drop off outside your trailer. Management wants you to work fast and have at least a (200 package per hour load rate) so that trailers can get out on time. Management can be annoying sometimes but they are just doing their job. They won't bother you if you are doing your work. Starting pay is 10.00$ i believe now that the new contract is negotiated. pay increase after 90 days and another increase after 1 year. Union dues start at 25.00$ a month. Good benefits with tuition assistance if you are a college student they will pay for books and help with"
good,Was good pay while the season lasted. You will not have to worry about hours during peak season(Nov-Jan) You get 8 hours or more everyday.
good,"i would have liked the job had it been a little slower paced. i was put at the end of the conveyor belt with the three heaviest trucks within my first week and was not able to really have much training. the veterans did not want the vehicles that i had and therefore were put at the front of the belt with lighter and smaller trucks. when a mistake was made with the loading, the driver would cuss you out and ridicule you in front of the other team members. there were nice drivers but the three trucks i had expected things a certain way every day. i did not continue work past the peak season."
good,"In my 5 years with UPS, my days were identical.  I mostly worked as a sorter, which means that I sorted small packages into bins, to be bagged.  The bags were then shipped to other UPS locations for delivery to the customers.  Had great relationships with co-workers and management."
good,UPS Freight is a great company to work for that is very demanding and requires the ability to multitask at a high level.  I thoroughly enjoy the job because it is a challenge each and everyday.  The best part of the job is leading the shift and managing the work as I deem necessary.  Challenges include keeping the entire staff motivated throughout the night.
good,The job is great and easy but most the supervisors are total idiots as if they all forgot how to unload or load a trailer which makes it hard for them to lean and make it hard on others as well.
good,"The free insurance and free college money is great, but the management will work you until you drop.  If you file for work injury they will harass you trying to convince you that you are fine"
good,spent my days making appointments. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers they made the day go by very fast. There was never a dull moment always busy but in a good way.
good,Ad-hoc requests from the sales force. Very strict time frame for completion of tasks. Very different work processes for similar positions cross functionally. Co-workers are definitely a plus
good,very fast pace work environment staff can be very grompy older crowd managers are very dwn to earth drivers are rude be ready to work in very hott spaces no room for advancement
good,"I would receive inbound calls from customer and resolve their technical issues whether it be computers, printers, web navigation, billing or customer service issues, such at package tracking, UPS information"
good,Overall UPS as a company is great. it comes with good pay/benefits and good advancement but certain hubs like the one i work at is not so fair. even though I enjoy the work which is coming in sorting or loading trucks everyday which is not hard at all like most people think the management and hours are horrible. We only work 3 hours a night which is not enough for a person to survive off and the management somewhat places you in a position to fail. the very things that they ask you to do they will turn around and ask you not to do it then complain when you dont do it. Also the hardest workers are targets for doing more work while the other workers kick back and relax.
good,"les poste les plus intéressant sont le smol et les petits colis .              "
good,"UPS sucks period.........BUT if you were to stay there for more than a year, the benefits are phenomenal!! Plus the company has its own Union. Job advancement is really upon request."
good,"Spend 9 to 10 hours at the office, take inbound calls assisting customers with their packages shipped through UPS. Learned a lot of things specially in the Logistics business. Co-workers are very easy to get along with. Management is fine but may need to be more aware of their people's concerns and practice people skills. Hardest part of the job maybe is talking the whole shift without any mute buttons available and it's continuous incoming calls. Enjoyable part is the payout."
good,"Basically, it's a decent place to work at. The good points are: flexibility, very good benefits, promotion from within, and almost impossible to get fired. The bad points: very bureaucratic, borderline-useless management, and almost impossible to get fired (a lot of useless people who shouldn't work there)."
good,I  did alot of package handling it was a tough job becasue we go hours non stop doing the same thing. the hardest part about it was that not everyone has the same pace
good,"Nice managers and co-workers, they are very friendly."
good,great company to work for amazing  benefits. I learned a lot as far as the business aspect what it takes to run a company. and I also learned a lot about people. the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that the customer was happy receiving there package in a timely fashion and knowing that I helped with that process Is enough for me.
good,"if you manage to make it past probation period its a great place to be, light workdays everyday but the hours are pretty varied, trying to advance is terrible because its very political and all about who you know, the people who have been there and have seniority hardly ever work because they are protected by the union, im surprised any work gets done at all when there arent any new people who are busting there backs just to keep a job"
good,Package Handler very easy job. Co-workers nice. Management was decent. Limited hour given. I feel more hours could have been given.
good,At UPS I learned how to flow volume through the building. I also learned how to not let one operation fail as one would succeed. The hardest part of the job was constantly explaining the damage control to the employees. The best part was having everything done and wrapped up for the drivers.
good,its was a good seasonal job only work during the winter hoilday i learn more how the ups package service work
good,"Having been with the company for nearly 15 years, I have held many roles that enabled me to hone skills and become a well-rounded employee.  My last assignment was a technical role that not only entailed project management skills, but also required a technical knowledge of network hardware in order to provide the level of support required.  The data network is a massive beast that involves a data-center like building, multiple MDF and IDF locations, as well as multiple campuses across the city.  Managing the deployments and support of that hardware on a daily basis is a huge undertaking, and required a pro-active, organized, highly technical approach. The pressure involved in maintaining the ""always up"" status when a problem arose could be overwhelming, however very satisfying when accomplished."
good,"When I first started, I was told, ""This is a hard job."" And it has been, but with proper work ethic, determination and experience, this job can be rewarding in its own way."
good,"A typical work day was cold."
good,"U.P.S. is a great company if you are not interested in college & want to pursue a Career as a Driver. Your workload during peak is massive & U.P.S. has a strict make it fit everything must go attitude towards packages. With any job you'll have helpful supervisors & some who are in a position of power & won't let you forget it. Many employees have the ""Hey it's a check"" attitude. Wouldn't recommend working there without joining The Union."
good,"UPS is a very good job with really good pay, benefits, insurance, and job security. "
good,"i had known the owners of the ups store that i worked at so the job was relatively easy, work wasnt exactly challenging, it was actually quite monotonous. i was a good job to have during my college years."
good,"UPS is not a job for everyone, it's a job based on extreme hard work and keeping up with the work flow. It is a job that keeps you constantly busy and working hard. It is not a job for the weak, it involves having to be capable of lifting heavy boxes that vary in weight. It is a union based job and the benefits are excellent."
good,"it was ups , i was a loader and un loader , same thing every morning."
good,"Working at UPS was a sure fire way to explain hard but fun work!"
good,"i enjoyed working here, it was a great experience working here."
good,Supervise employees in loading delivery trucks.  In charge of delegating jobs to employees to maximize efficiency to get trucks loaded by nine o'clock in the morning.
good,Depending on your boss... This can be a great place to work. It gets tough and as in any other retail establishment you will have your extremely difficult customers but as long as your boss trains you right youll have no issues.
good,the most unsafe place i ever had a chance of working at and the management there was horrible but im a hard working and i like to push my body to the limit
good,"Working for UPS really improved my teamwork skills. We all need each other in some way and it's great. There are times we work independently,too."
good,"Long days with little recognition from senior management. "
good,"I did enjoy that for the majority of my tenure there, I was able to self manage and do some traveling throughout the district. The most challenging part of the position was doing all day rides with drivers on a small seat. The most enjoyable was being able to travel with a good team and meeting various people within the organization. I learned that change comes often and quickly in the corporate world."
good,"The only negative point about this company for me was the working hours.  I worked 13-14 years of graveyard shift, which I couldn't continue that any more."
good,everyone who works their only does enough to get by and thats it
good,Very hard work and you  must be phsyically capable of the work required.
good,Its a good job but it requires long hours and short finish times.
good,overall it was ok didn't like the overnight shift at the time and the small payrate
good,"6 hour work day "
good,Load trailers with packages. Co workers were ok. Job keeps you moving
good,This would have been a great place for career growth if the staff wasn't so complacent and lackluster.
good,Every morning we would have a meeting stating our forecast work load for the day.
good,"ive been at UPS for nearly 4 years n havent made any work advancements, and the environment could be kept alot cleaner"
good,"Very good learning experience as far as learning how the postal system works. Start off by picking up business packages that are due to be delivered the next day. Then going to do the residential area. Getting on and off the truck very frequently,my co worker was a very humble and honest person."
good,"Typically work close to 5 hours a day"
good,"Short hours, hard work, with great benefits. Honestly I believe your experience depends on your attitude. You work alone a lot."
good,"good work environment and a good steady work pace. Good co-workers, lively people. and overall good management."
good,I was just a seasonal driver helper and was a good experience delivering packages.
good,Put packages onto a belt which were transferred to a trailer and shipped off to a bigger UPS center.
good,I would love to find another warehouse job. In enjoy working at ups because you have to be focus to work there.I also enjoy lifting packages.Hardest thing about ups is waking up at 3.00am in the mourning.
good,"find the load charts of whats going into the container I will be loading into, check labels and be aware of hazmat labels. Communicate with coworkers and help them out if they need help."
good,Over worked.... Under paid.... Get to work grab a scanner... Load boxes for 5-8 hours go home...
good,A typical work day at UPS in very intense fast paced a lot of moving and yelling and screaming. Always walking up and down my area that I supervise to make sure things are going smooth. I have learned that you have to pick and choose what managment people will be there to assist you and who wont. There are co workers that really and truly take pride in UPS and some of course that dont. I have learned that a lot of working at UPS is mental and if u can make it past the mental part u have overcame the hardest part. The most enjoyable part about my job is the pay.
good,"Great pay for a part time supervisor with tuition reimbursement as well as full benefits. A lot of room for advancement if you are willing to put in the time and dedication (may have to wait a while) internal promotions are a huge staying force at UPS. However, major turnoff is the long hours once you enter full time supervisor in operations as work/life balance is clearly non-existant which is a huge turn off for long term commitment in this job."
good,Package delivery drivers are the most fit people on the planet.
good,The people are cool to be around. The supervisors are very laid back but you work hard and i personally feel you don't get paid enough for the work that you do.
good,"Generally left on my own in the store I learned time management, customer service skills over the phone and in person, and self motivation. Many of the customers that came in had no idea that the UPS Store does so many things: faxes, packing, printing, copying, and shipping. We became the secretary for all of the local businesses. "
good,"This is a good first job, especially if you need money for college. However, it isn't an easy job. You wake up early in the morning and the day usually starts off, and ends, hard and strong. There is a fifteen minute break though, so it gives you a chance to catch your breath. It does pay well for a first job. It helped me get through my first year of community college without a single ounce of debt. The management is good and the co-workers are friendly. Again, good first job, I don't know if I'll go back though."
good,Good learning experience for me.  The driver's were very helpful in teaching me about UPS.
good,Some supervisors are extremely helpful and are willing to take the time to guide you in the right direction.
good,Overall it Was a good Place to work for. Managment can be a little all over the place at times. but overall they try there best .good company to work for
good,Was a seasonal position. Employees treated me good. Worked with driver to ensure packages arrived in a timely manner for holiday season.
good,Placed workers in various positions and set up computerized tilt tray that sorted small packages for delivery. Observed and evaluated lifting techniques for safety measures. Plotted productivity on Excel spreed sheets. Made sure that Tilt Tray had good up time creating good productivity number. Supervised package audits. Making sure I met productivity goals was most enjoyable. Hardest part of job was working with Union employees.
good,"productive, high pace working environment. Working at UPS can be demanding at times."
good,A great company to join. Working as a pre-loader you will be asked to stand and lift heavy objects often. This position requires you to work well as an individual and with others.
good,This job doesn't pay enough for the labor nor provides enough hours per week but they do offer free benefits
good,"UPS is a good place to work for, but you must be willing to sacrifice personal time. You also must be willing to put in your time in order to gain seniority. I worked at UPS for ten years, and I still was not a full time seniority employee."
good,"i like the job , but alittle to stressfull , and no home time , too many hours at work . working 12 plus hours per day , i dont mind overtime but too much takes a toll on life an family ."
good,a typical day at work. learned how to sort boxes to the different locations. also learned how to load a truck the correct way.
good,Come to work and do a good job you can get recognized by the management in your area. I learned many things about the logistics of how this company worked. There was not a job that I did not do and upper management people also came and trained me to train other workers when their were new implementations to our system of packing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers that were dishonest and human resources would go after the employee instead of really trying to find out the truth. I enjoyed working as an employeed before I became a supervisor.
good,I like all the people i work with an like the job im just not getting enough hours in to support my family
good,One of the must well designed company of parcel services...
good,"This position offered the opportunity to work, lose weight, and it has great benefits"
good,"Integral part of a team of 30 – 40 sorters, responsible for organizing and routing as many as 150,000 parcels/shift."
good,"working at The UPS Store is a challenge of knowing all the different services they have to offer over ther years I have learned all of them. "
good,had to unload trucks i also was a sorter sorting packages after being unloaded sending them to their right docks to be loaded into trucks.also drove forlift when something was to be to carry .
good,"UPS is a organization opened now over 100 years. The economy has taken a toll on the company's volume but its revenue has not dropped. The typical day is hustle and bustle to get our consumers packages out, and on time. I have learned the different ethics of my co-workers and how they are different to each other. There is no hardest part of the job as I have learned it by now. The most enjoyable part of the job is when co-workers get along with each other. Management is on their job except when they do not check up on their supervisors which is the leader in my department."
good,scan and load packages in a truck that was very hot. About 110 degreas. Management constantly watching didn't see co-workers much. Hardest part was dealing with the hot temps. in the trucks.most enjoyable was break time.
good,UPS was a good place to work but I got paid very little for the work I did there and It takes too long to ever move up and get paid more. Overall my experience was fair
good,As a Supervisor I would come in to our pre-sort meeting which is about 15-20 minutes and go over what all we need to accomplish that day. Afterwards I head to the area I run and have a similar pre-sort meeting with my employees. Once the sort starts it's my job to make my employees as successful as possible by putting them in the right trucks to get the job done quickly while being safe. What I've learned is how to motivate people plus build and sustain professional relationships with them. I've also learned that management can be a rewarding job when you build the right culture in your workplace. The hardest part of job is being held accountable for thing outside your control. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is working as a team with co-workers and employees.
good,Ok place to be nice pay but u gotta be willing to work your fingers to the bone get dirty and take junk from the bosses (they call it motivation) other wise theres a lot of room for advancement and the work eviroment is pretty good.you unload trucks then go home one of the easiest jobs ever but you will work hard
good,"I usually open the store 3 days a week and work one entire Saturday every other week. I learned how to manage customer accounts. Accounts such as House accounts and personal mail boxes. I most importantly learned about packing and shipping for the customers. My co-workers are family members to the owner of the store. I get along really well with them because I am considered like family to them. The best part of the job can be easily seen as the worst part of the job sometimes. I like working with the family because we get along really well and are very close, yet sometimes being too close to a co-worker has its downfalls because like siblings we do have our disagreements."
good,"A typical shift includes safety observations, safety interviews, building inspections and audits, hazardous material control, data inputs, administrative and office duties, compliance and training, encouraging wellness and healthy living for our employees."
good,A typical day at work is about as difficult some but not bad. If you work the morning shift from about 4-8 or so then it's hard to get going sometimes but only until you get into the schedule. That is probably the hardest part other than the labor itself. The employees are great as well as a lot of the management and that is most enjoyable.
good,"Follow the processes and know your methods.  Accountability is the key.  Very High stress, especially if you are a minority there.  I am an Asian American.  .01 percent for PDALE HUB.  Easier target, but I was good at my job, made goals, many awards, but it didn't seem to matter to upper management, division manager level. I had flaws, but that was my challenge to improve.  Loved the job, couldn't stand the micro management from corporate who had no clue what a hub operation was, or how to operate.  Decided it was time to resign when the division manager starts insulting you and making you feel that you are worthless, after almost 10 years of hard work for the company."
good,Typical day at work was hard work and fast paced. I learned how to scan packages. Management is horrible. Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. Hardest park of the job is lifting up to 70 lbs continuously for 4 to 5 hours. The most enjoyable part was that they give you a week of vacation every year and they provide amazing medical benefits.
good,management is very unhelpful but very busy place to work at and co-workers are great. long drive.
good,This job I loaded trucks for the drivers. It was very repetitious every day. Also a very physical job. This company doesn't offer to much room to advance.
good,"The typical day as a loader at UPS consisted of five hours of none stop loading, with supervisors thinking the way to motivate you is to yell, and complain. Everyone is pretty much to their own self, and the only interactions are when you get backed out or moved to another trailer. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is the feeling of holding down your trailer. I learned that life is hard, and you have to start from somewhere in order to reach a goal, and honestly would of stayed if the pay was better."
good,A typical day at UPS is good. What I learn at UPS is to work in a fast pace to scan and properly load build a wall in a semi truck. The management at UPS is ok its like they know what they are doing and the co-workers is nice and helpful to help the new hirers to be successful. The hardest part of the job is working in the heat with some of the heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning more everyday about the UPS. 
good,"At UPS our task was to manually lift all kinds of boxes from light to really heavy boxes. It was a productive duty because we had to be lifting all day. The job involved lots of teamwork because of the different positions some workers were at. We had workers lifting boxes on to a conveyor belt Next, the boxes would go around and had other workers push them into their destination. After, we had others manually lift and build walls with the boxes in the trailers, At times it would get stressful cause we would get yelled at. I didn't like the way the job put me through because the boxes were really heavy to the point where we almost killed ourselves because of the harsh labor work. The most enjoyable part of the job was our breaks because we would actua;;y have some entertainment."
good,heavily top loaded - more people to manage than to do the actual work. 
good,"Its a good job not enough hours, people not showing up for work or there late. People was never on time to start the shift. "
good,"Unload inbound packages, load outbound packages."
good,"Holiday season is the busy time for UPS, and its non-stop business."
good,I learned alot about safety during my time there and  i enjoyed workin wit my coworkers . They have very strict rules but the shifts are very flexible only up to five hrs for parttime but only a ten min break. Involves alot of hard labor lifting up to 70lbs and however  the weather is outside it feels almost exactly the same there. Exampl : if its 70 degrees outside it will be about 80 inside and no air conditioning or if its 20 degrees it will be about 25 degrees no heat.
good,"Bagged groceries, scanned peoples groceries, use the cash register, cut up deli meats and push baskets."
good,"Its a very physical,fast paced job..care has to be taken when handeling others packages. "
good,We had to load the trucks and make sure the packages you were putting in the trailer were right 
good,"This is by far the best learning experience I have ever had, but there isn't much of a work/life balance."
good,Arrive 3am to sort freight and load to truck for delivery. Trucks scheduled to depart btwn 9 and 10 am. List of packages that had deviations would also be worked in conjunction with the deadline trucks had to depart timely. Depending on driver availability would then drive truck for delivery of freight usually ending early afternoon.
good,sorting packages that was unloaded from trucks.
good,easy everyday routine
good,This job was very demanding and very fast paced. the job was tireing and very stressful.
good,"hard work, in all types of weather elements. good benefits. terrible management"
good,Easy job sometimes boring. Just walk around doing your rounds.
good,i liked working there kept me on my feet all day. The people i worked with were fun people and i would like to maybe work there another day.
good,check in with your work card review yesterdays work threw the cameras. Hardest part was prob doing the auditing got a lil hectic sometimes favorite part coworkers made a hard day alot more easy everyone was really responsible and always made jokes which made the job more fun.
good,"A typical day at work started before the birds woke up, then it was rush rush rush. Very high paced."
good,part time loading 3-5 ups trucks
good,When ups bought overnight transportation in 2006 I had 12 yrs in with the company. They took the freight
good,Good company to work but employees are not recongnised for the work which is done.
good,The upper management make this job unpleasant. Everything else in the job is not that bad. The higher ups only push the numbers in management
good,"My day started at 2am in the morning to whenever we finished getting the trucks loaded. I learned what a fast paced company is all about.Managemen was tough because of the time sensitive packages that had to be delivered. Working with other employees was a must, we worked together to get the trucks loaded right for the driver. The hardest part of the the job was at Cristmas time when people would ship out alot of packages. the most enjyable part of the job was working with the other employees,"
good,It was great working the but the supervisors are stupid.i work Sunday thru Thursday and only 31/2 hours. The hardest was unloading the 53 foot trucks with no help.
good,If you like a fast pace environment and working by yourself with very early morning hours this is definitely a place for you to work.I enjoyed the hours because I was always home with my kids. It was a seasonal job that I took just for extra money for christmas.
good,"Come in do a daily PCM and get your route. Deliver packages come back. Got along with most management but didn't get alot of ""good jobs"", even though I did everything they asked and more exceptionally well. Got along with all my co-workers which is a rare thing for anyone to do in today's world. Hardest part of the job was the stress. Very long hours, everyday wondering if I would lose my job. If you had an accident it didn't matter if it was your fault or not you lost your job. The most enjoyable part was the job, I loved it even though it was stressful, and whats more is I was very good at it. At least thats what I was told by others."
good,Constant work. Management can be cool if you do your work. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting.
good,"A typical day at work is getting in earlier, setting everything up for my employees. Being in management has taught me patience. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the union and the most enjoyable part was my employees."
good,"You really have to find something you like about the job, or else you won't last long."
good,"• Answer questions regarding store and products, while maintaining knowledge of current sales and store promotions."
good,Treat employees well. Flexible work schedule. Fun meeting customers and building relationships
good,"typical day of work includes loading whites creek, the fastest flow truck on my dock."
good,"A typical day can be extremely hard physically, mentally and emotionally, and can swing both in a positive or negative way. It all depends on the people involved, but overall it was a rewarding time,because of the customers. I learned further discipline and how to manage time better. Management could be average, my co-workers were among some of the best people I have known since boot camp. The hardest part about it was excessive messaging during the course of the work day. The most enjoyable part is seeing someone receive a packaged and it's like Christmas in July,and the support from customers."
good,"Truck after truck after truck! Always prepared and ready to work, strive to be the best, good competiton between everyone."
good,I scanned packages and loaded them into semi tractor trailers. I learned to focus on haz-mat labels and ensure a stable load. My co-workers were very helpful when assistance was needed. The hardest part of the job was enduring the weather in the summer time. The most enjoyable was knowing that the trucks were being loaded on time ensuring an on time delivery.
good,"It was a good job great benefits, but was harrassed by management. management were very condescending and were backstabbers."
good,I like my job alot but i do wish they paid more the work is easy and the people are fun to work around
good,Hot and it was very hard work at early in the mornings. Extremly great benefits and retirement plan
good,"Good work, but it is hard and demanding. Long work hours at time, short at others, have to work a majority of hollidays and often times those are the days you work latest."
good,At UPS as a drivers helper i learned to be on time to meet deadlines with different companies and communication skills as well.
good,"Full time supervisors and upper management where terrible. Lost of favoritism. I really enjoyed my job, working with CBP and gateway employees. Great benefits and pay."
good,you work for 4 hour but you do 8hours of work with a 10 min break
good,"this job was a fast and fun place to work , the associates was all young guys that got along together and work was consistent but the hours was just 4-5 hours a day"
good,"Need newer managment training, to accomodate current young"
good,Work is ok after the 630 rush the rest of the day I smooth sailing my co workers are the best I made alot of new friends their is no hard part to the job because work is work thats what Im there for .
good,"I learned stacking boxes is way harder then it looks. The hardest part was having dust in your eyes in nose. A typical day at work is everyday, long and hard. I will load and unload trucks with packages the size of 180 lbs and the temperature of the trucks was about 95 degrees. The most enjoyable part is the Challenge with my co-workers."
good,I learned a great deal from this company that will lead me in the right direction into the future. I appreciate all the knowledge and skills I've obtained since working at the United Parcel Service.
good,"hard labor, hands-on job, require heavy- lifting, bending, sorting and transporting bulk packages"
good,I have worked for U.P.S. for 5 years now & its a good reliable job to have but it not always easy.
good,"the pay was great, however there went any hours available. id work here again if hours werent hard to come by"
good,Very stressful company although the people were great and the benefits were outstanding
good,Ups is a great company that instilled in me virtually every work ethic i possess today. It was a fast paced work environment that emphasized multitasking but safe work methods at all times.
good,People were not as friendly & was paid lower than I was told. Work was too fast paced for a certain amount of workers present. It was not a safe environment to work in due a lot of packages being on the floor because of how low workers there were
good,If your are looking to be a preloaded prepared to quit. As most do due to being overly worked and not compensated for hours of work or pay. Not only is it hard but you barely receive any help as others are always busy or aren't there.
good,"Ups was an alright job the only problem is that they like to keep hiring new people, and they replace the people that were already there, the way it starts is they start sending people home early and then in a few weeks they don’t need them anymore because they hire someone new"
good,Working at UPS has helped me learn new skills or adapt to different environments like working on a plane loading/unloading and sorting. The management at ups is great and so are the benefits
good,peak season which is for Christmas and with all the online shopping our work loads has been heavier over the years. and the company hires extra people to help out during this season.
good,Very good place to work for but they only call you when needed so sometimes you don't receive a call at all. You can't work more the 5 hours so that was no good
good,I like my job but UPS is very disorganized. They change your work schedule alot. And if you do a double shift take a picture of the paper in sign in and out of cause they dont always put it in the system and you have to bug them for your own money. Its a pain.
good,With flexible hours either working early in the morning or into the later evening ups has some great benefits for a second job. The work is not easy so be ready to get to work!
good,"Many people work here without a purpose. My purpose was to use the tuition assistance program and do part time work. Many come for the benefits, advancement, feeder work. If you want to work here, have a purpose because the work is very strenuous on your body for part time workers."
good,overall a great place but a lot of micromanaging I dont really feel the need to rate them as I was only there long enough to get a small feel overall its a good starter job for someone who wants to be in sales
good,I consider this “light work” because sometimes moving objects from one place to another or from one thing to another it can be difficult when your not used to doing it.
good,Helping UPS drivers deliver packages to all locations. Getting up early and leaving when you finished with deliveries. Most drivers organize the truck and packages before leaving the warehouse so everything is organized once we touch the delivery locations.
good,"I had a lot of moving around to do, It was a job that required a lot more physical labor rather than mental labor. I loaded for most of my time there, which required me going into cans and filing them up with boxes. I transferred to being an Inbound Shifter, which was, if anything, easier, just required paying attention, especially if I was put on TEK."
good,Every day is a new day with new deadlines that have to be met for all the packages to be deliver on the next day. I enjoying being part of the problem solving team that makes it happen.
good,UPS will work you and push you little by little until you reach your person max. making packages come faster and make you load faster and faster. it is better to be safe and work at ones own pace without pushing it.
good,"A typical day, you get there unload trailers by hand, very physically demanding job and you are exposed to the elements but its not too bad on the dock. Management seemed alright, more organized than most corporations, and the pay was decent. I got bored doing the same routine but its not a bad job."
good,"Fast paced during the peak season but generally ok."
good,Working at UPS be ready to work hard and earn every dollar you make it’s a great company with great benefits for medical and dental 41K plan a retirement
good,relaxed work place most management was a pleasure to work with . some supervisors can use some work on there people skills and professionalism . one supervisor was very rude and unprofessional and mad my work experience a little uncomfortable.
good,"- A typical day at UPS varies on the area you work for but overall this company requires it's employees to be very dedicated "
good,It was a very fast paced environment. I enjoyed my time working there but it took a toll on my body. I suggest working here for the school benefits and union benefits.
good,I pretty much helped a driver with packages that needed to be delivered to certain locations. There wasn't too much that was done so it was pretty much a simple job
good,I think the people are the best part of the organization and the only reason I haven't quit yet. The pay is okay and we travel a lot but the managers don't run you crazy and aren't unrealistic.
good,"A typical day at work is in come in say hey to the employees, ask then what you want me to and if I needed assistance the wouldn't mind. In my time in retail in never packaged baggage"
good,Check proper 5th wheel coupling I experience in shipping and receiving.I can audits and sort at a high rate.I'm involved in safety CHSP.I'm yard certified over 5 years...
good,"This job has the exercise and money you need , but the hours are some what lacking. They make sure you hydrate and have something cold to enjoy but mostly you will bring your own hydration"
good,Like I said it’s not like school so I have to work on my attendance which I’ve had started. The hardest part of the job is when the flow is going fast it’s hard to scan and load at the same time but we always find a way to clean it up
good,Multiple task is given through out the day. Usually just work your way down if your area is clean and work as a team until all the work is done or don't need as many employees on the clock.
good,Today start off fast paced it's easy and sometimes but most of the time some when it comes to heavy lifting you can be difficult but you get used to it you can learn a lot I working at UPS ticket farther youry career I can say that management is kinda organized kind of have to find a lot of things out by yourself at most times but didn't that once you get the hang of it it's pretty much easy workplace culture I will pass on that the hardest part about the job is waking up tell her being able to get up at 3 in the morning to be there till at 4 or until 8 or 9 that's the hardest part and I just wish they were paid the part-time workers more money than they are being paid.
good,You have to work hard at ups.What I learned at ups hard working Pays off and you have to drink alot of water so you won't get dehydrated and bring water bottles.
good,"If you are a package handler at UPS, you’ll get great benefits, excellent union protection, great pay and more. It’s hard work but you’re compensated well. However, if/when you’re offered a Supervisor Position, whether it’s Part Time or Full Time Operations Supervisor, it’s not worth it. Turn it down. Although the pay is great, manager benefits are top notch and you’re guaranteed 27.5/hours weekly, it’s not worth the stress of poor upper management, strict standards that are extreme even for the best employees and limited room for movement past that position. That being said, UPS is a wonderful environment to build a career in.. If you stay in the union."
good,It was very hard for me working for UPS I did it for a long time just so I don't be without a job but I'm only 123 lbs and I had to upload trailers and unload trailers it was just very hard on my body and I had no help.
good,Yeah the benefits are great and it’s a weekly check but the conditions and the quality of the work environments really make it what it is ;  a warehouse job. Overall a check is a check.
good,A typical day at work for me is to pull out all the bulk packages out of the trailers. I learned that it is very hard to find help when i really needed it. The hardest part of the job is moving packages that weigh over 160lb on my own. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work hours are very short.
good,"The location I worked at was very out of date. It hasn't been updated in terms of machinery or conveyor systems in almost 20 years. Not the safest place to work. I've been injured twice there over the 1 year that I worked. Other than that, the coworkers are all pretty good people and good to get along if you pull your wight."
good,"Very little pay for the amount of work that it’s expected. Good job for someone who goes to college and just needs extra money, or just finished high school and it’s your first job. Wouldn’t recommend it if you have a family"
good,"Pros "
good,"after being at ups for three years i really saw a decline.  turn over rate increased,  not nearly as much recognition, and expectations got way to high.  its a tough job you work really hard with to few employees."
good,This job is very demanding. There are minimum and maximums to be reached. Timelines and schedules to be completed as directed. No room for error! The compensation for Pay and benefits are great.
good,"Not a bad place to work.....no climate control, fast paced union company with little chance to become a full time warehouse associate, health, vision and dental are FREE!!!!"
good,"The most stressful job! Everyday I’ve contemplated if I will be there the next. Poor working conditions, With like 5 fans and you’re lucky if you can even feel it."
good,"This job is good for a part time thing, but if you're trying to make a career out of it you better have patience.  The waiting list on all the better jobs are long, at least 1 year"
good,No comment great job when I needed the money but worse job when I needed support. Management was horrible and ran all the great employees off including myself after over 2 years of dedication
good,Come in at 5pm swipe my ID badge. Then I get assigned a bay where I either unload the irreg truck or sort the truck. I rather prefer to unload the truck.
good,"very physically, fast and steady pace workplace can be dangerous if not following the safety guidelines, good benefits and the pay is ok, part time for the most part"
good,A typical day at UPS for me is showing up 30 minutes before the shift. Then I stretch and make sure I'm hydrated. Then i go in the truck and load at my pace. What I have learned at UPS is to have patience and disicpline. Over the years that I have been there I hae grown in both areas because both have been tested. I also learned you can handle business how you would handle things else where. The hardest part I would say about working at UPS is dealing with co workers and or management. Many people includes many different personalities so you never know what you're going to get. However the most enjoyable part I would say about UPS is moving at a fast pace. The intensity just releases a lot of stress.
good,"The UPS preload package handler job requires working early morning hours typically from 3 or 4 AM until around 8 or 9 AM.  The job requires a good deal of physical fitness and strength.  One must be able to lift at least around 70 lbs. of weight.  The work for truck loading is done along a continuous moving belt loading three trucks by number codes over approximately four hours.  The package loaders must place the assigned packages into their assigned trucks and also into their proper positions on each truck.  This requires good organizational skills with a high degree of accuracy.  Truck loaders are constantly evaluated on the quality and accuracy of their truck loading.  Too many mistakes can cause management to either move the person to another less demanding job or dismissal from the job.  Good lifting skills are taught and should be maintained to avoid injury.  The job requires almost continuous motion and standing for periods of four hours at a time.  At the end of the shift, very heavy packages called irregulars are sent down the belt to be loaded.  These packages can weigh up to 150 pounds and sometimes require assistance when loading.  Any misrouted packages are sent to their appropriate locations by the truck loader.  This is the overall description of a typical UPS truck loader.  It is probably one of the most demanding preload positions at UPS along with truck unloading.  UPS offers weekly paychecks, paid major holidays after working one year, health insurance via the Teamsters Union after one year.  Teamster Union membership is not required in Virginia to receive"
good,Work really hard with no appreciation. Put in difficult positions while being yelled at for everything. Management tried to get away with no break most of the time.
good,"This would be a really great job is management wasn’t so horrible. "
good,It's nothing hard about the job. It is very chill at work every works sometimes laugh an etc it's just a normal day of work. Lunch breaks are good they give u 30 minutes everyday. I was on part time an it was a good part time job honestly th
good,"It's TRUE they want 8hrs of work in 4 or less hrs.  Regardless of load size. Benefits are good. But a very fast paced and sometimes stressful. Low pay scale, there is not a union book or specific operating gudlide available it's all ask a manager. Like they dont lie"
good,Empresa com uma forte cultura corporativa e com foco global. Busca constante por novas tecnologias dentro da área de logística. Precisa de atualização nas rotinas profissionais dentro do departamento comercial e inovação de processos em gestão. Muito potencial para crescimento no Brasil.
good,I did not enjoy working for UPS because to move up takes years and my pay rate wasn’t fair to the amount of time I could’ve wasted working there just to move up.
good,Overall the job pays well for only 5 hours of work. But the poor management almost makes the money not worth doing the job. Add that with having to work really fast and you have an overall bad experience. My time at UPS has not been a good one. You can't really count on anyone to help you if you need it and no one ever tells you anything. You have to figure it out on your own and they get mad or look at you like your stuoid if you do something wrong or don't go fast enough. But if you go to fast you will end up hurting yourself and tire your self out before the day is even done.
good,"It was okay. I liked it. Fast pace job. There was a UNION, why rich it was good. The supervisor wasn't to good. The other employees were good. It was a team work."
good,Strong will determination and drive is required to succeed. This isn't a job for the faint of heart many people quit within the first week. The job itself is decent enough as long as you have the will power to stick it through.
good,"UPS is a very fast hot environment to work in and gets a bit frustrating but UPS  have tons of opportunities , growth and benefits ."
good,"Ups is a very fast paced job a little too fast paced for the amount of money you make. Since the work is so fast its very difficult to make hours within the job. I've had no problems with any co workers, supervisors, mangers etc, but the job itself is very stressful and puts a huge tole on your body."
good,"Would be a very tough job to stick with for a long time unless moved up to a higher, less physically demanding position. Not to mention the lack of communication between employees due to overworking."
good,I loved working at ups for the 2years I was there and wish I could go back........very serious job considering it's a government paying job....its a good life to some
good,"it was fun working there i honestly would go back for my reasons the pay rate wasn't worth the risk, and  management was low but the made do security was good work days where to slow and fast hard to explain but we would only have 1-2 flights a day maybe 3 during the holidays was the best though alot of work get your full hours it was great"
good,I would HIGHLY recommend working at UPS because it gives EXCELLENT benefits and sometimes discounts at the UPS websites. During Christmas time you can get ALOT of overtime.
good,"It is a job that will challenge you mentally and physically and if you are fond of challenges and hard work this job is the right job for you. It also gives out amazing benefits, would highly recommend this job to a family or a family member."
good,"Expect to stay busy working! Team motivated mindset, with upward mobility goals of advancement. Dress for the weather and stay hydrated! Learn as you go."
good,Short hours but other then that great place to releave stress. Its union always had your back and kept ur job secure but trying to stay 3 hrs a night was the hard part there for no money
good,UPS is good for any type of employment full time or part time or temporary you have opportunities to grow if you decide to stick with ups as a full time employee
good,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I've worked at customer service for this place for 5 years dealing with everything from stolen packages or all out fights with UPS drivers and I can tell you that it has pro's and con's. "
good,I liked the job and everybody I worked with were cool people but the hours were horrible no more then 12 hours a week I was even lucky to get 20 hours a week. Good benefits
good,Very low pay considering the time of day you work. Average of 3-4 hours of work a day for a package handler. However it is one of the few work places that are felony friendly and not as punctual about dressing. And within a matter of months you can be promoted to management or driving.
good,"It was a cool job, just low pay. A typical day at work was going in getting the job done and leaving. I learned warehouse safety rules. Management was ok,i never had a problem with them because i stay out the way, but i did see others argue, and have problems with management. The hardest part of the job i would say is moving the irreg packages. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you see the last couple of boxes coming down the belt, and I know its almost time to go home. Its hard labor for little pay."
good,"Some supervisor are young. They  want you to work like you are young. Now that I am older. I hate working there. 20 years in ready to retire. I have my CDL. Tried to go to feeders, they tell me I have to drive packages trucks for a year. Not trying to sit on my license for a year."
good,Was a good place to work they had great benefits but low hours great people that work with you and great managers that help you when you needed it at work and if you needed medical assistance they were right there to help
good,Constantly revolving with technology. Like all companies you have those that are faithful and fair however you also have those that do whatever it takes to benefit themselves and abuse their authority
good,A good part time job and has many perks. Very stable and you will always have a job as long as you show up to work. The management here is no very good. The supervisors are constantly watching your every move because most of the are just out of high school and power hungry.
good,Very fast paced environment but people in the warehouse are treated poorly and aren’t being paid enough for their work. You could see benefits if you end up staying a while.
good,Management was very helpful with training for this position. It's a typical fast paced warehouse job with a lot going on. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and my least favorite was the hours.
good,In Jacksonville fl. You wont get many hours at all my shift is 2 to 3 hours seriously. Your not eligible for the free insurance until a yr of employment
good,"The job was fun and relaxed (when I first started). The driver explained everything, and we delivered everything together, even if I was a small box. (He always went with me to deliver because sometimes the customers wanted us to pick up packages that needed to be shipped elsewhere). I got assigned to another driver 2 weeks later and he made the job so much harder than it should be. He made me carry/deliver every package alone, while he stayed in the truck and ate chips and candy. Some of the boxes were extremely heavy and needed to be lifted as a team but he insisted I drag it uphill, alone, and deliver it myself. The customers were very nice and kind, they always had snacks sitting by there door. They always greeted me, offered me snacks, and gave thanks for my hardwork (something my driver never did). Overall the managers were nice and the customers made my job worth it. Otherwise, I probably would have quit my job due to my driver."
good,decent place to work everyone was nice  boss was really good got really cold in the winter rime and really dusty there definitely recommend it nights started at difrent times
good,"working at UPS was a job I enjoyed thoroughly, I enjoyed how physical the job was and all of the staff/coworkers were incredibly friendly, caring, and helpful."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, hard and strenuous work, short breaks, great insurance, STRICT management, inconsistent work hours for part time overnight or first shift."
good,a typical day at work for me would be to drive all the way to UPS in mississauga. then i would pretty much help my driver with taking packages to peoples homes all day and delivering which was good.
good,The warehouse I worked at was very inefficient but will soon be automated. Tuition reimbursement was a big big plus and other discounts were great too. but prepared to work REALLy hard
good,"Its an OK job but difficult. Some teams support you while others do not offer support at all. I never felt supported at this job, its very difficult ."
good,Great place to work; at my Hub the management isn’t too bright . They don’t follow the rules that they train you to learn. They are too easy on co-workers that show up late or are lazy workers and I feel very unappreciated at work
good,Working at UPS as a package handler was very physically demanding. working full time is very difficult although I received an hour break it takes a toll on you.
good,They have no respect for family or your well being. They tell you one thing when it comes to advancing but as time goes by they take the opportunity away. They have no respect for their employees and no recognition of everyday accomplishments.
good,"Depends on a lot of factors but you get paid decent. The problem is that there is no real training. You just learn as you go. "
good,the job is good but UPS is very under paid. A new contract is under way but no results as of yet. The job is ok but it hard work and then you have to deal with the attitudes that are sometimes very difficult to deal with.
good,a typical day at ups is a very fast pace work environment supervisor are always on point . I learned time management . the hardest part is keep every thing an order
good,"P/T Seasonal. It wasn't bad. Good extra money. People work hard. Drivers make good money. Union for most. Fast paced environment, changes happen with out notice."
good,"a typical day at work would start at 9:00 am with helping your loader to load your truck and making sure you organize the packages according to their numbers, after that you're rushed out and tracked every single step of the way until you make it back to the hub."
good,"I worked there during the month of august therefore there wasn't very many people around. I felt slightly inadequate, everyone was quite old and I wasn't able to speak to very many people."
good,Not enough hours. If its not peek season you will have to wake up at 2am to go to work for 3-4 hours. The pay was good but never got enough hours to tell
good,"Very fast pasted job with lots of benefits, sometimes no breaks.   Paid Vacation and Personal Sick days one paid week off a year when ever you would like to take it and if you don’t use it by the end of the year you get paid time and a half for it 1.5x ."
good,"A typical work day includes 4 hours of unloading a trailer at a fast pace, or loading trucks I also sorted packages to right destination, clean up work area and lift heavy packages up to 150lbs."
good,"Best part time job out there, honestly. Even better if you're looking to pay for school. The union doesn't do much besides job security and you must wait a year for health benefits... but the health benefits are better than most companies and is included with the small union due. You will be overworked in a small period of time, though. This creates a pretty negative culture. Plenty of opportunities to get paid more if you're one of the lucky employees to be selected. If not, you will be subjected to repetitive, physically demanding labor that doesn't even cover the cost of gas... unless you're lucky enough to be selected to get the bonuses offered to most new hires. Even with all that negativity, this job can eventually compensate better than jobs requiring years of experience and education."
good,"Poor management, hard labor fast paced working environment can be competitive at times with fellow workers but that’s rare. If you’re just looking to stay part time go find another job"
good,"All employees start out at the bottom as a part timer in which very few will make it. Turn over is very high due to short staffing, extreme weather conditions and the fact that the job is extremely physical in nature. If you put in the work and make it through the low pay, low hours and grunt work, you can advance through seniority in about 5-7 years. Driver positions are just as hard and demanding but the pay and benefits are unbeatable."
good,It's a great opportunity if you are looking to work your way up to a promotion but not as a permanent job or somewhere to be for mor than a year. This job can really wear you down physically after a while
good,Ups was a great place to work I had payed time and benefits. I growed from a shipper to a leader. When I had my daughter I had payed time off. I had a great time working their I wish to find another place like it.
good,A typical day show up to work and you will either be loading/unloading a semi or loading a smaller package delivery truck.  A physical job you need to be in decent shape to as it is a very fast pace position.  If you stick around long enough there is room for advancement.  Great company benefits but upper management comes out of the office and yells at the supervisors and in turn the supervisors yell at the laborers.  Not a good environment for everyone.  You have to have some thick skin to deal with being humiliated at any given time.
good,"To be make good money, highly recommend to be hourly employee. Demanding as Management especially as PT Supervisor and advancement only comes when someone retire or transfer. Hard physical work."
good,"A day at UPS is getting to work trying to find a parking spot. After you have parked you have to get cleared by security in order to proceed to enter the building. As you are walking in the building  you go try and clock-in if you have no problems with the computer and screen being up or for those who have to wait on their supervisor to retrieve a time card to swipe to clock-in.  Once that is done you go set up your station and or any equipment needed to help you perform your job task. I think UPS is a great company to work for either part-time or full time. However, I've learned its not much full-time position(s) available other than just as a full-time driver. I wish they had better advancement opportunities for employees other than the option for a part-time supervisor. Some or most employees would rather not advance to management because they would lose the better benefits they have as an employee as well as not get compensated for any over time they work. The hardest part of the job is not getting the hours and or pay that should be guaranteed to you. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting those guaranteed hours without your time being messed up, and being able to clock-out with no complaints or injuries."
good,"Decent company to work for if you don't mind putting in the work."
good,They expect a lot out of you for little pay. The supervisors talk to you any kind of way and the management is terrible. They change supervisors like people change clothes.
good,"I loved working at UPS. Everyone works together and get the job done efficiently.  Although it is face paced and sometimes can be overwhelming, with heavy flow and packages, it's a good workout."
good,"High Paced work environment. The hours were early and at times difficult, but a welcomed challenge. Some staff were very helpful and willing to work as a team."
good,"I'm glad that I got to have the job experience, but i think that UPS was not the job for me. Everyday the trucks would be 10 degrees hotter than it was outside and one day it was 108 degrees outside so it was getting really hot and i was very thirsty so i kept drinking my water. After the first hour I threw up 3 times and this was the first time i had done something like this in my 5 months of working here. I asked if i could take a break and they said no keep working. Later that day i asked for my 2 week notice."
good,"Can get tiring and stressful during peak season. After peak season is over everything is normal or slow paced. If there's not enough work you can be sent home early or asked not to come in, if you are a new worker."
good,Just looking for higher pay but I sort pull bags of mail and throw on belt to the take away belt I load and unload and workout at the same time the mangers are pretty fair and good people
good,factory environment. it is a union so there can be tensions between management and employees. objectives are never met or strived for. full time managers only care about themselves. in order to get promoted its all about who you know.
good,"Arive at work, set up area by getting supplies ready and getting body streatched. Start processing any items left from the night before, then start processing the packages as needed when they come down the belt. Whenever there is any time when nothing is comming down either catch up or assist others in the area to help them catch up. Continue to work as fast pace until brake, then take 10 minute brake then finish work that is comming down belt. After regular items are finished make sure everything in work area is clean, call customers if needed, and move packages that are left for will call, future, or that or being held to the correct locations. Then assist in other areas as needed like bagging up small bags, assisting with customers, or locating packages for customers until time to leave."
good,"Its a ok job its just every shift there is part time you have to work two shifts to see money, and due to production thats a lot of strain on the body."
good,I enjoyed it but did not want to stay in that region the rest of my life. Once a driver you can not relocate. A typical day at work is very stressful and always long. You never know what time you will be off at but the money is great.
good,"LEs évolutions de carriéres chez UPS sont trés fréquent et il y a une possibilité de changer de poste facilement, même pour un poste auquel vous n'êtes pas attitré."
good,ups is a good place to work but its hard work good good good good you get a 10 minute break that's it you can work different shifts for a 24 hour span
good,Ups is fast pace and a lot of work if you’re into that kind of work it’s perfect for you if not I suggest try somewhere else. The supervisors are helpful but when things get crazy it gets stressful and hard to work
good,"Lots of money to be made, but with money comes a lot of people that want that money. Union made life as a supervisor challenging was fun at first but it gets old just people trying to make money off supervisors actually trying to help their employees. Not your average supervisor job in the Baldwin Park HUB expect to have to go the extra mile everyday."
good,It was very fast paced and the managers treated me like part of the family. The hardest part was meeting the required speed they needed for unloading.
good,It was just to much work for little pay the work was normal work but you did busy ur butt more then what you should be paid for tho it's unloading in a hot truck all night
good,"Working at UPS is a physical Challenge to work in, lifting and stacking packages is a tough job, and must be carefully stacked according to weight and content. however it is also a good place to work for the weekly salary and the benefits for an easier life payments/ retirements and more."
good,"( part-time, weekly checks)If you are planning to work in Commerce city Denver hub as a loader. Be warned. You will be moving at a pace or you can get stuck into the trailer loading boxes and have to go back and forth breaking jams that make the boxes just fall on both sides of the trailer because too many boxes are already in your chute. Picking up those boxes that are in your egress can be a pain. going at a pace keeps you sane and your area clean. The equipment in the trailers is usually what they call ""rollers"" and the rollers occasionally send five or four boxes at a time before getting caught or having the box just fall off before it gets off the chute. The equipment could be better if it was just repaired. Some are missing a tab which keeps the overflow of boxes to a minimum. This is bad because Boxes fall onto the rollers quickly depending on the number and weight of the boxes if the tab is missing the boxes will come flying into you if you're not cautious but this is rarely happening because The rollers are missing some of the parts. It can get caught in between the rolling bars but mostly gets cluttered by the chutes. If you have rollers though. The electric conveyor belt that you have in some areas is better but some don't extend long and drop to the floor which makes you think it might break. depending on the area you can have a ton of boxes some of the days you're there or bad management and you are being sent to clean someone else's work you can get stuck with boxes each night. Now the people like to talk (insert word) depending on the area and leave without finishing"
good,"I think that ups is a good job because you are lifting boxes 24/7, it’s a good exercise and will get you in shape very quick I suggest this job to all of my friends."
good,"Managment is horrible, nobody is on the same page, you working as a slave, Fast, Get it right or you’re out, and safely (or you’re out as well) They treat employees like idiots, supervisors dont do a thing, very low hours per day (starting), if you are 21 you can drive and make great cash but you have to be high senority, and its very harsh and cut throat to get in, and IF you are in you still start with the worst routes and hours and you’re work is never done you are their little “errand boy” but like me starting here at 19 i had at LEAST 2 years to sit by and wait to MAYBE drive handling heavy packages, very fast paced and correctly. You handle some crazy situations for around min wage and i used to work at a gas station getting min wage, 40hrs a week for doing pretty much nothing."
good,This is a great job if your looking for top industrial type work. They promote from within and give you the tools to succeed. Downfall with being in management is having to deal with the union and even if as a manager you follow all the protocols and steps in coaching an employee and is decided to let an employee go the union in every case I have observed got that employees job back. The union protects the bad employees and as a manager we take the blame. Work Life balance isn't the best. Yes you get paid really well but you will work anywhere from 12 to 14 hours every day and you are salary so no overtime.
good,"Very hot in summer time. Always a workout, full time benefits after 1 year. Raises every year depending on contract. Alot of positions to move from, part time early morning and twilight shift."
good,"A typical day at UPS is busy. There is always enough work to keep one busy. I have concepts of Accounts Payable. The Management staff at UPS is laid-back and easy to work for. The workplace culture varies. Like any place of employment, there are good days and not so good days. As a contract worker, we are giving tasks that no one else wants to do. Training can be better. The hardest part of the job is getting proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job is the hours, the pay isn't bad, some holidays off, and sometimes the offer of over-time."
good,"I've enjoyed working with UPS Freight. I've worked in different departments due to facing layoffs because of my job position ending yet, I've learned a lot working in various departments such as Human Resources, Legal, Urgent Services, Finance and Fleet but, at the same time it has be quite stressful as I need more stability and wanting to retire someday."
good,This job off great part time hours on minimal pay but flexible shifts. The college benefits are offered from day 1 and are great for younger people looking to advance.
good,"I worked as a delivery helped, which meant that I rode in the passenger seat on one of the big brown trucks, helping to deliver packages alongside the driver himself. This was a seasonal job during the holiday season in Idaho, so I was battling the elements (cold, snow, etc.) My driver was a great guy though. I worked a lot, worked hard, and my work/life balanced suffered considerably. But the job was only temporary, so it wasn't that big of a deal."
good,The labor is not worth the money we work from 4am -8 am letting packages with a 10 minute break and only get paid 11 an hour. With no paid breaks. Also management is unfair and rude .
good,Long hours and no work life balance.  Management varies across the board but ultimately it is required to meet all business goals.  Fast paced work environment; Management is paid very well.
good,"Breaks was short but when working fast in a cold warehouse in the winter , you do get hot after a while of working .. Working at Ups was a good workout for your body and you had to move fast and work slow or everybody else will be slow also. Managers was Nice and Strict . Managers do keep a eye out om everyone working ."
good,"Typical Day:  Always busy, even on a 'slow' day"
good,"early mornings and late nights.the job is pretty simple,mostly common sense.deliver the packages to the specific address.the hardest part of the job was scanning the packages."
good,I had arrived at a bad time I think. The company just switched ownership and changes were being made. The store I was stationed at needed to be run by one person daily. Not easy for a new start.
good,"This was a day by day grind type of job, it was physical and mentally frustrating to interact with some fellow employees who perform  lower than the minimum required."
good,"UPS is not a normal job. Everyday, you'll encounter something new in the aspect of employees telling you stories why they cant come into work to the equipment malfunctioning at the worst moments. There's a variety of characters that work there and they make working at UPS a bit more enjoyable."
good,you need to be able to lift 80 + pounds and at a high speed do not recommend to people who are lazy or weak. make sure you dont callwith in the 1st month or will be fired on spot
good,"Seats were very uncomfortable in the truck which makes it even harder for physical labor to be carried out. For a shipping provider receiving a lot of business during the holiday season the pay was terrible. The job has a 50% quit rate and you are required to sit through a number of meetings just to take packages on and off a truck. Getting the check was a hassle, I did like the driver that I worked with but the organization of the management was terrible."
good,"Overall great place, can't complain about what I did. They were nice, but stern as well. If you came in and did what you needed to do, nothing was said. But if you decided to slack off they would let you know."
good,The work is hard but you are well compensated. There is an incredible amount of hooking and unhooking from semi trucks. The facilities are very dingy and the supervisors are over focused on safety to the point of redundancy.I had noticed most drivers and other employees are sociable and happy in their jobs
good,"Working at UPS wasn't bad at all. We didn't get enough hours to make a living, but its a great company to grow from and it's easy to move up in the company. I left because I need full time and better benefits. However I overall enjoyed working there."
good,"UPS was a very good work experienced, I met and talked to a lot of different people along the way. Great exercise always kept me active and fit. Nice management and staff."
good,It was very fast paced sometimes very stressful job. A typical day included coming a hour before shift started to get paperwork and have meeting with sort manager. Then getting on warehouse floor to ensure my employees where prepared and had the proper tools to start the day off. Usually working for 5 to 6 hours straight with a 10 minute break. The management was all right though constantly changing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the Union when trying to discipline employees for not properly doing there job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the getting to interact with people on a day to day basis.
good,Handed out radios and scanner's for each supervisor. I went in at midnight and would work til 4am. Very easy job that anyone could do. I was working this job and working for the Dallas Cowboys part time seasonal as a beverage expeditor.
good,hard physical labor. management was tough on us but were good with logistics and thorough. They always gave us time off when we needed it. a great workout as well.
good,"As a Package Handler it was a great job, my supervisors were great the work was great the pay was good."
good,I was a very demanding job requiring both your time and your energy to preform. I worked monday to saturrday from as early as 11 till 11 at night. This job required a lot of physical ability that i recommend you make sure you can handle before you apply.
good,"Tues-Fri Normally go in at around 5am and leave around 9am"
good,"This has been an exciting job and operation to be a part of. I feel I am quite overqualified for what my potential shows, however. This job is very physical! Lots of bumps and bruises, but nonetheless the kind of work you can be proud of doing at the end of the day."
good,The HR professional was very helpful and kind. She tried to get a suitable place and also made the whole process very easy. My colleagues (the drivers I worked with) were awesome people and always eager to help. Great relationship with those guys.
good,"The job does have a wage progression schedule and a union, as well as benefits. It is only part-time so it's best to have another job or being enrolled in some kind of post-secondary."
good,Although being one of the most sought after jobs in the delivery industry UPS is a numbers driven company that cares way more about their production numbers than they do about their employees. Sadly the few supervisors that actually care about their employees are swiftly moved to another location.
good,"a very lucrative experience i have learned a new recruiting techniques, also very organized place in-spite of the high volume, great team, management was very professional passionate"
good,Great job security and opportunities to advance in company. The company focuses on promoting from within. Pay is ok but provide great benefits. Work hours can be frustrating
good,"Average day at UPS as a day time package handler can start at any time they post. this means one day you may start as early as 10 am or as late as 1:35 pm another day.An average work day will last about 4-5 hours on the off season and during the holiday rush near the end of the year will go up to 7 and a half hours per day. you will be expected to be able to handle a work flow of 1,000 packages an hour at the minimum and those packages will range on average of 20 lbs up to 155 lbs. Most times you will be working alone so you really need to be self motivated to get the job done. Understand that you will go through training on how all equipment works in the ups loading docks along with the proper way to lift packages. you will also go through all safety protocols, this includes not only hazmat protocols for leaking/damaged packages but also weather and fire emergency protocols. Management tends to keep to themselves as long as you are working hard other wise they will frequently check up on you."
good,What I experienced was a lot of favoritism and you have to know someone to get any advancement in the company. Benefits are very good and pay is fair.
good,"Use to be a great company but now it is nowhere need the same, if  you get in, make a plan school or driving or p.e or just get out. Very stressful at time mainly at peak season, but far from an easy job, the only easy days might be Wednesday or Friday."
good,a typical day at work at ups was hot kind of like a workout. Everyday we practiced safe. The management was good i never had a problem with the management. The hardest part about the job was how hot it could ge in the trucks.
good,"This place is nice, yes you might hate the hard work but some see it as getting paid to work out. With that said yes it can be stressful but by the end of the day you put in a hard days work and have the whole day to yourself."
good,"Typically within a day, you will just have to schedule a pickup and answer inquiry about deliveries and also help customer how to use the website for their self serve needs."
good,"I worked their because they paid for my education, unfortunately I worked 3rd shift so it was hard to balance life school and 2 other jobs (not including this one). The job is a little stressful on your body but I am ""5'2 and 130 lbs and managed/ managing to push through what may seem like long nights. Make sure you have headphones and snacks for lunch."
good,Fast paces. Hard working environment. Good benefits. Just takes long time to make some money and to become a driver. Ups is the type of job thats hard on your body.
good,"productive fun and fast place with hot temperature"
good,This job was alright to place work but it was fun to me i had chaces to meet other people and work hard to improve. I went to keep to keep my self in shape that job was for me to keep my strength up.
good,UPS is a fast paced work place where lifting heavy objects are a necessary skill. Working in a quick and timely manner is a plus when dealing with a crunch time schedule.
good,"As a driver helper your job is almost the same as the primary driver. Sort, scan and deliver packages to homes and businesses. Fast paced drop off service to your door or p.o. box"
good,Ups was not that bad but i did not like the way they lost and or help checks they just stuck us in any position .  Ups had slot of older men hitting on me . I also did not receive the proper training i just made a way . Some supervisors were really mean and had attitudes every night
good,"Nice place to work if you would like to become a driver or the insurance. If you stay part time, you will have to have a full time job else where. Keeps you in shape"
good,"UPS is a good job to work at only if u have a permanent work spot to stay at everyday. Most people that work at UPS don’t so they just keep getting moved around to different locations in the building, or the supervisor will send them home no matter how long you’ve been there."
good,"All I’m all, working at UPS has taught me to really appreciate working inside because here, you must get use to working in all kinds of weather conditions, whether it be cold or hot. You must be physically able to pick up boxes that weigh ugh to 70 lbs. by yourself, therefore, you must have some strength before entering this job."
good,"Its a good job to work at , it just depends on where you work in the hub. Some places are overwhelming but others are great spots to work at. The opportunities to move up there are great."
good,A fast-paced work environment that offers great benefits and a secured life-long career with a 401k plan. This is a good job if you are starting off and wants something to add to your resume if you don't have much work experience.
good,Sehr gutes Arbeitsklima freundliche Mitarbeiter sehr gute Bezahlung
good,If you’re ready to be on your feet hand in hand then this is a great job. I was fit an ready for the day to begin delivering packages. You must be willing to work hard and smart at the same time. Great drivers
good,"Learn Package and Handling, Organization. You are always kept busy. Time goes by fast when you working hard. All sorts of package to handle and process. Safety is key"
good,"a typical day at ups would be a lot of work fast pace."
good,"The work is not too hard you figure it out usually the first few days. But it does get annoying with certain packages. The hours are ok, it’s not too bad, but if I get a better opportunity I wouldn’t mind leaving."
good,I had a chance to fulfill my family dreams I had been working at  ups for a short time but I liked it there cause it's a good place to stArt out a family but in times I had my wife and daughter sent to kona so I'm willing to be with them
good,I worked nights at the commerce city warehouse. It's an interesting crowd of mainly guys. The work environment is dirty and either mostly hot or cold while working in the trailers.
good,I like it they pay me weekly the only problems where dealing with being there and enjoying working there after a while I hated it because it just becomes a lot
good,"job not very hard but breaks are short. Learn how to loaded boxes, fun managers. and the hardest thing about UPS is probably peak season and the enjoyable is the pay for peak season."
good,"You can make good money at this company it was just now what I was happy with. You could pick your own hours, morning, afternoon, evening. Great place to work for college students."
good,"No moral, no teamwork, not a proactive place to work, no work ethnics.   Lack of communication.. This company does get involved in community volunteers but not this specific terminal.  Unfortunately, there is no teamwork here.  What is great is that we can still get involved through the UPSers website and interact with other workers from around the world.   We can also volunteer in community events and log on our times on the website and get acknowledged for the work done."
good,"Driver Helper was fun, safe, learning experience,Gatewa was like a playground with no respect or manners picking favorites to do certain jobs no coordination for getting help for others supervisor dont educate when in need of benfits to be used so much drama and gossip that is uncomfortalbe to want to be at work."
good,"When I worked for UPS As a Delivery Driver Helper. I was put in for a seasonal position with them. My job was to be driven to every home by my driver or any location, run off the truck and deliver the package. When I was done, run back to the vehicle and proceed to deliver the rest of the packages repeating the same process until we were done with all of the packages for the day. On a daily basis, we would deliver about 70 to 100 packages. It was a nice job. But some things could have been better. I've always loved working with people so I got along very well with my driver, his name was Paul. I never had any problems with him. Unfortunately, they laid me off after the season was over. I was a very good worker and I smiled all the time and gave my best so I did not have a problem with that. Working for UPS was a good experience. I learned a lot of things delivering packages. My overall rate working for them would be a 4 out of 5 though. From personal Experience. The Benefits and Pay are very good but the management is below average and the associates are treated somewhat poorly. Don't take my word for it... Ask a driver. At least that's how it is here in Florida Fort Myers."
good,I worked the sunrise shift 3am to 8am you start by loading packages up to 50 lbs onto the trucks nonstop that you pull from your color coded ben if you get bulk packages you don't load them and someone else gets them and place them in a different truck.
good,I have always went above and beyond. My day start with organizing and preparing and dispatching paper work. I am the support function which prepares the team throughout the day
good,not to much to say great place to work. lot of young kids kinda of high school things going on around there. nothing harmful lol i enjoyed my experience there.
good,I have been working with UPS for couple of years. The overall working environment Is good and job security with this company is one of the biggest perks.
good,"I enjoyed working there. My typical work day consist of  sorting and packing , shipping  receiving parcels."
good,i would stock and unstock items on and off a company truck. The work was very hard labor and it was not paying enough for what they was asking from their workers.
good,i really liked working there at first until the management acted like i didn't know how to do my job. i was there for 7 months they always sent the guys home and i was the only female there and i was left doing all the work.
good,"Fast paced, challenging, unpredictable.  I learned to be creative and stern but fair.  The hardest part of my job was working with limited equipment and limited personnel for my department.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my drivers each day."
good,UPS is a great place to work depending on your age. It all starts off as part-time with times to pick up more hours. Low pay for new comers but good pay if promoted. Great job if your going to college they love that. Its hard physical work but ok if you pace yourself. Your open to the elements so expect to layer in the winter. They recognize people with UPS gear and food on the regular. Nothing but a relaxed environment instead of stuck up professional.
good,"I was a helper but I got to be a helper for my dad so it was fun that way. However its gets very boring and cold. And the work is very tiring. Also, you could get put with any random driver."
good,come in and get straight to work your manger tells you if you are scanning or bagging packages that particular day sometimes had to go out and collect bags or once you site was clear had to help clear other sites
good,"A typical day at work is stressful or sometimes nice and easy. It all depends on who is a manager at the moment and how much work will come. I've learned while working at UPS that I should paste my self and not work too hard because if I do I will be doing 10x more work than my co-workers due to the fact that some managers will believe I work fast enough to do all the work. IT depends on who is the manager, some managers will be unfair as I pointed out in the sentence above and will have one individual breaking their back doing all of the work. The workplace culture isn't too bad, people there are nice and welcoming. The hardest part of the Job is picking up boxes 100 pounds and up. Most enjoyable part of the job will have to be talking to co-workers."
good,It was a fun friendly environment working with coworkers. The hours weren't the best ive ever had (3am-9am) but it sort of worked well with school. Fast paced so no real down time to be bored
good,Ups isnt a bad place to work but it can be very stressful and alot on your body. I would not refer thi job to  someone who doesnt like fast pace work and like more of a relaxed setting
good,In Texas City the UPS building it rather small. packages come down a conveyor belt and you grab the ones for your truck and load them according to address. The objective is to make the driver's day as easy as possible.
good,The day consisted of calling current accounts and trying to on board new leads.  Repetitive day but coworkers bonded well.  Management was helpful when tough client situations arised.
good,"A typical day on the job here is complete duty.You better be ready to work if not you won't last very long.It is never the better place to have a secure job a secure future for you and your kids,but never the less they are going to make you work for every last cent."
good,"Low hours, low expectation, low pay and but great benefits if used properly. If you want a job that is money focused this is not the place to be. you will on average get a 200 dollar pay check for a 5 day week."
good,If your looking for part time job while in school i recommed joining UPS if your like me and now have a degree then i would look in your career field. The hours are not the same week to week so it becomes hard to figure out how much take home pay you will get. The work can be exausting moving packages and the wearhouse is not air conditioned so it becomes very hot and stickey
good,"Union jobs include tough manual labor. If you're not okay with that, don't even think about applying here. Upper management can be a pain, they don't always understand how tough it is as they care more about their money than your safety. Part time supervisors are typically pretty great, didn't have many complaints. Extremely easy to move up inside company. Great benefits, especially for newly weds and college students."
good,Ups is a good place to work and have great benefits. You have to go to work ready to be apart of the team. With there not good team work it makes everyone job harder. Always look forward to moving up in the company and raises. Safety is very important in working for ups and being on time as well. Good work ethics always helps yourself and others.
good,"Your work as hard as you will ever in your life, but you will be compensated for it. Management is both good and bad....either way you have to work hard. If you get a good boss its not too bad. If you get a bad one it can be tough."
good,It was a good first job just the pay and hours wasn't enough for the labor to me but it makes a great side job but overall a good company and it can pay off in the long run
good,It's a good company too work for if you are looking for a part time job. Don't train well but I'm a hands on person anyways. But the manager are very nice and professional
good,"Clear performance based reviews"
good,Load unload cargo Plans also trucks. The pay is not good its a hard job. But the benefits are GREAT. The people that work there are pretty mean and bi polar most of the time.
good,Enjoyed my time with different management around as it's a big corporation there are different rules and regulations. Nothing to say as it's a good name to have it on your resume.
good,"If you begin here as a Part time worker, it will be at least 10 years until you are offered a full time position inside the facility. Driving is a better option for full time work, but that turns into a job and a half, with the average work week of 70 hours. That being said, the benefits are the only thing that keeps part timers working there."
good,"Great place to work, however you may get 20 hours one week and 50 the next, so the pay is not consistent. Overnight shifts are difficult with a family, and daytime shifts come with seniority."
good,"They didn't understand what health conditions. They thought it's all just simple things that can be dealt with medications."
good,"Great place to work for if you don't want a life filled with family. Great pay and benefits. Long hours will be worked regardless of what day it is. Once your day is done if it's early you will be helping other people, which is a good thing as long as you remember you are part of a team. No sarcasm intended, I am a team player but besides the hours great place to work for."
good,Being on the group lever of UPS. one is still regarded as having capacity to operate an any role under the unionized jobs.  opportunities in unionized jobs are not restricted to internal candidates
good,"UPS is a great company that has been around for 100+ years. They offer great benefits (dental, vision, health). Monday - Friday work shift with Sunrise, Day, Twilight, and Night shifts offered. The expectations are high and they expect your best effort every day. You can get burned out fairly quickly, but don't take it personally. There are advancement opportunities available, but they are limited."
good,"I worked in vail co and it is a resort place. So we Had people send all thing form a envelope to a deer mounting, we were very busy during the winter and in the summer but dunning may and April we were slow."
good,"The relationship between different parts of management is mediocre at best. A lot of time and energy is wasted waiting on decisions to either be made, or corrected. The turn over rate prevents employees from becoming motivated/engaged, and adds unnecessary tension between new hires and veterans."
good,"If your not ready to work and lift at a fast pace this is not for you. The hours were good, The managers were okay, it's a hit or miss with certain managers though. The pay was decent, it could have been a little better in my opinion."
good,"Direct management was awesome, but the ability to advance is a VERY long process i.e. years.  The benefits are spectacular but due to the nature of job it can get highly repetitive very quickly.  All in all, I can't say it was a bad place to work for, the pay was good, benefits very good but I was hired on part-time and really the only way to move to full-time would have required me to move very far away and there was no real hope for a position opening up locally soon."
good,Good place to work at but low hours and not a  guaranteed 40 hours. Great supervisors and they have everything planned out and under control. They are big in safety and they always treat their workers!
good,Ive workerd at Ups for about 2 and a half years now. The first two years i was loading and unloading trucks. Currently I landed a postion that I clean the building which is a much slower pace job
good,"i work at UPS Sunday to Thirsday, 10:30pm to 2am. I learned how to do quick work to be hard worker. I was part time employed. actually, I love it because it was gym work."
good,"very labor intensive, loading boxes in to trucks/vans."
good,"The only thing i liked about UPS, was the Advancement Opportunities. I dont have a problem working with UPS, but the fact that i didn't have a trainer with me the 1st day like i was told, was not too good."
good,Fast-paced working environment. Never a dull moment. Stressful but fun. There are some days that are easy too. Management group that I worked with are very professional.
good,"I started as a preloader at UPS while in college, and am now a part-time Preload Supervisor. Very fast paced environment that was a good fit for me but not everyone."
good,"It's a very stressful/fast passed job. I start at 4 am so the hours and timing aren't my favorites. I have a daughter so I get up at 3 am, get ready, then head out the door to get there at 4:00 am. The benifits are great but almost not worth it with all the stress the job brings with it. They expect too much from one person in a little amount of time with three trucks being responsible for. The management gets mad at the employees for not being fast enough but everyone has a time of the night where it gets too overwhelming and they miss boxes. You have to load three trucks while boxes keep coming non stop so by the time you get out of one truck u missed boxes. In my opinion they are understaffed and expect to much of there workers but the management does work just as hard and helps make everything click..."
good,"I've only worked at UPS for 8 work days, but it was alright. I've delivered packages to doors, and my driver was friendly, but I would rather not work in the dead of winter again."
good,"a day @ UPS for me would cinsist of unloading as many trailers or package cars i could in a day, unloading boxes on to a conveyor belt. i learned some really useful safety steps and the proper way to lift a package. Management was great and the culture all around is indeed a comforting experience. One of the hardest things about the job would be when we had a time frame to finish trailers, and the most enjoyable part was the physical workout you get from the job."
good,"The United Parcel Service has great benefits and the environment is extremely quick paced and professional. Trains any employee that is willing to learn. Look to promote employees that exhibit, tough to find, hard work ethic."
good,"UPS will pay you well, but they will work you hard. There are plenty of opportunities to grow in the company, and they usually hire within the company."
good,"I would say that UPS is a good place to be as an everyday employee; once you get into management though, I would strictly use UPS as a place to gain experience in a management environment, then leave as soon as possible to a better paid, less physically demanding management job."
good,at ups I learned how to work with a team of people to accomplish one goal. My daily task consisted of sorting or unloading packages in a fast time span. Hardest part of the job was working on my feet for hors and non stopped working.
good,"I worked for the company for 30 years. Great company for pay and benefits awful company for family life. The average work day is 10 hours per day. The only perks the job has great people to work with, great people to deliver to you get to know a lot of people."
good,"If you are perusing a career and you go to school this is a great place to start. It is very important to seek promotion as soon as you start with this company, so you get the experience and when you graduate from college leave it."
good,Throughout the course of a shift UPS is for the most part a quite environment you do your job and people will not mess with you usually but some managers go over the top and forget that you are a adult not a child.
good,UPS has great benefits but if you aren't in school or have been there for several years then the job does nothing for you. Management started hiring supervisors with no training and they started to treat employees very unfairly.
good,It was okay but it was hard to balance the work schedule & personal life. I think that type of job is for older people or someone who has already settled in on life & knows that that's what they want to do.
good,"Load trailers."
good,Trucks are either cold or hot depending on the weather.  Learned how to properly unload and load a tractor trailer.  Management was not so good due to them willing to promote any individual that has worked there after 30 days.
good,A typical day a ups is allot of boxes but learn how to be quick paced and oraganized. Management can have there good and bad days but overall there ok and the workplace culture is very diverse you meet different people and personalities. The hardest part of the job to me is knowing we're every box goes and just making sure all the trucks leave on time. There is enjoyable day at ups except your 5 min break
good,"The job wasn't so bad, the main issue I have is management. We were not allowed to have our phones at all but the supervisors could. When we were busy the would text and talk on the phone and if you asked for help they would laugh and say welcome to UPS."
good,"I think I messed up, because I just did this and I can't move on without filling this out. So here's a bunch more characters until I can move on. asdf"
good,"When I left they had just moved to a new facility and it wasn't uncommon to see broken fans and heaters or less than pristine moving equipment, which gets to be a bit of a problem in the summer while moving big heavy boxes on a rusty cart with no brakes in a tin building in the middle of summer. The good news is they have plenty of vending machines with snacks and drinks, the bad news is you'll probably be reprimanded if you go to use them during your shift, so get there early or bring a bottle of water. And make sure you bring a nice insulated bottle if you decide to bring one at all, because during the winter season I've had the pleasure of seeing my water turned to slush during my shift. Normally your union rep can get big things, like broken heaters or fans, squared away in a few days though."
good,"great place to work, culture was great and people always smiles. Fund account are balance.  accounts not balance.  management was great.greag taking on new customer accounts"
good,"I used to be a package handler, but now I've been promoted as a sorter where I sort package in different chutes into the trailer. The most hardest part of the job is that I have to handle over hundreds of thousands of packages everyday by myself."
good,It's hard work but it's not complicated job and benefits are good  after 30 days of training is done the union can now back you up ujust in case you get mistreated by the management which is a good sign when you're working for a big company and your coworkers at the job is good people
good,Load and unload tractor trailers trucks.  Load and unload package trucks to UPS standards.  Made sure all safety and company policies were met.  Followed all company policies in regards to handling and loading Haz Mat..
good,coming in at 10:30 heading to my sorters station. getting ready for the trucks to unload packages from the truck and for me and maybe one other person to sorter out a whole trailer. I learned the different state codes where to send the package to the best of my memory. lift up boxes to 30-65 pounds and to assist in lifting 70 pounds and up wit help from another co worker. The work environment was straight metal and whatever season it was it decided the temperature in the building. The Hardest part about this job is keeping your work pace and energy 5 days of the week and every week. The most enjoyable part about working there was the different jobs sometimes they was show you how to do when u low on staff.
good,"I will never forget my time with UPS. I went there just expecting to work just like any other place but I ended up making so many friends. Every single person I worked with in my area I was friends with. The work was hard, but the day wasn't too long. The supervisor I worked under was great and made my time there enjoyable. If there was more of an equal opportunity there I may have stayed. On a typical day we were expected to unload around 1,200 boxes per hour onto a conveyor belt from inside of a tractor trailer. Other than that my experience there was unforgettable and I enjoyed the people who work there."
good,This job is hard work but very straight foward.  The environment is factory/warehouse one should not expect office professionalism here.
good,I worked as a driver helper and I like the physical part. I was able to get in shape while delivering. Got called for a permanent position. Typical day was meeting up with your driver and helping deliver.
good,a typical day at work would be unloading the trucks basically onto the converter belt. It was a pretty nice work environment overall and the management was pretty sharp.
good,I don't have a lot to say about this company other than telling you I've been here 9 years and the best thing in this company is opportunity to learn and grow. The worst is perception one person influences the hive.
good,"Good job but to much work in any weather situation, must the building you get go up and down carrier a lot box, parking is not easy, the salary is not good any more."
good,"A typical day at the job is filled with lot of yelling and orders given with management focused on getting the work out on time. The job is not too hard, just pacing and working safe."
good,Working with the UPS driver. I learned that every time you drop off a package on the front yard you must always hide it from anyone's view. The workplace was the truck was so crowded and full of just packages. The hardest part of my job was struggling where to leave the package if the house the package was going to didn't have pillars nor any front bushes or anything so looking for a place to hide the package especially when it was a bigger package and more. The most enjoyable part of my job was the driver I was helping out.
good,You go to work everyday see the same people do the same repetitive thing. Work your way up job if you end up staying for 3 years for a shot at being a driver thats what you want to do.
good,"A typical workday consists of loading, unloading and/or sorting packages of different weight, shapes and sizes. I've learned to use safe work methods, utilizing my power zone to lift and lower packages. Management are adamant about productivity. The hardest part of the job is lifting bulk objects which are packages that weight 70+ lbs."
good,"Union job. Absolutely free healthcare. Wages less than other LTL carriers, but that is offset by the abundance of benefits."
good,"Working for UPS was okay because the hours worked with my schedule but the work environment was extremely stressful. During peak season, we would walk into the shift having to clean up the mess from the previous shift which made our work load harder and more frustrating."
good,Fast paced environment with little time to relax. Very hectic during the  holiday season. The management was very friendly and brought us snacks and food to keep us going.
good,"The job is easy if you don't put your back into it. Use your brain.  If you are in school, UPS will reimburse your tuition if you pass your classes."
good,"UPS is a fast moving company, could be a long term job, benefits are great. This job doesn't get a break, work non stop for 5+ hours. Get paid weekly."
good,"you will work at the least 5 hours a day. overtime is easy to get. easy  and quick to get on the job come peak season. "
good,Its a good place to work as a package handler if your looking for part time work. They leadership is extremely competent and act very mature if something goes wrong. They believe in working as a team and never leaves a man behind.
good,The msnagement is interested in achieving their pph (package per hour) more than dealing with the people needs.the shifts ate changing daily someyimes they give 7 hours shifts and sometimes they send us home after 3 hours. You can not build a family on a changing schedule like that
good,Alright work place however to much negativity by some workers. They tried to hard to keep workers by promising a good bonuses however had taxes take it out
good,"I drove flat bed for UPS out of Fulton MS, dedicated Furgeson Plumbing account. Started off being regional, home every week. Gradually started keeping me out longer and longer. So I never really sat at all. Only had straps on trailers, no chains or anything. Pay was pretty good, just no respect for home time."
good,I learned how to play Tetris a lot better. My co workers were very helpful when needed. The manager was very interactive with his employees also.
good,"The job was a perfect blend of a work environment filled with physical labour and mental planning and organizing. A strong emphasis was placed on teamwork, and results. Working under tight timelines made the job both enjoyable and stressful at times."
good,"je veux travailler encore te encore très motives "
good,U.P.S. Is a great job to start your work career off with. This job has room for you to grow within the business. It gave me a chance to show that I can hang with the the tough league.
good,"Work very short shifts and just to load boxes into different trucks. I learned how to do sort and load boxes into trailers. Management is cool each belt has its own supervisor. Co-workers are nice, cool minded people.The hardest part is dealing with the conditions in the workplace the building is very dirty and the fans blow more dirt in the trailer."
good,"UPS is a great place to work. the benefits are great, the management is okay, and the starting pay and hours are terrible."
good,"A preloader responsibilities are to load the delivery truck according to the map for the driver"
good,"It is a good place to work, always someone new to meet. You will be around people from all walks of life. Demanding schedule day and night"
good,This was a great job for me when I was in High School but Part Time employment was not enough post-graduation. It was a very physical job but training helped out a lot.
good,They praise safety but only when it doesn't interfere with production. The location must meet their numbers and it doesn't matter if that means chucking a box 10 feet to improve efficiencies.
good,A typical day at work includes scanning and loading trucks at a fast paste in the most efficient way possible.
good,"only drivers and their supervisors are full time. 2/3 work force are part time only, I've been part time 28 years. excellent benefits for all employees. fast pace work with time restraints"
good,Everyday full truck when shift starts at days end few parcels remain due to being unable get to every stop being expected to empty the truck of deliveries is a hassle there were times were that was possible .
good,The toughest part of this job is dealing with rude customers and the fact that the job can be very fast paced and demanding at certain times. It is the perfect 1st job to have though as you will learn a lot of basic skills and how to provide adequate customer service.
good,Great company and organization.  Learned a lot about myself with this company and enhanced my skills.  Too much management and switching our pay scale on bonus too much.
good,It is difficult to get promoted or go from part-time to full-time. There is great diversity in the work environment. The benefits are good for a part-time job. They do work with you to balance your personal life.
good,"Lifting 600 or more boxes per day. "
good,"a typical is fun especially if you like working fast pace jumping out of cars and things it keeps you busy most of the day."
good,"if looking for a good starting job UPS would be suitable due to their health benefits, however if you get sick easily I wouldn't recommend, due to the lack of cleanlimess"
good,"Typically its not that bad, pretty physical job, the people are cool to talk to usually and the environment sucks. Needs better management I feel like half of the supervisors don't even really know what their doing."
good,"The best part about working at UPS is that my co-workers are all really cool people. Definitely the best part about working there. Everything else isn't as fun. Condensing 6 hours worth of work into 3-4 hours, management tends to disapear. If you can count to 5 you can do any job at UPS"
good,"The most hardest duty about the is bending over lifting the packages, and coming up from lifting the boxes. It really does put work on your back and strains muscles."
good,"Depending on what we had going on or who called in, I would go from unloading 48' - 53' throughout the night. But my regular job would be loading up 6 trucks that deliver packages to homes. They would range up to 500 packages per truck. If not needed there, I would go to the sorting line and sort the packages by zip code at the mykawa warehouse. Worked well with others, if they needed help I wouldn't hesitate to help if needed."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people, and seeing different parts of town. The hardest part about the job was that I never got to work a full week due to the other helpers who needed to work as well."
good,"UPS offered great benefits like discounts, insurance, etc. The hours were limited but the hourly pay was good. The work was very hard. Work environment was difficult."
good,Consistent workflow in the warehouse and working with great and hardworking people with great benefits. Pay rate is real low and working extremely physically hard.
good,"This job is not terrible, but the hours are pretty insane. Some days are horrible because they are not organized very well."
good,Hard active job. Fast paste. Short hours. Weekly pay. Great benefits. Yearly raises. Able to earn extra cash during peak season.
good,"Great place to work and fairly flexible on hours. Compensation appears to be below comparable positions in other industries. Non-operations appears to be more lenient on the work-life balance versus operations (delivery, sorting, etc.)."
good,"It is very fast paced and physically demanding which I adore. There is a high standard of safety, retention, production and accuracy that must be met and maintained."
good,"The work is very physically demanding on top of a lack of sleep, because you start work late night or early, early morning depending on the shift you chosen for part-time.  Depending on what UPS center or city, it may take 5 years or more to advance to full-time.  Many people don't have the patience to stick it though.  If you decide to go into management, depending on the center or city in which you work; you probably won't get promoted to full-time management unless you have Bachelor's Degree.  If you do decide to go into management whether full-time or part-time, be prepared to take 'flack' from the supervisors above you."
good,"I walk into the hub, clock-in and head straight to work. Once I'm done with the day, clock-out and head home. I learned to try and help the people I work with more because for all I know, they could be having to deal with real world problems like myself. Not all management was bad. There are some that take more advantage of others than the rest. Just be sure to write your hours down. Co-workers were the only people I could really talk to about anything. In fact, I learned more from co-workers than I did management. Hardest part of the job is the manual labor. There are quite a few packages that aren't you're average small box. Just be sure you can lift 70 lbs without having to use extreme force. Now the most enjoyable part of the job is, for me, the labor. Crazy, right? I like being physically active. It keeps me from being lazy. For others though, it's leaving for home."
good,Very demanding job and labor-intensive also harsh work conditions. Management was fairly ok due to the fact the part-time supervisors are all younger than 35yrs.
good,"Working for UPS was a good experience. My co-workers where a good bunch of people that where fun and energetic. Management was ok. What I have learned at ups is the gws system as well as shipping & receiving and pick medical supplies. I also learned how to drive most of the forklifts. for example stand up, sit down, and cherry picker."
good,Atender as necessidades do dia a dia e gerar novas idéias para a equipe é essencial para se alcançar novas áreas.
good,you can make very good living and your co workers are very talented and motivated but you have to deal with an high stress environment at times
good,Its not for me I dont like the work environment. The union and management dont get along if they did and held people accountable to their actions it would run better.
good,"very high pace work environment that you have to get used to, great coworkers will help if you need it ,great management they will try there hardest to get you to be comfortable"
good,Very fast paced work environment. Great benefits both medical and 401 k investment plans. Decent base pay but not enough hours.
good,It is really not a bad job to some extend. Some days you have long hours other you have short hours which affect your pay check.
good,"UPS was an alright job with good benifits and oppertunity to grow within the company. Though it was understaffed and the business coming through each day was incredibly more than the facility could and should handle, even for its over 6000 employees."
good,Hard And good place to work  Busy have to work safe .   Can you get injured if you're not  paying  attention what is around you .   Use proper lifting techniques .
good,"Long late nights"
good,"A typical day for me would start at 4:30am.  I would come in early and start my pc and then get ready for the day.  I would check my email or any notices or issues that were already occuring.  This was only an in-bound call center.   We were always busy, which I always liked."
good,"Mon-Fr Package handling 3 and a half to five hours"
good,"UPS provided tuition reimbursement, health insurance, 401K, and job security, and yearly raises. The cons to working at UPS depends on what type of job you have. Management have to deal with unions. Non-management have very laborious jobs and advancement takes years. UPS is very nepotistic.. upper management favor their families and friends that work in the company"
good,"Middle management (front-line, part time supervisor) was the worst position in the company. No matter what, you never could have a good day. Upper management and the union employees wouldn't allow for it. My advice would be to stay in the union unless you have a degree to try and go full time."
good,Fast paced job place. Negative and rude Managers. Employees are fun and friendly. I learned how to keep up it was hard at first but after the third month I exceled.
good,UPS provides one of the most comprehensive and advanced sales training in the industry. The management team always supports its employees and provides the necessary skills to exceed sales goals.
good,The job i very difficult. Its very fast pace loud and the weather plays a big factor. The management can be better by interacting with the employees and figuring out their problems.
good,"It's a trying job. The way you are treated depends on your work performance. If you are exceeding expectations, they treat like royalty. If you are struggling, instead of helping, they treat you like a liability."
good,okay work place but your co-workers make it fun. Job can be difficult at times due to staffing at times of the year. Weekly pay is a bonus.
good,A group must work together to reach a common goal. Must also work hard and fast while also maintaining safe work methods.
good,"Working at UPS was very rewarding personally and professionally "
good,"- Bearbeitung von Kundenanfragen bezüglich Rechnungsstellung"
good,A typical day at work included dealing with hazardous material spills and running my own area of about 10-12 employees at a time. I learned the value of working towards a goal in production. The hardest part of the job was the amount of volume that would be coming down the line at one time.
good,"I worked at UPS for two years, the work is heavy demanding, management needs a little work, benefits and pay are great. The people you meet there are unique characters and make the work worth while."
good,Ups is a seniority based company.Meaning there are employees that have been there alot longer and they get the majority of the work.Other than the lack of continuous work Ups is a decent job.
good,"Benifits are great."
good,Too much work not enough pay. It would be nice if employee's could work the day shift and get 100% of their tuition paid for. Working nights is a trap. Most employee's end up quitting school because they're too tired to go to class during the day. So their life becomes just working at UPS.
good,A typical day at work was delievering and picking up parcels to be sent off I learned how parcels are sorted and learned how to keep on time with targets i.e delievering parcels eary/on time
good,Great place to make some money. All work and no play tho. Management stays late and not much home life balance. Great co-works and great business overall.
good,They need to lighten up. Still in the 1900's via their dress code and policies.  Their benefits are great.  Management is fine.  They promote within but sometimes promote employees who have no experience in the particular position they applied for.
good,"-work/life balance- is not taken into account"
good,the job is fine if you like supervisors that cannot communicate well with each other. its really dim and hard to work in. also you are under payed.
good,"I don't have very many good things to say about UPS. Its definitely not would you would expect out of a Fortune 500 company thats for sure. Don't get me wrong it has the union and union benefits but the management has a close eye kept on them and they still take the risk of getting complaints written up against them for getting out of line with the worker. Now when I worked there it felt like management against the union except for one supervisor that was just a nice guy in general. You are also worked to the point of exhaustion in a cold/hot truck, depends on the weather my warehouse didn't have AC or Heating. They say you don't have to lift over 70 lbs. That is a blatant lie, I remember most days out of the week i was lifting tems over 100 lbs. So you tell me is it worth the Union and the benefits."
good,"Always kept busy and had something to work on. Helping the operations with meeting goals and fixing issues. Have met the best coworkers and enjoyed working side by side with them.  Hours have been tough and only opportunity to change jobs wasn't posted, more of career development."
good,"Arbeitstag sehr unterschiedlich,"
good,I like the job very well the managers stay on you about safety other than that the job was great. I worked on unloading truck was kinda fun but a challenge at the same time. I like that type of work.
good,Working for UPS Freight was an interesting experience. Forklift operation is pretty fun but the dock at the location was horrible. Management was BAD as well.
good,"The position was overnight, it was quiet but very busy. The position was in a very climate contoled enviorment. They brought in lunch for all of the employees."
good,"A typical day at work was really slow, everyone was so involved in they're own position that they didn't want to train the helpers to help them out. I learned that I had to take the iniative on my own and take  a lot of notes. Some of the managers were short and some were really nice and patience. The people that I worked with were nice the drivers were nice, and the other Coordinator Helpers were nice and helpful to me. Finding work to make the day go by faster. Learning about how a Fortune 500 company is being ran by packages and how serious they take their job, especially around the Christmas Holiday."
good,"a typical day at work would be like, sign in, go to boss and get assigned a bay. once assigned a bay I get working,  handling the packages entering the trailer bay.  and this doesn't stop for until the trailer is entirely full and then I move on to the next trailer."
good,"Is A Nice place to work and the pay is good but there to many racist people and it effect my job cause i don't like racist people."
good,I would sort boxes on a conveyor belt and load them onto the package cars. I learned how a global company manages shipping and human resources. The hardest part of the job was the strain on the body and waking up at 3:00 A.M. for work.
good,I notice people worked fast. seems to be constant work til trucks are filled
good,"On a typical day, I would go into the call center, log into the computer and begin responding to requests. I would respond to requests through phone calls. I learned how the shipping process worked and how to be a supervisor. My coworkers were fun, hardworking people. The hardest part of the job was getting all the requests completed by the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get the packages to the customers."
good,Constantly moving from beginning to end of your shift with 10 minute breaks for the 4 to 5 hours you work per shift.
good,"a lot of driving site to site"
good,its ok. i had the best coworkers. hardest part was the heavier packages
good,They make you feel as if your the burden in which they have to take care of.  they want you to be a robot and only perform at the pace they want you to.  Don't expect full time the waitng list is around 10years to become full time
good,"Good place to start a career an gain experience, good al pal mentality so opportunities are there but difficult to get them"
good,"I worked night shirt for school tuition compensation. The work was short but  you never knew when you would be dismissed. it could be quite physical at times, especially during peak holiday season."
good,"No matter if you work in the package sorting, loading, unloading, or jet loading this is a job you have to work full go from the moment you clock in to get the work done and shipped on time. Everything has to be correctly sorted and ready to ship on time everyday. I gained a greater attention to detail handling and sorting thousands of packages. Management was very strict about knowing rules and safety guidelines because of constant audit checks. Most enjoyable part of this job is being out on the tarmac with the jets."
good,This job is extremely beneficial in the long run. I was in the warehouse and had to load ad unload the trucks in a timely and organized fashion. The bad part was that I would only get to work maybe 4 hours a week because I was not in the union. I had to quit because it took a month of actual days worked to be part of the union and I had just gotten my own place and could not afford 4 hours a week.
good,"stressed environment, high volume traffic. Daily goals that are met as far as operational and financial targets."
good,"I work the late night shift and it was during the winter, A typical night working at UPS was cold, but the faster you move the less cold you became. With this being my first job, I was new to the skills, people and environment. There would be slow days and then there would be fast days. The slow days we barely received any packages. The fast days we had all the packages and had to beat the clock. If one of us were left behind my coworkers and I would help each other out. The hardest part of the job though was beating the clock, because he we had to have all the packages sorted and packed in the truck before a certain time."
good,"Fast paced environment where exceeding quota is a priority.  Devise staffing plan for most productive results, review production every fifteen minutes with employees to motivate.  I learned how to communicate with various types of personalities, always finding the positive in situations and constant positive reinforcement all play a major role in production goals."
good,Unload and loaded trucks the time i was there.. Have great benefits for full time and part time employees..
good,Big company with not much opportunity.  Working in an union environment also really sucks.
good,a typical day at work was fast paced. what I learned was to have speed when it comes to fast paced work environment. my management and co-workers did not have a problem at all. the hardest part of the job was travel to and from work environment and the enjoyable part of the job was three to four hours of work
good,"A typical day at my job involves the forwarding of packages from the front end of the building to the load-side of the building. My specific responsibility is sorting packages according to their zip codes to ensure they reach the correct destination. I work with 15-20 employees, depending on the work season. The hardest part of the job is the physical demands. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with my fellow coworkers."
good,"Days would change depending on the season and weather. Typical days are 12 hour days.  Process improvement is a key to success and part of everyday learning. Management was very focused, driven and moving. Co-workers were also very focused dedicated individuals. The hardest part of the job is the never slow down pace especially during the 4th quarter. The most enjoyable is the learnings, skills and network developed"
good,"i loved working at ups until management was changed. new managers are not nice or reward employees for their hard work and safety. Also new managers would refuse break time, have workers come in hours early and ignore safety rules to make sure packages were delivered on time. it is a very physical, dirty job but is a good job if you are under good management."
good,It was a fun seasonal position. Sometimes you could work for 12 hrs.
good,"To be honest I like working at UPS but sometimes I just wish for more hours. I find the management there to be pretty tight and the co-worker , well, friendly. One time A co-worker kept putting me down saying that I'm slow or I shouldn't be working there because it isn't my thing. I kind of agree with him. I believe logistics isn't my thing but when it comes to doing it, I can do it."
good,"The work at UPS is not easy. You can easily get yourself hurt if you are not careful. Overall, UPS has the best medical insurance coverage. Some of the management decisions are suspect, but the company is able to make huge profits yearly. I love the hourly workers who are employed at UPS. Most are very hard working."
good,"Great benefits, if you stay there long enough. Good pay. Lots of room for over time pay during peak season. Shifts aren't long. Only down side is some of the packages are too heavy, and you look like you were beaten from all the bruises from boxes."
good,"Completing the electronic package data correction process "
good,"This was just a seasonal job working with one driver. I had a great time working with my co-worker, however communication with management was an issue. Only one of my five paychecks were sent to the right facility and it was not clear who my supervisor was."
good,"A typical day at work started fifteen minutes before start time, or as my boss liked to call it: Lombardi Time. It was a fast paced environment, I enjoyed the up's (No pun intended) and worked through the downs. I learned a lot about myself when I worked this job, especially the fact that I seem to work well under pressure."
good,"I was hired during peak season 2013 which was statistically the worst in UPS history. I had a lot to do but that was expected. I learned how to work fast and think fast and also learned how to smooth out distractions on the job. Management made a lot of accommodations for me at least and never had a problem with any of them. The older co-workers were very supportive and came to work without an attitude. The hardest part of the jobs was to keep up with the work load during peak season and not let work take away from my academic experience. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I had the same shift all the time, no surprises."
good,"UPS was a pretty good place to work, The people were were nice and the job came with nice benefits after a year. But after awhile the management became a little bad. People didn't know when to come to work so that was messing up other peoples hours because they would have to stay over to complete other people assignments. The hour were flexible and I learned how UPS gets packages delivered and accounted for."
good,"When they say its a physically intense environment, they mean it. Great benefits after a year. Holiday seasons = Higher workload."
good,"Working at UPS was difficult at times because on top of the strenuous workload, there was an uncomfortably immense amount of vulgar language used by all parts of the staff."
good,"UPS is a great place to make money as a driver. As a part time employee who has worked in a warehouse for the last 8 years, I have learned that with the changing benefits of the US with the Affordable Care Act, I will not be working here much longer. "
good,fast paced and a fun place to work at. Working with all my friends made it even better to work there
good,I was not able to move out of state at the time so I was forced to resign.
good,"just trained for the position haven't started yet. it starts in November 15, 2013"
good,Fast paced and productive. Learned the proper way to lift and carry. Hardest part of job was the sore feeling afterwards. Best part was weekly pay and free lunches sometimes. They treated their employees well mostly.
good,This job is difficult and stressful. If you are willing to deal with stress this job offers adequate compensation for your work.
good,"The hours varied daily. The work was fast paced. There were many departments, and you had to be familiar or learned to work in all of the departments. You had to learn how to adjust quickly. The co-workers were willing to help train. the hardest part was moving constantly and the most enjoyable part was when you caught on to what was being taught."
good,"The work in it self can be cumbersome as their are too many processes to learn in a year. "
good,crazy hours pay suck management was ok the hardest part was coming back to work every night
good,it was an easy work place but I didn't like the hours for the pay I was getting.
good,The hardest part of the job was making sure each step was done correctly and timely. There were so many steps to everything that needed to be done so it was difficult to keep everything on track.
good,"if u need a part-time job ups can help u. whether u trying to work afternoon, evenings, or midnight ups got the shift for u."
good,"A typical day involves starting with ensuring a good start to production, getting trailers done as soon as possible get work to primary.  Typically adjust what volume is unloaded to make sure the loaders can keep up and others remain busy in other areas. About half way through, I'll have to focus on air operations to make times for air plane to leave. During a typical day, there's usually some type of training required and observations must be done.  After everything is done, checking package cars and trailers.  Once the sort is completed, we finish up paper work and leave a voice mail for district and center manager. I've learned many different tasks and responsibility over the years. I am one of two hazardous materials auditors in the center and responsible for packages having correct labels. This job has given me experience with managing up to 15 employees, and how to handle difficult situations including discipline. The hardest part of the job is a lack of communication between customers and management.  Getting the wrong volume estimates can make the job much more difficult to make trailer pulls. The best part is the people I work with and every day has different challenges."
good,This job is excellent for someone who is interested in working their way up the latter over a long period of time and who does not care about the financial barracades that come along.
good,My typical day was spent managing the Sort Aisle and trainging my employees. 
good,I learned alot about udated technologh through the UPS Store training and constant updated copiers.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that I was not given a Asst. Manager to help take on the everyday tasks that needed to be done to make the business run smoothly.  I loved hiring and training my employees from day one and helping them to find their next phase in life. 
good,clock in load trailors it was ok they would feed us a little hot but over all it was ok.
good,"Its a great place to work if you are just going to school and need some money on side as it pays for your school. Can't see much reason to stay there, the pay is low and no chances to get full time unless your there 10+ years."
good,"Typical Workday includes Set up of Area with verification of correct Feeder Number and Destination.  Communication with Lead Supervisor on any Staffing issues and current Saftey, Service, and Production numbers on previous day. Have Learned and Improved on my Communication skills with hub employees. Relationships with the union including shop stewards and Union Reps. The Hardest and also most enjoyable part of my job is the Supervision of Problem employees and working on thei personal effort to get the job done right"
good,My last days at UPS I was in charge of the training department of new employees. I was also entrusted as a floating supervisor covering areas inside hub including their premium services which is next day air packages. Duties also included inbounding and out bounding also payroll 
good,Customer Service Representative
good,"The work was steady, I learned a lot of clericla experience, and the atmosphere was great."
good,"A typical day at UPS, I will show up and go through at least 4-6 trailers depending on volume. Most likely I will get off around 9-10:30 pm."
good,"It's a decent place to work. Nothing to be ""wow-ed"" about. Working here is somewhat easy. Basically just meet your quota and everything will be okay."
good,"I log onto my computer and also different computer programs, I then proceed to retrieve pros (bills) from one of the programs, I then pull pricing group numbers to find who is the responsible party for paying and also if they have established pricing with UPS. After obtaining all the correct pricing information, I then apply this pricing to the pro."
good,start my day off by setting up equiptment for staff.
good,"Safety first work place, There's great teamwork, The greatest part about working at UPS was the benefits,"
good,"Stocks shelves, counters, racks, and tables with merchandise."
good,work is very active take a lot of muscle to lift boxes learn how to work together to be more productive management is somewhat helpful coworkers are fairly ok the hardest part of the job is to stay active it sometimes get boring the most enjoyable part is working
good,It is very back breaking work and you do have to put your time in order to advance with the company.
good,Very safe work environment.
good,"A typical day consists of of approximately three and a half to four hours of package sorting a weeknight. As a package travels down the conveyor line workers are expected to properly handle and sort the package, based on zip code, to one of several other color coded conveyor belfts. I've learned safe lifting methods and how to stay relatively calm under stressfull work conditions. Fellow co workers, as well as management, are pleasant overall. The hardest part of the job is being able to work at a fast pace consistently in leu of what seems to be a never ending flow of packages."
good,"A typically day for me starts at 430pm. As soon as I walk in for the first two hours until break I am put into one of the heaviest trailers in my outbound. This trailer flows 1,000 packages an hour. This is a very difficult thing to do. For one before I load any package i must check the SLICS area code to make sure it is being sent to the right destination. After our 10 minuet break, I am moved to the bulk line. The bulk line is where all the packages that are either to large or to heavy to be sent down rollers that go into a trailer. I do this until I get off around 10;30 pm."
good,"UPS is a business partner that can easily be a part of any supply chain to help control costs and grow revenues. They do not hesitate to spend monies to make their technology ""world class"" to any size business. My co-workers were friendly & helpful. It's an adjustment to get used to their micromanagement of the sales teams."
good,"If your looking for a job where you work part time and can get paid for school this is the job for you. You also get great benefits: Medical, dental you don't pay for. 401K that they match up to 3% I believe. You only work M-F, but that's where it gets stressful-at least during the Holidays!"
good,they have a program which pays for school which is a plus but u start out at the bottom sorting boxes and the pay is very lousy. another good thing is the discounts you get when working at ups
good,my day starts at 6:00am when i get to work the first thing that i do is santize my work area. im on the phone for eight hours. the next thing i do is log on to my computer and i began inbounding/ outbounding drivers as they come in and out of the work terminal.i also learned a new skill working with yard control. i direct the shifters at work to put up certain trailers for different doors and i also keep up with the loaded trailers on the yard so they will go out on time. My mangement team is ok. most are kind of reserve and stand offish but if u have a problem u can come to them. what i have learned about some of co-workers is some them have no sense of promptness and they are slacking when it comes to doing their jobs. they do just enough to get by and i dont like that. the hardest part of my job was to sit there and do my job to the best of my ability and see other coworkers slacking from doing their jobs. the most enjoyable part of the job when we have health fairs and cookouts.
good,•Performed manual labor loading and unloading trailers.
good,"A typical day as a supervisor includes area setup, determining proper staffing, efficiently completing all operations and safety paper work, effectively placing and moving employees to necessary working areas in order to maximize production, ensuring a safe work environment, completing payroll and managing any disciplinary action necessary. The hardest part about the job is motivating my peers to work at their full potential, however the most enjoyable part is the challenge this presents with the constant and daily changes."
good,Work is often busy which is great. I learned to perfect multitasking. The management is super helpful as well as the coworkers. There really isnt a hard part in the job in my opinion. I adapt quickly to my surroundings and I am a very quick learner. I love working with all types of people. The interaction with new people is fun and you learn alot from others.
good,"UPS is a good place to work, given that you are at a location with managemnt personnell who car about their employees. The benefits are excellent. The hub environment is for the younger workforce who are just getting into the job market. Great for beginning management."
good,"Straight forward 4 to 5 hour shift. Part time nothing to get rich off of. Dedicate you time and effort and it will pay off in the long run; full coverage benefits health, dental, and vision. Its also a manly job would recommend for women. Co-workers are ok, but like to talk hard, and the most important thing I learned is, don't go in there thinking your superman take your time with your work or you'll get burned out quick."
good,I've worked there for six years and I've had four positions and now I'm management. There is defiantly room for growth they pay for school so you can better yourself. There are always openings for management and they help you get the promotion.
good,"Working for UPS was also a great experience in the shipping/receiving field. I learned how to do inventory, load trucks and ship out packages. The hardest part of the job was just the training but the duties were pretty much easy once I got used to it. The coworkers were very hardworking and provided team work. Management was pretty pleasant."
good,Good company with a nice benefits package and decent pay. advancement opportunities are there but limited
good,- Great benefits
good,Worked 10 -12 hour days for most of my career. Great pay and benefits and room for advancement.
good,The UPS Store was a good place to work and learn a small part of the shipping market. The inside look into packaging and shipping companies is a real eye opener
good,"They start you at part time which makes sense because it is physical work. Loading/unloading trailers of boxes, packages, bags, lifting/pushing up to 70lbs and more for up to 5 hours. It’s a workout, but not something I’d do permanently."
good,Felt like I wasn't given the adequate training that I needed to be the best I could at my job. However the benefits and pay did make up for that. I wouldn't mind working there again
good,"Mosy new employes will start as loaders. You are expected to load at least three package cars. The holiday season is brutal but, worth the time. During this time your hours will be doubled to handle the increasing volume."
good,"The job is difficult at first but it get easier, management is okay but they could be better and whatever you do please do not hurt yourself trying to get all the parcels to their destination. safety first."
good,"A hard place to work lots of physical labor and long hours."
good,"It was okay need longer breaks so we can be fully energized. Was really hot the fans, didn't really help and some managers have messed up attitudes. Some managers will even get u in trouble for no reason."
good,"we start working at around 4:30, we would wait about 10 minutes until packages started to get all the way towards the front of the belt. Very hard work."
good,This company has very good benefits and salary but the work is very demanding and work life balance can be difficult.  You will have opportunities for advancement if that is what you are looking for.
good,"It is not a bad place to work but the hours are lacking, it is good that they hire from within but when it is not close to holiday season the hours are lacking."
good,"You have to stand for yourself,then you're an out cast for a while."
good,"The work is easy. Yes, the supervisor will tell you to move faster, but as long as you're trying, what can they do? Being on the Preload shift, the hardest part is arriving on time (usually 4am). After a 12 (or 9?) months of this, you  begin to see the enviable benefits part-time UPS employees are known for: health insurance, 401k, tuition reimbursement, and paid vacations. Not a fun or friendly bunch, but a good way to start your day and supplement your income."
good,"Overall it is a very convenient job for students as the preload shift usually starts at 2-3am and ends around 830 am leaving you with the rest of the day for your classes."
good,The job was nice I really like it but it was too much for less money. Also the managers was cool and I enjoy working there but like I said the work was Little bit too much.
good,"Pros: the different shifts this company offered. At the facility I previously worked the managers were amazing. Very wonderful at motivating the employees. This is what I will miss."
good,"The benefits are great for full-time employment, however, the days are 10-12 hours for drivers, Monday to Saturdays. A typical day at work picking up the truck and going to delivery 400 to 600 packages."
good,I learned you working at ups you can actually move at your own paste and still get your assigned task done before end of Shift by staying focus and letting all distractions stay out the way
good,For anyone who is part time it is very hard to find anywhere else who will pay the same and the hours. Biggest downfall is advancement and the environment.
good,Nice people to work with who certainly make you feel like part of the team. Work however was tiring and long and extremely repetitious making it very boring and not really work the pay.
good,"The work Environment as a Loader/Sorter, is a Fast paced Job during peak season, and is great for college kid who are looking to make some money, but you had better be willing to put in the work. "
good,Well I didn’t like the hours they was giving me I also feel like the pay period works kinda weird because ever time I use a calculator to average my check out it wouldn’t be what I thought it was going to be but some people are nice there and like you for who you are
good,"Mass production. Stress level is 10/10, they want those boxes in that ups truck fast & in order. If you don’t really care rather or not you lose your job, ups is for you. If you do care, the stress level will drive you crazy every single day @3:00am in the morning."
good,"Good work rewards you and gets you noticed very quickly. Good benefits. Wonderful workplace and co workers. Management lacks in certain areas, however it is nothing that would be detrimental to the environment"
good,"Sort Packages according to zip codes and states"
good,"UPS offers one of the most generous tuition reimbursement programs in the marketplace, helping college students finance their education and attend school while working part-time or full-time at UPS."
good,"It is a very active job. Very fast paced! When I was there the pay was not good to me but I’ve heard it had gradually increased. I don't know how true it is though. It can be stressful at times, especially during the holidays. One break , no lunch. You can wear regular clothing but you have to wear steel toe shoes. You have to dress accordingly to the weather because it can get too hot or too cold."
good,"I was only a 16 year old in high school only good job I can get at the time, I work here & I was a unloader but now im 20 I want to be a driver I turn 21 in June & I have experience"
good,"UPS was a good part time job for me, it taught me a lot of things such as time management skills, being able to work in a fast paced environment, and being able to collaborative with my peers. With me being a student, the hours worked well with me at three hours five days a week. This gave me time to put school first and to make money for myself at the side. Eventually I had to leave due to school being stressful and I couldn't do both things at the same time."
good,I left because of cutting hours and miss communication but otherwise it was a great job. Good work with hands-on and using procedure body requirements.
good,"Although I wasn't there long enough, for a part time job, it was great. This being my second job, end time became an issue. I accepted employment with a set schedule that didn't exist."
good,there at ups it was fun at first but the starting pay was not good and working in conditions that can do harm you have to be careful and follow procedures to work safely but working there after all was a learning experience. the pay for how mush work your do does not mach and it takes years to get pay increase if your working in the facility.for drivers its different their pay is much more then some one how works in the base .management was good not bad you must work five days a week and the benefits are really good great
good,"Overall it's a good part-time job if you're in school but do not depend on this place if you live on your own and need a stable job and income."
good,Put a lot of years into this company for them not to allow me to grow and move forward . How ever was able to establish and abundant amount of experience being with a union like UPS.
good,"The hours are horrible at best you'll get 21 to 25 hours at best unless they are allowing double shifting "
good,Just the working conditions are really bad for me especially since it is very HOT and there really isnt any cool air circulation so.. your basically in an oven's for 5 hours straight no breaks because of course I was a part time employee
good,"decent pay"
good,They are a great company to work for very friendly and good people they are very dedicated workers give everyone a chance equally accept others for who they are
good,It was alright at first but the people there seem to have some high expectations of their workers to be able to perform at certain thresh holds but it is the person who works there that knows their own physical and mental thresh hold
good,Good company just not for me.  Not sure what else to say to get to 150 characters.  Being verbose is not my strong suit.  Uhm well...  UPS Go Brown!!!!
good,Management would treat employees as if we was lesser people and chose rather to yell at us than speak. I did appreciate the job from learning how to organize packages within a certain time limit and although shifts were long it wasn't as bad as others would say.
good,UPS isn’t the best nor the worst company to work for. Some have good experiences some employees don’t.
good,Overall its a cool place to work at it has its pros and cons. I would work with the company again if I wanted to. The job is very productive and time flies when working.
good,"So when I Started working at UPS it was tough but after my first couple of weeks, I started to enjoy the job. The supervisors at UPS work hard to make sure their dock is productive without being harsh to their package handlers. When I started the also told me to think of the job as paid work out session. Also, lift with your legs."
good,"Had no adequate training (as far as in-office). I had witnessed one 15 minute brakes, non-present managers, and low pay! The start time wasn’t a big problem because of advantages/disadvantages depending on your lifestyle."
good,Ups was good place to work just too bad it was temporary. All equipment needed for a job well done was provided by the company. Seasonal driving position is real good for extra money during the holidays.
good,"It's hot and sweaty. A lot of people who work there are in a bad mood. There was a lot of heavy lifting and people would join and leave the job every week. The managers were great though, and I made a lot of friends. Everyone is joined by their mutual respect for one another."
good,"The job wasn't bad at all, very up to speed work. Supervisor were very coachable and accommodating. The work enviroment was pretty chill and fun for the most part."
good,Great part time job to have while you are in school! Early morning shifts make for a very productive day and the shift tend to be short and everybody at ups is very nice!
good,"wait for trucks to come in and unload packages on to conveyor belt, receive and sort packages to corresponding conveyor belt. very fast paced on holidays, become a manager if possible for better pay and hours."
good,Great place to work unfortunately I had to leave due to the hours given no longer worked with my schedule. High pase environment only offers partime work though
good,The company was a great stepping stone for receiving training in the office environment for a  young associate.  It provided excellent administrative/customer service relationship skills.
good,"Go in to be prepared for work and work only , Be Respectful & Be Careful Because they do have some Heavy equipment.. Make Sure You Bring Water . wear close toe shoes"
good,"UPS package handler is a hard work, fast paced and labor intensive job. You need to be able to be on your feet constantly, lift heavy packages to some heights of about 5 1/2 feet. Additionally need to be able to have a good work ethic and be safe all the time due to vehicles, machinery and other moving objects throughout the building."
good,"UPS likes to throw all these good things in your face but in my case, things are a bit different and difficult. The pay is amazing and the benefits are good. BUT I applied for a facility in Fontana that barely has hours. If you get hired on be sure to say FIRST SHIFT! If you do not then people from first shift can finish most of the work leaving second shift with nothing. I do not like having to travel to other facilities to work I already live in Hesperia and am traveling to Fontana to work and I did not plan on traveling to different places to get a full 8 hours. I still work here but I feel like I might leave only because the hours are not consistent and sometimes they won't have work and you can be off for a day or 2. I never got a full 40 hours of work ever since I started. The management is really nice and funny and cool to work with and the coworkers are also friendly and funny. If UPS was consistent I would definitely stay but now I feel I am wasting gas to work for a place not consistent."
good,"Basically when you start off at UPS you will be working as either a loader or unloader, and you will get like 3.5 to 4 hours in the beginning. Also they take out $25 out of your check for 6 months for the Union fee."
good,UPS has its challenges at work. It’s a fast pace environment but also promotes safe work ethics and health tips weekly. It’s a part time job but offers other opportunities.
good,It was a great job while I had it they lead you on thinking you will make the union but you get laid off after Christmas and still pay union dues it’s a great paying career if you make the union
good,"Work was easy. If you don't follow supervisor's recommendation and goal for the day, they get emotional. I learned to be more organized. Management is not that bad. They stand by their workplace culture. hardest part was getting up at 3am. made friends outside of work."
good,Ups around peak season can be a very detrimental experience of you’re not careful. Boxes or hardware can fall on you if you’re not following the procedures . Overall it’s a very simple excercising job !
good,"what at ups was be safe at work and drink water"
good,"Não há rotina na empresa, podemos participar de diversas atividades, o que acaba sendo uma boa experiência."
good,i dont know what to sayy but everything is fair. Management is good. work environment is fair. Salary is fair. Employees are fair. everything is fair!
good,UPS has a solid workplace culture and the benefits are supposedly great. As an intern I only had the opportunity to work for a few months but the people that worked there made a great impression on me.
good,"The job in itself is not all that hard, just move the freight to where it needs to go. The real problem comes in with the supervisors that you get. In the 2 years that I worked there I went through 3 terminal managers and 8 dock supervisors. The people they hire never seem to have worked on a dock before and generally take a long time to get caught up to speed."
good,"I was very stressed out badly there. On some days my depression would be very high. But it was very fast pace and things would get moving if we could find the right groove. And if someone's trailer got stuck up or began to overflow, we would go over there and help out."
good,"Walk inside the warehouse , Greet co-workers Im familiar with , then go to my line where Im assigned by team supervisor and unload the trucks until break time comes, then eat with few co-workers , talk after we done then its back to work at the end of the day. Hardest part of the day to me after 12, after I eat cause lifting after eating after you've lifted a meal, isn't ideal to me but we stick through it. The most enjoyable part of Ups is just , laughing with the guys , Its hand-on so a lot interacting with each other. Its a good job , but if your not willing to work hard , its not for you"
good,"I worked from 5-9 Monday through Friday and loaded trailers with packages. I had to hit 400 packages an hour , which was 2000 packages a day.  Keeping a fast paste at UPS was mandatory."
good,"The job was pretty fast past and straight forward. You came in on time and you left whenever the managers let you, usually when the work is done. You work individual or by yourself depending on how much work there is."
good,I don't really have much to say because it was years ago and the call center to my knowing is no longer in existence.  I was thankful for the opportunity to work
good,"A good job and pays very well. Excellent Employees and a very good place for high schoolers to work and have a couple cash in they pockets, but a little downfall is lifting mostly heavy boxes that’s up to 70lbs-150lbs"
good,"It was a good job, I could not survive off of the pay. So I left and have had to relocate jobs. Everyone there was some sort of professional. I would honestly go back and work as a pick off."
good,"Coming onto a jobsite and being ready for the days challenges, before getting to work is a mindset and working at UPS definitely provides the inherent experience to enhance tis characteristic. This job helped fuel my determination to excel and in so doing has positively influenced my growth and development. This and jobsites like it create dedicated and focused individuals that will succeed when their mind is on the prize. Thank you UPS."
good,The Management will work hard with you along side to ensure the best service possible is delivered to all its Customer's. The option is there to earn more money assisting Drivers with their deliveries as well.
good,"While I was there the building was still beig built so there wasn't a lot of organization but typically you have a set scheduele for the week depending on your shift and then you go to your assigned section and wait for the mini meeting when everyone arrives and then depending on the volume of packages you get, you will be loading boxes varying from 2 pounds all the way up to 200 pounds into trailers with a specific destination and then once your load is done you get to clock out but there is no specific end time. Some days you are only there for 2 hours compared to other days where you are there for 12 hours."
good,it is a pretty good job. Somewhat stressful. Lots of packages to load. Sometimes it just never stop coming. It's a good workout. I will work there again. After you get past the one-year. They have pretty good benefits. Soon the pay will be more as well
good,"Just unloading trucks all night. Learned patience, management is not the best; mostly bad, rarely good. Depressing work culture. I like my coworkers though, you meet a lot of great people."
good,The work you do is definitely not worth the amount of money you make an hour. You have to work there for years in order to see a good amount of money.
good,"UPS is a hard working and fast-paced environment. It does require a lot of strength to work at UPS, but determination is all that counts. Being able to follow instructions and do the job correctly goes a long way to being the best at UPS. The hardest part of the job is doing the same thing day in and day out, constantly being exhausted. They do a terrible job at keeping employees safe from dangers inside the building and the weather"
good,Very fast pace and difficult work to do. Must be in good shape. In the two weeks I was there I saw employee come in and leave the same day. The hours are great for what you have to do because no one could do this for 8 hours a day.
good,"Basically, it will start off as a lot of hard physical work. When I first started it was really the hottest part of the summer. Once your training is done they will probably start you out in the load or unload jobs. Then when some employees quit, get fired or move to full time they will move you around to other areas. Some days are good and some are rough like any other job."
good,"Typical day at work: Helping customers package their shipments. Process their shipments through the system and accept daily drop offs. Manage mailbox holders by processing mail and packages. Manage house accounts, order supplies for front of store and back. Notary services and livescans. Accept print jobs and run them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the actual job responsibilities and the fast pace environment. Also, creating relationships with customers is very rewarding. The hardest part about the job is when shipments are no longer in our possession and there has been an error that was not our fault, the customers come to us because we are the face that they saw last."
good,Fast paced environment loading and unloading trucks. Good coworkers and team work involved and excellent management stayed involved with hands on training.
good,"A typical work at UPS Warehouse we load packages into truck for delivery, lifted heavy equipment orders, and boxed efficiency to maximize space. The workplace culture could be a little dangerous that's why we were require to load a certain way for our protections, the hardest part of the job was working in a very hot climate while trying to get our task done. The most enjoyable part of job for me is that I was among a great staff, we did work together and management did step in to assist when we were short on loaders."
good,"I had to quit after working at UPS on and off since 2012. You body just breaks down over the years and really the state can help you pay for education rather than breaking ya neck to keep up with production at a place like UPS. The state also provide better health insurance then at UPS believe it or not, making working there not that much necessary unless you just like working extremely hard *shrug*. The upside is if you work over 4 1/2 hours you get paid double and you do get paid vacations when you work there a year+."
good,I think the pay could of been better and they could of gave more hours it was fast paced but it’s like you work hard for nothing I made the best out of it
good,"Atypical day at UPS is that I would start the day stretching. then from there, I would clock-in and put on my belt-scanner and digi. I learned that people who work/worked at UPS are very hard workers.  the management was extremely very well managed. I worked in a warehouse. the hardest part of the job was the pace of work in order for it to be done correctly and smoothly. the most enjoyable part of it was meeting new people and getting a great workout in."
good,I left ups because the manger was moving me to a different trailer and I didn’t have time to finish mines. And when I went to mines everything was all over the place and I had a lil bite of time
good,"Typical day started with me heading to my truck and doing a circle check around the truck. Ensuring that all turn signals and break lights are in good working order.  The oil and all fluids, windshields are topped up as well as the tire pressure. Once complete the I would have to scan the packages in the truck are all on board by doing a physical count making sure that 8 of 8 pieces art there. Any express packages on board would need to be delivered first due to time sensitivity. by about 3:00pm the package picks would start."
good,They should remember that the most important asset are people.
good,I was working nights. I love working there it was pretty lay back no rush. Had good supervision that was willing to work with you on anything. Unload truck was my job. Just try the label up. An put them on the belt. Off they went it was kinda sweet at times. Just left early.
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with torn boxes which will slow up my production and load quality.  Management at times are not working with common sense and continue to hire part-time supervisors that are not capable of given a helping hand. Most part-time supervisors leave the role as pre-loader mainly because they do not like loading the trucks and are lazy. Working with part-time supervisors that doesn't understand load quality and weren't good loaders make the job difficult at times.
good,"A normal day at UPS can either be extremely stressful or pretty laid back. You never know what to expect when you walk in. The hours at "
good,UPS is a very good place to start a career because there is room to grow and the management system is well put together. UPS also has great benefits to offer.
good,I worked at the UPS Logistics out on outerloop in Louisville KY.  Hot in the summer in the warehouse. Land fill across the street which you could smell all day.
good,"Stay hydrated at all times, try your best to finish on time with ur shift to get your hours done ,try to work has a team and always put a good example and always but always work safety"
good,"Company is great to work for, but advancement is difficult. Many people work there for years before being promoted. Fast paced environment. Not knowing what kind of work day you're going to have; very random."
good,Very fast paced production driven company. Opportunity for advancement but competitive for management positions. Great benefits for all positions but takes a year to receive.
good,Learned great warehouse job experience and tips. Thought me a lot about a work environment overall and how to work in a habitat where there are a lot of people.
good,"I worked here to gain clerical training and experience hoping to be paid well and advance my career. But the pay is low, so were the hours per day. The management was very friendly and always interactive & there to help if you needed something! The employees weren't very good at communicating but the job always got done."
good,"Good for those who like lots of physical labor (loaders & drivers) and extreme multitasking (inside office). It was very stressful on the inside dealing with phone calls, drivers and boss calls. I ended up getting physically sick from all the stress. Had to leave to follow my passion."
good,"The culture at UPS breeds a very competitive environment, as each service provider/manager looks to obtain credit for every act that benefits UPS and diminish the work of others to look more productive. The fast paced environment grants you the skill to hit the ground running and think on your feet, a skill that can be transposed to any job role. UPS is not entirely in tune with their EEO training or standards, as it is only a formality that EEO is touched upon with every employee. UPS does not practice what they preach and only their ideas of tolerance are enforced, not objectively what tolerance should be. Managers are forced to work part-time in multiple shifts and get paid less than the employees they manage: The Drivers. "
good,"UPS is a great company to work for once you get past your 90 day probation period. The training process is essentially “teach new hires the safety rules, give a general idea how the work goes, and then throw them to the wolves”. The benefits are amazing and you receive them after a year of work. The work is quick paced but bearable if you have a decent supervisor. If you have a bad supervisor, it quickly gets out of hand. The hub I work at specifically, cares more about production than quality and its sadly very apparent. The volume that comes through is almost 4x’s what our building was made for. Conveyor belts become overloaded often, sections become horribly understaffed, and the workers that occupy certain positions are usually poorly trained and either can’t keep up or don’t know what is going on. Keep in mind I specifically said this is the hub I work at. Otherwise its a great company to work for with multiple opportunities for advancement and usually has inclusive events to celebrate safety records and production records."
good,Your typical work day is most like going to work stacking boxes and going home sometimes being sent home without working at but overall a ok place to start if looking for your first job
good,"no major complaints. pretty much what you expect from working at UPS. good people to work with, lots of opportunity to grow. they provide you with everything you need to perform your duties."
good,"Unless you plan on becoming a supervisor, engineer, truck driver or you just don't need full time hours, I wouldn't recommend it. Package Handlers don't make enough money."
good,"People here are great and days go by quickly because it's constant movement. The pay is very low, not many hours and it's very physically demanding. Good as a temporary solution between jobs or if you want to go to school. Not career material however. Takes way too long to see any financial benefit."
good,report to twilight shift around 5 or 530 then you are assigned a trailer. Given a scanner to scan each box and make a wall out of them. Employees receive a 10 minute paid break. Usually shift ends around 930 or 10
good,"incompetent supervisors. The get in your face, steal money from your checks, fire you for things they can't fire you for and gets very defensive when you spit business law to them."
good,Following all safety rules.Setting up work areas correctly.Able to lift objects weighing from 70 or more pounds.Have to stand up through your whole shift.No breaks because if your non sertifide then you are considered temporary.
good,"If you like working outside in a fast-paced environment, this job is for you. If you can learn quickly and be receptive, you'll do well. I found it stressful, but that doesn't mean it will be for you."
good,"ups is a fantastic place to work with the tuition reibursurbement  one cant afford to leave that. plus the management team that i work with is outstanding, i couldnt ask for a more patient and understanding person as a boss.it gives me great satisfaction to know that i belong to such a company."
good,"A typical day is coming in at 11pm, and sorting packages to the right zip code until 1:05am then you get a 10 minute break. Then you come back and sort packages again until about 2:30-3:30."
good,The Union does not make a great deal for employees. No benefits until after a year and the pay is penny’s. Other than that you may get a great Suporvisor the schedule is flexible so that’s a great thing I suppose.
good,"My part was just the cashier and it never was stressful, management was very laid back, the only hard part about the shop is boxing the object the customers are bringing in but the most enjoyable part of my job was my breaks."
good,The best part about this job for me was the fact that I worked with a driver and it was just the two of us for hours. It was simple straight forward and clear to the point that it just made itself an enjoyable job.
good,"UPS is a joke. They dont tell you ,you have a quota of 1000 scans a shift. Its hard, fast paced work. I couldnt handle the lifting of over 50 pounds witjout accomodation."
good,It was fast pace work but made time go by fast. New manager made working difficult. Very short breaks but it was a part time job. If you worked there for a certain time you'll receive good benefits.
good,"The job is easy though very fast paced and extremely physical. Nice management,The worst part of the job is the physical stress. The best part of the job is the benefits and the advancement opportunities."
good,"Worth it for a part time job in the long term"
good,"overall my experience at UPS was not bad at all, the hours were demanding but other than that the work itself was not bad at all. management was great they really advocate for hard work paying off internally there and it was a learning experience overall. i would recommended the job to anyone who like physical labor."
good,In my short time at UPS I'd show up knowing I'd have to get a lot of work done. I worked as a sorter of packages between 1-70 pounds. At the beginning my supervisors would go through the process but once I got the hang of it I was pretty independent.
good,"Typical day at UPS was adjust to the start times daily while working fast but safe."
good,"UPS was a fast paced environment that encouraged growth in order to keep up with daily demands. Where they lacked in salary, they made up for in benefits."
good,"They job is rapidly expanding and is opening a lot of doors for advancement and development. New buildings are being built, so the need for new management is needed. This opens a lot of doors for new comers to advance quickly if they desire."
good,"Very much concentrated on cost savings, producing good results. Good benefits and pay.  Tough place to work during Christmas season long hours.  If you are willing to work hard then this can be a successful career."
good,"Overnight shifts, my shift started at 3am. During peak season my shift would start at midnight and always end at 9am. Management was great always on point, willing to help you load truck if you had fallen behind. Hardest part of the job was getting there everyday at 3 in the morning."
good,"It was a great place to work. my job sercuirty "
good,"Easy place to work if willing to put in some physical labor. Fun work environment. Great place for college students or just people looking for a part time job. Paid weekly. Health, dental, 401k, and other benefits are available after a year."
good,Very hardwork yet rewarding. I worked there because they paid for school which was great idea and plan. They sometimes thy to overwork you but you don't have to allow
good,A normal day consisted of tracking packages and talking to customers about their packages. The only hard part is being patient with customers who are frustrated or in a rush.
good,"When starting out at UPS you are constantly reminded of the benefits that the job gives out after a certain period of employment, such as the health benefits after one year or the 10 year compensation check.  These are useful and motivational for those who invest their time into this company. However, if you do not plan to work within the company to achieve a higher position such as becoming a supervisor or manager I do not recommend."
good,Great Benefits and good potential to move up within the company. I do however wish the company would work on more time for employees to spend with family.
good,Working at UPS had provided the experience of a structured work environment that is operated and guided by deadlines. Qualities such and efficiency and prioritization I have learned at UPS that has relevance in the medical field.
good,i found myself doing 3 jobs at once every night cause they knew if i worked really hard i can get it done which i did. i just figure if your doing more jobs they should recognize it more instead of taking it for granted.
good,Easy job once you get your muscles used to the work. Nice supplemental income and usually needed if you plan on trying to drive a package car. Union keeps you mostly safe.
good,UPS can be a very profiting company to work for in the long run but the working conditions are harsh especially in phoenix summers. It Is also only part time.
good,"The job is physically challenging but has great benefits I learned that you have to stay energized, HYDRATED, and remember to stretch. Best benefit is that college tuition is paid 100% but the job can be really challenging and intense, it requires lots of energy and ability to lift boxes, I have came home with bruises because of the fact that there is so much movement and large packages. there can be some serious back pain which is why it is good to remember to bend your knees but it can be difficult to when your focused on getting those packages out properly. People are nice there but they encourage you to be aggressive somewhat and it is a very competitive work environment. I do like the fact that I get my college experience paid for but the job itself can be difficult, most people who work there are there for the benefits. This jobs suits anyone who loves physically challenging job positions and loves to sweat a lot."
good,Working at UPS was fine. The job is very tiring and is a bit of a workout as a package handler. There is a bit of a hustle that comes with the job and if you can't keep up then you could potentially lose your job. It's definitely a job you don't want to stay at long.
good,"BBQ every Monday"
good,I would unload boxes.I learned to work as a team. Management was nice.The hardest part was getting there . Never really had any issues . The most Enjoyable was the people.
good,"overall good company a lot of hardwork the job is not easy must get a good rest and stretch before work, very friendly environment very competitive very fast paste"
good,"Great Job really demanding at times and communication between management and driver can be extremely frustrating. However, the benefits and pay are amazing and defiantly worth the time and effort."
good,"Not all supervisors are bad, but there are some that make working there very unpleasant. New supervisors don't have the maturity to be in those spots."
good,"its a good place for young guys to work, good environment have room to grow not long hours you are getting a workout as well so no need to go to the gym"
good,"UPS is a hard job, but if you stick through it you could really become something there. Overall it was a good experience. Unfortunately do to my ankle I couldn't stay longer, but I would deffinetly recommend it to others."
good,As long as you deliver by the methods you should have a descent day depending on how your truck is loaded. Customer  interaction is the highlight of your day.  Lunch breaks are hard to take at times. But knowing your routes demographics helps with your time management.
good,They only give you like a 15 min break time out of how hard they work you that's is unreasonable. However the supervisor are cool to reason with the workers
good,Great company with great benefits but the managers or not the greatest people in the world. I think they forget we are people and act as if your a machine. They don't care for the people that work there. Just do the work and shut up kind of attitude
good,Management is okay depending on the individual but with being part time transfer available to full time after 1year of seniority health benefits strong union protection paid vacation and overtime after 5 hour a day it's a good part time gig.
good,"UPS is a pretty good place with outstanding benefits. However, at times, it would get very difficult to balance school with the job because of the hours worked. For an hourly, the job is pretty flexible, but make sure you are ready if you want to move up the ladder and become a part-time supervisor."
good,"La empresa es muy buena,,para el trabajo q yo hice,se paga muy poco,es muy pesado fisicamente,y dan pocas horas."
good,The job has its ups and downs. The only real benefit/enjoyable thing there is if you put up with the poor management enough to move up in the company as well as their benefits. Possibly become a feeder driver or package cart driver then it may be worth it.
good,ups is a good place to work if you need extra money it very fast paste and the work is non stop if you are ready for physical labor that demands a lot i do not recommend this job for you
good,"UPS is an American logistics company with their air freight across the globe and has their back office in India, i have worked in their Pune office for 8 months and after completing my graduation in International business i started working there. It was a back office work with a desk job and complete excel work with some report generation work. They had different teams with different grades starting from the lowest grade 7. Salary they give to freshers was good and a way to make more freshers apply in the company as they maintain a high attrition rate because of less growth opportunity and more buttering work there with managers."
good,UPS Revenue Recovery is weighing and scanning packages to make sure businesses get there packages delivered to them safe and on time. And UPS provides great benefit and also good health care for you and your family.
good,"It is a very good job and has a lot of benefits, which I think is great. We work hard everyday and produce the best of me to up lift ups more so they can still be the ups they are."
good,"A day at UPS is a Straight through your shift. I learned from this Job different city states zip codes. Far as management goes there are tons of supervisors per pd. Work place Culture warehouse, dull, busy, Team work. Hardest part is working through no break. Most enjoyable part is working in teams."
good,Was an employer then got into management was a regular supervisor then got promoted to head supervisor over all partime management personal also was in place to be head supervisor of entire plant
good,"Much needed communication,  Needs to expand to a bigger facility due to growth, Needs more Supervisors to Manage current employees, dock workers be prepared to bid for a different shift every six months"
good,"UPS had a very competitive benefits program and you were compensated well as far as income.  It was difficult to balance work and home life.  This job is very demanding which is fine however they were very long days. The supervisors were great to work with as well as the management team. "
good,i like this job but they were very unprofessional and very messy here nobody got time for that people come to work not make friends and i just didn't like the setting
good,"Good starting work place."
good,It's was A nice environment to encounter with. The people there are very nice. And it's very strick there . You aren't aloud to be in your phone at any time and I respect that. Working there you get free healthcare .
good,Hard work but rewarding and there is plenty of room to grow in the company. Comradery among employees and management. Great benefits and packages for retirement.
good,"From my experience, I learned the many different area codes around the country. Also, I learned how to work better in a team setting, building connections with my co-workers. Finally, I learned that I am capable of committing to a fast pace environment."
good,"Too much stuff going on at one time & it's real messy. I get no hours & my check sucks. What I signed up for isn't what it seems. I don't want to work anywhere, where I'm not comfortable"
good,"Grown Ups” is a pleasant, genial, good-hearted, sometimes icky comedy that's like spending a weekend with well-meaning people you don't want to see again any time real soon. ... Try to imagine the Three Stooges slapping each other's faces with dehydrated reconstituted bananas."
good,A typical day at work would be bounced around from PD to PD because of your pace.   The hardest part about this job is not staying at the same pace you started with . always moving quick with no rest. you only get a 10 min break during  your part time shift .
good,"Highly physical job and the starting pay is not great, however raises are given twice a year. Benefits kick in after one year and are fantastic, they are included through your union dues."
good,UPS is a wonderful organization to establish a career with. Many people have climbed the ranks(being hired on a part-time basis) just by working hard and being dependable. The benefits alone are an incentive to work for UPS.
good,"Typical workday is very busy, fast paced,but learning environment.  Enjoy team work, and assisting co workers when deemed necessary.  The hardest part of the job is being tasks when no guidance or policy/procedures.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with new people, working in a diverse environment and learning a new skill with the ability to successfully reach the company goals and expectations."
good,"working at a good pace"
good,"I started at BCP as a teller. After a few months, thanks to my dedication and co-workers support I was promoted to Quality Coordinator. I was to ensure that all customer service representatives followed company guidelines and procedures. "
good,During my time at united parcel service I Learned a lot. I actually would still be there if I hadn't been offered a better position elsewhere. The working Associates use team work well helped me learn how to work with teams.
good,"Typical day at work would be lifting/lowering on average 35 pound boxes and making walls."
good,"All I did was load trucks. I learned how lift with my back better. I honestly think that the management could have worked a little harder, but it was a nice experience."
good,"frustrating, early morning starts."
good,Very fast paced and management is only concerned with your packages per hour rate. You don't receive benefits until after a year. They try to slowly break you in for a month but honestly the work is hard.
good,Great for students and people who have a schedule to work around. Bad if your would like to advance in the company. Several times I had been told that there would be a management position for me at the next opening and then they would hire someone else. I would talk to the manager about at least giving me an interview and he had said he would yet never did and hired someone else.
good,Work was from 3am-9am. I would supervise the employees make sure they are working safely. co workers and employees were cool. most enjoyable part was getting the trucks out on time.
good,"Working at UPS was a very fun experience. At work I would be the one to call the shots even though i was not a supervisor. My part time supervisors have told me I was the best that they have seen in a long time. Unfortunately I did not get along with a group of co-workers and my full time supervisor, which ultimately ended in me leaving to focus on completing school."
good,"A great company, overall growth is minimum but the work environment and management was satisfying. I learned a lot about myself and acquired many skills such as time management and team building skills."
good,"a typical day at work is hard working. "
good,"Position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh 25-35 lbs and may weigh up to 70 lbs. "
good,"Als Niederlassungsleiter hatte ich mir erst den Betriebsbericht vom Vortag angesehen und Schwächen herausgearbeitet. Danach hatte ich das Teamleiter-Meeting geleitet. Während der Nachtsortierung hatte ich überprüft ob die Teamleiter mit den Mitarbeitern arbeiteten. Gerne hatte ich mit den Asylbewerbern und Studenten der unterschiedlichsten Nationen gearbeitet."
good,"Audited incoming packages and out going packages, Applied correct shipping labels on all packages. performed quality checks on packages"
good,it was challenging at first and strenuous on the body but after a couple of months everything became routine the co workers there will probably be the best people you'll ever meet
good,Inside the building its is hotter inside than it is outside and in the winter it is just as cold inside as it is outside. The management team does not communicate well with each other.
good,"Everyday is a challenge at UPS. While working for this company, I've learned the benefits of working together as a unit to maintain productivity and meeting the requirements of our customers.With many new business opportunities, our Management team face many challenges daily as well making it even more challenging for them to interact with the team. My team members and I, realizing this, found value in working as a unit. The most challenging part of my job is making the best decisions to keep our customers satisfied and to meet our annual business plan in the most efficient manor possible. What's most rewarding about my job is knowing that we have met our goals at the end of each day."
good,"This was my very first job.This job was most definitely about teamwork. I loved this job, I actually learned a lot at this job."
good,I would unload and load trucks. making sure packages where placed on the correct belt for a proper and speedy delievery.
good,The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions and failure of communication from the management. The most enjoyable is the yearly pay increase and the health benefits.
good,"I would load 3 package vans 5 days a week,pulling packages off of a moving conveyer belt and placed packages in appropriate shelves in vans. got along with co-workers and management. no hard parts of work, I looked forward to coming in every day."
good,"I worked the early morning shift during the holiday season in 2014 and I have to say, it was an experience. It was very very (let me stress this) VERY fast paced and at times things got a bit hectic. The management was good, and the training was always somewhere nearby, not to see if you're messing up, but to make sure you're doing okay. UPS tends to promote from within, so many, if not all, line supers and line management have been down in the trenches where you are."
good,"Working at UPS allows me to build strong relationships with my coworkers and management. This company provides great benefits and job security, but can become so hectic major safety concerns tend to fall second to overall productivity. The opportunities provided by UPS are achievable through hard work and passion."
good,Very Diverse and fast paste environment. The hardest part of the job was stacking those heavy boxes on top of one another.
good,good place to learn new things and meet some good people. the pay could be better but the management and supervisors care for your well being.
good,"A typical day at work is constant nonstop physical work with very little time to get to know coworkers. Working in the environment gave me experience with changing and uncontrolled weather conditions and increased my safety and health awareness. The hardest part of the job was lifting several 40-65 pound boxes in a row to higher levels about 6'5 inches from the floor. I enjoyed the workout at times because I'm not always able to on my own time , I also appreciated the labor work experience."
good,"Working at UPS is awesome when you start your day."
good,"Started at 11.30pm finished at 1700approx"
good,a typical day is getting slammed with boxes and trying to keep my truck clean and building good tight walls to the top. As well as taking care of bulk packages which takes alot of strength.
good,"My typical work day is planned and organized on how I will properly train new employees on UPS safe work methods and job specific work functions. On a daily basis I look for innovating ways to help employees incorporate safety into their daily work while actively maintaining Company, OSHA and DOT guidelines. My team actively looks for ways to implement plans on reaching productivity, load quality, Cube Utilization and targeted loads.  I am skilled in customer service within the company and externally. I often utilize Microsoft Office and multi-tasking skills. I am self-motivated and use strong decision making skills which require accuracy and good judgment. Not only is self-motivation key there is a strong spirit of teamwork with my co-workers and myself, we actively seek more effective ways to assist in the achievement of universal company goals. The hardest part of my job is definitely maintaining new employees with attendance issues. What I have learned from UPS is my proactive approach to development and awareness of my skillset allow me to overcome any task. I have acquired a more flexible attitude to problem solving which allows me to bring solution based results. The aspects I enjoy are reaching company goals, tuition reimbursement, hourly compensation and knowing that I have done my job to the best of my abilities."
good,A typical day at work is I clock in and start work immediately. I learned how to load trucks and trailers as well as health tips. My management was alright In had no problems out of them. I personally knew my co-workers so that wasn't a problem. The hardest part of the job was loading the long trailers with almost 200 boxes. The most enjoyable day was break because loading all those boxes can be stressful.
good,"The working environment was great and everyone I worked with were amazing. The management was decent, but my only problem with UPS was that they lacked in employee heath and safety."
good,"Cant really review this company since I only worked for the season. The time I have been there wasn't bad, amazing mangers and average work environment."
good,"Working at UPS is probably exactly how you've heard it is. Dirty, hot in the summer, cold in the winter. The work part itself is not bad, but poor management mixed in with work conditions makes it not very lovable."
good,"If this is a second job that you are looking to coincide with another, this is actually the perfect place to be employed. However just to start out, a primary place of work is not a good consideration, because they just dont pay enough, great benefits though. Work is somewhat easy when you get it down, all it is would be the monotony of doing the same thing over and over."
good,I enjoyed working with UPS. I learned a lot and had a great supervisor to lead me. Hardest part of the job was the changing weather.
good,"Very hard working , Alot of competition , needed to be well hydrated. Keeps you very well in shape. Good pay but needs better raises."
good,"If you are young and ambitious, this is a great way to start a career to get management experience, while have your school tuition paid."
good,"Great customers"
good,I am a hard worker as well as a fast learner. I am very goal orientated and a people's person. A typical day at work I may sure Im always doing something and never have to much down time because we're always working on a tight schedule. I make sure everything is cleaned and no packages left behind. I work so fast I have time to help other employees with their work
good,This was probably one of my least favorite jobs i have had. as far as the work environment goes it wasn't a bad place other then the few people that i had arguments with including one of my mangers
good,"Takes to long to start making money and get benefits. Learned to handle hazmat materials, learned proper use of equipment , co workers were very friendly"
good,Loading outgoing mail is productive and fitness ready. It helps one to maintain fitness.
good,The job was not hard it was a good job. The co-workers were fine. There was not a hard part of the job.
good,"The other co-workers are great to work with, The hardest part was the amount of work to get done in such a short amount of time. The typical day was fast, and heavy with a lot of work to get done. The best part of the job was the people that I met, and the benefits."
good,Once employed there is a 90 day  period to either become a union or non-union employee.  After a year the benefits are available which is the most redeeming quality of the job and pay rate.  Since it is union based employment for all warehouse staff any advancements were seniority based.
good,"I would get myself set up along the conveyor slide where I would receive customer boxes after they'd travel down by way of the conveyor belt. I would have to lift the boxes, match the color acronym  on the box label with the color coded box shelf behind me. This color coded box shelf would travel down to the truck loaders where they'd load the boxes onto to the truck according to the color code in the delivery truck. I learned great hand-eye coordination and how to use this skill in a fast paced environment. My co workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the small work space but I adapted to the change. The most enjoyable part about the job was I got the chance to get to know new people."
good,"Hard work, but nice benefits Ok place it prefect for college students or some extra cash"
good,"Review plan of daily activities"
good,"Loaders would have to scan various packages and load them into trucks for delivery. On average a loader could scan and load anywhere between 1,500 to 2,500 packages in a night"
good,Keeps you busy the whole time there.Loading and unloading boxes of all sizes.Like building walls
good,I just wished that the job was more organized and the communication was better as well pay and hours
good,"Worked 4:30 am to 8am shift unloading tractor trailers, working the small sort area and loading/unloading air cams."
good,"It was interesting to see how packages were shipped and the whole process. Typical day at work was to up load a huge truck full of small boxed (usually phones and phone batteries)."
good,"Unloaded trucks all shift within the an expected time"
good,Clock into work and immediately starting loading packages from a slide into a uniformed wall structure. I learned how to perform my job at a fast pace that would still be beneficiary to the company and to myself without obtaining any injuries. Management always made sure that we used safely equipment and made sure that we knew what to do in case of certain emergencies. Hardest part was receiving a lot of packages at once and not having sufficient help to clear the rollers. Enjoyable part was leaving work knowing that I made good uniformed walls and they would travel safely to the desired destination.
good,"it will be some-day's that you will enjoy, and days you won't enjoy it at all."
good,"Working with very good technical team."
good,"1)  Train New Employees"
good,this is a good place to work as a first job. The hardest part of the job is the working conditions. The work is very repetitive and hard on the body.
good,"I worked at the UPS store as a my first job.  The job required that the employees be good at multitasking.  Unfortunately for me, being my first job and all, I was pretty lousy at it.  I was responsible for taking orders, sorting mail, weighing light packages, wrapping packages, stocking the store, cleaning, and occasionally advertising by waving street signs.  Although it was exciting at first, it quickly became overwhelming, and I was laid off, on good terms thankfully.  "
good,UPS has been a great job to work for! The people who will benefit from working at UPS will be college students who need a set work schedule and steady pay! Working there has taught that hard work is must to advance and secure a long time position in either management or as a driver.
good,"UPS is a great place to work with poor management. The pay is great, benefits are great but the work environment is very stressful to work in."
good,"UPS is a good job to work at. It has great benefits. It is a safe and productive company as long as you fllow the rules. Co workers can be very helpful in getting the job done. Team work can play a major role at UPS, working together can also get the job done. "
good,Typical day arrive at work around 3:00 A.M. Samething everyday unload 2 to 3 trailer. Management pretty laid back form time to time. When around summer it get hot so it make my job hard and long. But i do enjoy the break we have. That the only time i really get to see my coworkers.
good,"Great company, job security however there needs to be improvement for managemet."
good,my family and i are looking for a climate change and wish to move to florida. We have family there. ups is a good job but a career change is necessary for our hopeful move
good,It is a teamwork enviroment.YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR CONSTANT FLOW AND BE ENERGETIC.
good,At this job i was responsible daily for delivering packages doing at least 90 stops a day. Ups delivery drivers experience a lot of busy days and sometimes its so busy and hard to get all packages delivered we cant even take lunch at times. I've learned a lot more about defensive driving and i guarantee that anyone who has done this job before or currently doing this job is a profession driver. The company does a good job on training employers to become a professional driver but they dont do good enough with training employees on how to get the job done.
good,"I worked 1st shift at UPS, but the time veried from 5am to 7am, we never really knew when we were supposed to come in exactly, we were always told of the time change at the last minute, I worked 40 to 60 hours a week besides that, I had good co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is chaotic, but you learn a lot of valuable skills. There is opportunity for advancement if you like high stress jobs."
good,"Physical labor, great team work. Can be challenging on a physical level but can be overcome with the help of co-workers. The experience a gained from it is that as a team, even the hardest task can be the simplest."
good,My job at UPS was seperating boxes by zip codes from the conveyor belt. All my co-workers I worked with were cool to get along with. The hardest part of my job was making sure every box I got was the correct zip code. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing up all my work.
good,Umload/Sort from beginning to end. I learned how packages get sorted to get to their destination. Management was okay. great coworkers. Sorting packages at a very fast pace to the color coded belt associated with that zip code.
good,"Helped the driver deliver packages to homes and offices. It required us to sometimes walk up very long drive ways to peoples homes. You always have to be nice,respectful to others and be curtious as well"
good,"Hard job, very high demand of work quality. Great Benefits, and advancement opp."
good,"UPS is a great company with excellent healthcare benefits. UPS has allowed me to grow and gain valuable work experience with Microsoft Word and Excel, Customer Service, and work of my Spanish Translation. Due to my length of time with UPS, i have developed long lasting friendships forged by our common goal to make UPS successful. The most difficult part of my job is the physical work required to work at UPS. Despite, the physical requirements, Working with great individuals make the work seem simple and enjoyable."
good,Fast paced and hard work. Full-time work done in part-time hours.
good,i have a really good time to work with ups but had family issue to i left ups and the country
good,On your feet constanly moving gettung things done with a lit to accomplish
good,Your job consists of loading and unloading boxes while scanning. It is a repetitive job but it keeps you sweating and busy. Don't have much time to socialize. Friendly co-workers for the most part.
good,"days seem long until you get three to five months in to the job. the managers are organized, friendly and on top of things. co-workers are friendly as well as easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job is keeping up the pace for the entire shift."
good,very fast paste work environment. The co-workers are very nice. You must be very time oriented.The hardest part about the job would have to be the holidays.
good,"I had worked at UPS for a little of 5 years total, which 3 of those years I was package clerk and later was promoted to part-time supervisor, where upon I finished the remainder of the 2 years as a Part-time supervisor."
good,This is a very physical job to do but it can be rewarding since they promote newly hired people to management very quickly. it is a very physical job and it takes a lot of work but can be rewarding to you when you apply yourself.
good,"If you become a favorite of management, it's not a bad place to work. They are constantly promoting from within. Fast paced day and great tuition reimbursement. Down fall is there is a lot of male to female harassment that they ignore. Employees constantly get hurt and they try to sweep it under the rug and make you keep working"
good,"Great company to work for! However, long days, no breaks (or few breaks), no bathroom breaks unless you just ask and have to go that bad, don't know when your working each day, don't know the start and end time, they can change you around to other drivers, so you may not be with the one you start out with. I think a career with UPS is a wise decision, but if there's not any open positions then you likely leave this job looking for a job."
good,I recommend anyone looking to work hard and be rewarded for your efforts also receiving good pay give them a try you get paid to work out and learn to work as a team.
good,The overall workplace is fair the people there wasn’t bad at all. I felt safe about coming to work and working on the work site. It’s a slight job i guess
good,The Manager are very nice and helpful and don’t play about there job. The culture of the work place might not be the best just dress for what ever the weather feels like.
good,I had a good time working there every thing was ok. The hardest part was standing on your feet for most of the night. I learned to work good with a team.
good,"The job functions in the accounting department are simply entry level. Most of your day consists of auditing orders. There are opportunities from AP and AR work to month end journals.The company as a whole though is not worth your time. The management does not listen to employees suggestions, and the environment feels tense. There is no employee morale due to this. The most enjoyable part is knowing you come home with a paycheck each week."
good,Unless you’re a full time manager or supervisor you will only get about 3 hours a day and it can get really busy and hot at times but the hourly pay isn’t bad
good,"Being a driver's helper was exciting, however, you must be ready to work and be active. Laziness is slacking is not for UPS workers. The culture is fine."
good,"this job is intense and fast paced. expect a lot from just 1 worker , and want you to be done by a certain time with no breaks. its labor work and if you need a seasonal or part time job this is for you"
good,"If you are looking for some extra cash. Check out UPS! After a certain period of time (9 months), you get FREE benefits! They care about their employees health and safety. This would've been a great job for me, but unfortunately I cannot afford my bills by just working this job. :( But, highly recommend!"
good,I work about 3.5 hours at ups Monday through Friday I unload the trailers filled with packages and load trucks with packages also do data corrections.
good,very hard working job for anyone looking for a job with ups. also we only get a 10min break the whole day we are working for 4-6 hours but very good with benefits if you stay with them
good,"Working at UPS required a lot of physical labor. The pay was not great for the work required. Although, working here taught me dedication and perseverance."
good,They never answer the phone and the staff are kind of rude.Also they aren’t that organized in there.I called my manager to tell her I needed to call out and she got smart with me and said what do I want her to do .
good,"If you're working in the warehouse, be aware that management will push you to your breaking point! Remember you are a union employee, those supervisors and management are NOT your friends! They really don't care about you as long as they meet their production quotas. Also keep track of your time and pay because I know first hand they will mess up your paycheck almost every week!"
good,Typically my day starts with planning the calls for the day and also following up on customer commitments. I need to work with different UPS internal departments to get the job done for my customers.
good,"The hours were long. The pay wasnt worth the work I had to do. There was never much employee apprecation shown. Even though, I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,I Did not like the environment nor the people I worked with. Everyone is in a very dull mood and just wants to do there job and get out of there. Great benefits.
good,"Good company to work for, would recommend to other people if they like working on the computer for 8 hours a day. Managers are pretty nice people to work with."
good,I worked at the UPS STORE in Flint. The customers were awful. I was forced to close the store at 16 years old. SUPER illegal. The worst part is that these are franchise owned.
good,very fast paced and stressful to the wrong person. good management for the most part. Good benefits and work life balance if you are careful. most enjoyable part is the downtime at work.
good,"Good company, but harsh and unstable work environment.  Opportunity for advancement but not merited by your work ethic versus relationships with your immediate supervisor. Part time work has hours capped and rarely able to work more than allotted"
good,The position doesn’t be stable the mangers dont give great assistance bad management u can’t go on break until the tell you or u want get a break working wise is no problem but the mangers are rude
good,"I always say come in and do your job. But I will never work for a union based company again. Union covers good employees as well as lazy, incompetent, gossiping people. Oh and if someone sexually harasses you forget about getting that resolved too. Somehow the union looks past multiple allegations."
good,Handling custom clearnace documents and lialise with customer regarding the duty and sales tax charges .Preapring paper works and documents for custom clearance purposed .
good,there no GOOD boss at UPS. None of them been there for longer then 2 years however your co-workers will help you enjoy your stay and get through it all
good,Just get to work on time and be the best you can be and do what you think will help the company in the long run be someone consistent and efficient to the best of your abilities
good,getting along with others in an small environment. talking with super vision people. a lot of different race their .I would say the hardest part of the job is jumping in and out of the truck or finding the proper house to the box like address. I love this job
good,i learn how work together has team and i enjoy culture and boss always treat us with plaza every friday if we meet the standard and he never break any promise man of his word i am thankful for time i was in in UPS i gain alot of knowledge from that.
good,"Manageable Hours , weekly pays  health insurance need more employees that comes to work on time and everyday needs to do better by keeping the building clean"
good,"I worked for UPS for almost 4 months in Ottawa. It was a good experience. that was my first job in Canada. the drivers are polite and humanitarian. UPS is a good company. The driver's salary starts at 14$. And after a few years, it may hit 33$, which is a good thing."
good,"Working in Ups was a good part-time job but, it was a challenging environment but, it also helped you learn how to think and pursue a risk for a reward plan everyday as a manager."
good,It is great way to start in the logistics field. great benfits and very family friendly. really wants to see you progress and become better. boss cares about employess
good,"Diverse culture, temperature inside the facility depending on the weather "
good,Ups would be a great place to work if the company valued and appreciated their employees more.  Employees ate being over worked and not receiving the pay to match the work.
good,"The workplace environment was brutal because I applied for the overnight shift. Other than the brutal night shift, the job was very competitive as you made friends with your coworkers with the same job."
good,"The work environment has a significant effect on employee motivation, job satisfaction and team morale. Employees are enthusiastic about reporting to work every day if the work environment is a positive one. The work environment includes a company’s location, facilities, culture, interactions between employees and employers, and growth opportunities, to name but a few."
good,"I was only hired as a seasonal employee, the check i receive was in no way meant to cover living expenses. It is hard work but good for a little extra money around christmas time."
good,Very stressful job as a driver. Everyday we have time limits on packages that we have to deliver. the new England weather is constantly changing and UPS works through it all.
good,I enjoyed working there it’s not enough staff good people not enough hours. Need more money! No room for growth! Overturn is really bad! People quit often
good,Need more full time opportunity. Flexible schedule. Shift options. Great management. Diverse. Warm during winter. Great communication great employees.
good,"I learned to work well as a team because its a really fats paced job and most of the boxes be very heavy."
good,"Job security"
good,we come to work in boots and a long sleeve determining whether the warehouse was cold or hot. we lifted packages up to 130 pounds. everything from taking packages out the truck to putting them on assembly lines was fast paced.
good,"Fast paced but fun.If you worked when they called you,you were first priority to get a steady schedule.It was fun being out and about in the community."
good,"Productive, UPS is a nice job Only was part time and always focused on my job task but I personally didn’t like the pay for the work that was required or being asked"
good,I was only a seasonal hire so I didn’t experiment the full benifits ups could have provided but for the time I was working there it was pretty good . The hours arnt bad but the pay for seasonal isn’t good for the hours you work at all but over all it’s a really good job with amazing benifits.
good,Not a bad place to work.  Pay could be better.  Everyone says it is a great place to work but you have to stick with it and be patient.  It also depends on your location.  Where I'm at the communication is terrible and I have been misled on many items.  I'm mainly there just for the tuition reimbursement and benefits.  I don't plan to make a career of it.  My co-workers are great to work with however.
good,ITS a good job if you are trying to make a career out of it but other then that i wouldn't recommend it. The hours are terrible unless your higher up.
good,This job isnt for everyon. You have to have a strong mind set to want to stay there. The pay starts of bogus but the raises are awesome so in order to see a nice check youd have to be there for quite some time
good,"Delivered an exceptional level of service to each customer in person and on the telephone calls by listening to concerns and answering questions.Schedule drivers to pick up and deliver loads to customers or vendors.  I was responsible for keeping records, monitoring driver daily logs for errors or violations and monitoring drivers' working hours.  knowing the weather of all your drivers locations in order to flag potential issues.  Scheduled and canceled appointments for arrival times and destinations.  To ensure that the truck drivers have the cargo to carry and stick to their appointed arrival times and destinations."
good,"working at ups was good for me because i an a fast learner. my good memory allowed me to learn how to sort the packages fast, and also hepled me find fore efficient was to do my job"
good,the company is a great place for high school student that just finished school and need a job for the summer or while they go to college. It is a great first job for someone to just get work experience
good,I honestly think the job was a great job to have if your more of a fast paced type of person and if you have great memory. Having the job is really worth it and meeting new people and getting advice is really helpful from the people that has been their for a good while.
good,"The work was stressful, and fast paced. The hours were difficult to balance with other daily activities. The work left you extremely tired throughout the day and required you to adopt to an extreme sleep schedule, but the ability to gain medical benefits makes it a favorable choice of employment."
good,I think The UPS Store is a great place to work. I was however looking to use skills to get involved in the sports industry. I became manager and learned how to run a store without any major assistance.
good,It was very strenuous job but I learned and achieved a lot over the two years that I was employed their. It was also very beneficial that they offered tuition assistance.
good,Expect to stand for 4-6 hours straight with only 1 ten minute break that they'll hold out on giving you for long as legally possible. Overtime is mandatory if needed. Management cares more about hitting numbers and production than their employees well being.
good,"It’s a good company to work for and the benefits are awesome. The hours I worked were crazy (2 am - 9 am). Overall a fun job.  The training could be a little better, maybe more hands on before your left to do it yourself."
good,"good environment "
good,"My schedule is from Sunday through Thursday, my shift is noonday. We go in everyday stretching and communicating on how the day will be. We work at a fast pace and sometimes gets dusty in trailers, but we have company to talk with while working."
good,You start your day in a trailer and end it in a trailer. You do grunt work if you have the lowest seniority and if you have the highest you're treated amazingly.
good,Fast pacing working fireman in a warehouse unloading trucks or loading.  Very  heavy lifting at times. It's a work out in there. Very tough job. They need to give more hours
good,A typical day at the ups facility required a lot of energy. The environment is very fast paced and can be stressful at times. I enjoyed working at the ups facility because I was able to get in a good workout daily. The toughest part about working the ups facility was having to adjust to the weather. In the warehouse there was little heating and cooling so the temperatures outside had a heavy influence on the inside while working.
good,"good people and great workers fast pace job, never stop moving, you always doing something if you not doing something than you miss something. You have to keep the fast pace going and not slow down. too much pressure."
good,UPS was a temporary position that only last from November to January then after January they would cut hours and decide if they wanna peruse with the employees or laid them off
good,Learned from people from different cultural background. Multiple areas to work in and guaranteed job growth once employee puts in his or her best. I have learned how to use UPS soft wears such as DMS tools.
good,"Great benefits and retirement. The pay could be a little better but that depends on what city you’re living in since there is cost of living adjustment; employees are paid the same regardless of city/state. "
good,"Great company to work with if you can deal with packages coming quick and stacking up quick. The pace is fast, packages come in all different weights, sizes, shapes. If one wanted to work here. Prepare for mental and physical workout."
good,"It’s a cool a job for it to be a temporary job , it’s a nice work out too . I liked the work it was just it took like long to actually get in to the UPS."
good,Working for ups was very fun I learned a lot working there. I learned how to load and unload trucks how go use a. Conveyor belt. I met different types of people and got connected more with people.
good,The job isn't for everyone its a lot of quick movements and lifting. Definitely want to eat and sleep well if working here. They do provide paid training before sending you out.
good,"very fast paced, no aircondition it gets HOT in there over the summer. management would be rude alot. over worked everyone during peak season. too much work for little pay."
good,UPS is a fast paced work environment. Their is alot happening at once and to achieve a successful day their you have to work your hardest. This means always being on top of your duties.
good,It was very fast paced job that you had you standing on your feet most of the time. It was a energetic job that helped you stay in shape but you would have to have a good work ethic
good,the job is ok great benefits but over all I would chose any job over UPS because they will get rid of you and never look back the work is very hard and strenuous on the body for long term health
good,"Ups package handler position is definitely a rough one, If you work hard and have a good attitude you will be promoted. There are a lot of co workers around you. I advise you to just work and don't horse around."
good,"If you're just looking for simple, hardworking, heavy lifting part-time job, this is a great place to work. Helped me gain strength in my upper body. Increases heart rate well. People are very nice. The difficult challenge is you have to wait a full year until benefits kick in, and vacation paid time off only happens after you have enough seniority at that local building. If you plan to have a busy personal life, with much travel, this job will be challenging at the beginning knowing their requirements."
good,Ups is cool to work at as a package if u like overnight jobs nevertheless loading up to four trucks at one time gives me a challenge and I also got a thrill out of it
good,"Depending on the day are start time is at 8 pm or 9 pm. Start time means the time we are suppose to clock in and start our shift. Once we start everybody goes to there station where they were assigned. i loved my management team because they was always hands if we needed help. The hardest part is being in a truck, loading the boxes by yourself, an they are flying off the shoot for us to load.The best part about ups is meeting new people in the process of doing new things."
good,A typical day will consist of packages flowing heavily down your shoot. Fact paced enivronment. How ever the weather is outside is the same way it will be in your trailer.
good,"You’re constantly moving, thinking, and problem solving. This job gets stressful, but it gets slightly better with time I would imagine. The hours range from rough to brutal, with some shifts starting at 3 or 4 AM. However, this is a great job, with great benefits, that can end up paying extremely well if you put the time in. "
good,"I was responsible for the same day-to-day tasks of answering the phone, mail distribution, and computer data updating.  Management was good and workplace was sufficient."
good,"Working for UPS is a job where if you want to get your feet wet and get some experience on your resume. I don't see myself working for UPS long. However, UPS is a great place to work, the culture is decent and the most of the people you work with are very friendly. If you would like to sit at a desk all day, this job is for you. Nothing is hard to do, I can't say anything that I have done over the past years has been challenging. I mean is a shipping company that is the main focus, making sure everything that comes in goes right back out on time."
good,"It's a great company, and there is plenty of room for advancement, if you can make it through the beginning phase, though. They will throw you right out to the floor, and move you around constantly, sometimes over-stressing you, as you have boxes continuously piling up if you're even a second behind."
good,"Working for UPS was wonderful, loved every second,minute every hour. the management team is a different story I was a unloader on a truck I also worked in different areas of the job"
good,A very fast-paced job. A great place to work for staying in good physical shape. I believe the pay salary should be more. Great benefits and great work experience.
good,UPS was a seasonal position for myself but once i got on the team i new it was a good fit. I continued my work and made great friends in the process. UPS was an exciting environment.
good,Driver helper was seasonal as for helping drivers deliver their packages safely and on time and shipping and receiving take them to their designated spot of a responsibility to be taken care .
good,"the import hours are great 3.5 hours in the middle of the night you do not miss anything. the people are majority sound, if you want to talk you can if you don't no ones really bothered. rules are not too strict and the pay makes it all worth while. Management is abit rubbish when it comes to the busy night as they have the 'hurry up and get it done' attitude when its pretty much impossible to move forward in some situations."
good,"Be on time, take your job serious . Help your next man or woman. Ups is a great place to be, it's alot to handle. Keep focus , do your job, and you'll go home safely"
good,You are required to get to work on time.always make sure that your work area is clean never lift a over 70  package by yourself always ask for help if you need help.
good,"3am-9am shifts i learned alot it was my first job quick pace"
good,one the physical laborous jobs i've had. A typical day at work is going in the truck and unloading packages weighing from 10 - 70lbs. Sometimes even more.
good,"If you can handle the sleep schedule, it's fantastic. And if you can handle the physical aspects of the job, as well as the occasional feeling of being overwhelmed, it'll do you right if you stick with it. Just get a side gig to supplement your income when you're starting out."
good,"Daily work is very challenging and will require you to move quickly and efficiently. However, UPS appears to be very short staffed so management is having its employs work more than usual and it can be overwhelming. You will be working hard and you will be sweating a lot in the loading/unloading stations. It is hard work, but doable."
good,UPS is really fun it's a great vibe an just makes you stronger mentally an physically. The pay is not that much starting off but once you've been there for a long period of Time you get to see your money that's worth you working
good,"Decent company to work for with friendly and understanding management, though we were often understaffed because coworkers would sometimes just not come in to work with little-to-no repercussions. "
good,Working at ups is ok for me I like it but I wish they just give more hours everything In there is really part time with little hours great company though nice managers just not enough hours that’s all
good,It was a great job. During pick it season it had great hours but after it was over. I always working and there on time but the supervisors were lookimg out for other people instead of the hard workers.
good,A good seasonal job. Pays well. The management works well with scheduling around school. Driver calls and asks if you can show up that day. Overall not a bad job.
good,"hard labor , not enough time for breaks  other than that the job was pretty cool. it was a different experience and a new opportunity to try.   every day they gaveyou saftey bucks to help you stay as safe as possible and you can win gloves and sweaters and ect."
good,Good workplace and decent opportunities to move up if you do a couple years in different departments which i wasn't completely convinced with cause apparently college doesn't even matter if you wanna move up faster where i'm from
good,"Working at UPS taught me that I do not want to work in the labor field.  That's a job for someone who has been doing labor work for a long time.  That was my first job, and it was very stressful.  Working in the extreme heat and the freezing cold weather.  I was loading and unloading packages for hours with very little break time.  But one thing I did learn from working there was it was always an opportunity to move up in the company after a while.  But I was still in High School and needed to focus on my senior year and prepare to go to college.  I am not a quitter, I just needed to get my priorities in perspective."
good,ups is a great job when i was there i had a good time working my job do everything they ask me to in if i didn't some one will come over show me how in i just like that place so much as my first job
good,Great Union. Will always have work will never cut you out of your weekly hours. Get paid every week on time. Takes a while but can advance to other positions
good,United Parcel Service or UPS is a worldwide recognized company with great benefits and long-term pay.  This company were the originators of the phrase ''hard work pays off.''
good,Nothing bad I can say pretty well rounded company and great supervisors. Ups is a good company a little loud but it's a good company and it's very diverse
good,"Safety is your friend. Stretch before you begin to work. Hard workers will be noticed and rewarded. This is a young persons game. As far as part time jobs go, this is a good start. No experience needed."
good,I loved working for this company. The people there has kept me going. Made me show up to work ready and energetic. The benefits was great and the help
good,"Το κομμάτι της του Operation Department είναι σχετικά θέμα ρουτίνας και αν έχεις καλη συνεργασία με την ομάδα σου και τον team leader σας τότε γίνετε και αρκετά εύκολο. Στο πόστο που υπήρξα, βάσικη γνώση είναι η ομαδικότητα και η αυτοσυγκέντρωση σε μία σειρά συγκεκριμένων διαδικασιών."
good,UPS is a great company and care about your safety a lot. Although the warehouse jobs are hard and tiring which requires a lot of work.
good,Everything is extremely easy you just have to stay focus and keep precaution at all times so you won't get hit with packages but that rarely happens. Then you have to work at high pace so you can get as many trucks possible unloaded. But its perfectly fine working at what ever rate you put your self to task at because safety is the number one rule. Also all co-workers are friendly
good,I see why UPS has the best insurance in the business. You'll probably need it sooner than later especially working inside the hub. But the work like balance is absolutely amazing.
good,"Overall you have to be physically prepared to work constantly with heavy objects, up to 200 pounds; lifting, moving, relocating. There was no air conditioner, so at summer the temperature inside of the trucks would be up to 105 degrees, while you are working."
good,I like ups so far great learning process. I learn almost eavery thing you need to know as a loader. My coworkers are great people and nice to be around them. The hardest part if the job is making sure not to brake your back. The enjoyable part is being arond those people.
good,Nice place to work very great benefits lots of great faces an fun people who help you pass the time its pro active new stuff every day there are great chances to advance in this company
good,"If you're waiting for a delivery that is anywhere near the window that UPS provides, you are going to be sadly disappointed. They do not adhere to that window in any respect whatsoever. It is my experience that they deliver their packages when they see fit. Mostly as late as an hour and a half from the last time it was suppose to be delivered. Do not use UPS under any circumstances if you need the package delivered on time."
good,"It's a truly physical job. If you don't like sweating or physical labor, don't apply to UPS. I didn't like the getting up at 3 am constantly everyday."
good,Great staff. Manangment works as a team.... Very willing to help any level all the time. Great training and notification of things that are changing or that we need to  be aware of.
good,Fun fast pace job keep me moving active and on keep my toes.this job showed me proper lifting skills and how to stack and sort packages in da proper manner according to mailing addresses.
good,It's get cold but it's going to be okay jus got to get us to it but they job is cool if u still in school and trying to pay bills and help out ur parents but it a good job
good,A typical day included loading and unloading baggage and cargo into airplanes. The working conditions are harsh during the winter times however time passes quickly when working part time.
good,"If you are young and fit this is the job for you, but for short term not long term. This job is not something you would like as long term since it is heavy and dirty and will face health issues on the long term."
good,"I love working 3rd shift. I'm a night owl. This place is good for people that don't need a whole lot of money or hours. I need it though. Its not somewhere I could spend the rest of my life at. I've met tons of great people, good friends, and my supervisor is an awesome guy. I love that I've moved on up really fast and became ""cerc"" which is someone who meets and trains with the new hires. I love talking to new people."
good,"learn how to operate different types of machines"
good,I like this job because you have to have speed to work here or it wont work out. I love working as a team or in this case a belt. I loved the pay rate but didn't give out enough hours.
good,"I definitely wasn't prepare for this.  This job is backbreaking, dangerous and fast-paced. I understand why package handlers only get 5 hours a day. No way any person can work 8-10 hours a day for this position. If you're not fast, those packages will bury you. You have to load up to 800-1500 packages a night (they track your Pk uploads). And boy, they will hassle you for not doing so. But the worst thing you can do at this job is MISLOAD. Do not misload. You will get re-training, a write-up, and possibly fired if it happens twice or a third time. But luckily, this company has a union, so you can challenge it....that's only IF you worked for more than 30 days. Uploading the truck is the easiest part of the job, unloading truck is the hardest....because you only have 30 minutes to unload big semi trucks. Overall, a very organized company...but definitely not for everyone. What I learned from working at UPS?....stay in school. Physical labor just isn't for me."
good,"A ordinary day of work for me is unloading multiple trailers within a three to four span with a ten minute break."
good,I would go meet the driver at our location to start work I would separate packages by address for easier delivery then walk off the work truck to safely deliver packages
good,i liked the work at ups.. it had a good pay system and good health benefits.  it was very fast paced so the shift went quick and because of that i was able to stay in shape
good,"Typical day: long"
good,"I had a very important position at The UPS Store. My duties were to create custom designs, business cards, logos, greeting cards, signs, advertisements, and invitations. During my work shift, not only did I have to complete print jobs, I also had to work the front service counter and use knowledge of company services, pricing and options to customers. They had top-of-the-line commercial printing machines to complete large custom print jobs with several different materials in various sizes. Although the job was great, I was promised a raise after a ninety day period and never received the raise. I went through the process of completing multiple, company tests and was never granted the promised raise. I stayed at The UPS Store for nearly nine months until I started working at the American Press as a page designer."
good,ups is a okay place to work but its hard work and it takes a lot of energy out of you. the management can sometimes be rude but not all of them. the so-worker are cool people to be around. the hardest part is trying to build a perfect wall when the bells constantly keeps going off.
good,"It was fairly easy for the most part. Cold during winters and Hot during summers. Big warehouse to walk around in, definitely able to get a good workout from walking haha."
good,"UPS packing centers are fast paced and can be stressful, but good management and helpful co-workers make it a somewhat easy transition."
good,Unload and load trucks. Drive delivery parcels. Fast paced company. Sort and bag parcels to the location they are destine for.
good,"-Usually would come in cleaned the dining hall and prep food, then collect dishes and clean afterward."
good,"The managment needs a lot of improvement. They dont have a safe work environment and theres a lot of inequity, favoritism, and coersion. The pay, flexibility and benefits are the best thing they have but it doesnt compensate for the lack of leadership skills."
good,Enjoyed working here. The only setback was that it is hard to get full time and they don't pay well enough for the work you do as a supervisor.
good,"Typical day at work for me is unloading and loading airplanes."
good,"I loved my job , but it was a temp work.I learned that a job can be fun, when you get it right"
good,"This was a great job while I was in College. It was hard and fast work. I worked with another guy to fill the most dense truck on the outbound. I learned teamwork and quality control. Management was weak because they were afraid to tell employees what needed to be done, it was very political and I did not like that if the Loaders complained about the supervisor he could be fried pretty easy because the loaders were union and the supervisors were not. I still believe that UPS would have been better ran if they stood behind there mangers more and gave them more authority. I liked that UPS helped pay for school through a school program and received a gas card once a month for going to school."
good,I was a sorter which was one of the harder jobs in ups ground but they offered a lot of benefits and also paid for my schooling as long as I kept a C avaerage
good,I learned how to lift properly and lower. I get along with management and co-workers.
good,very fast pace working environment..kind of a hard job.. I enjoyed the most part about ups and the benefits were great
good,"A typical day of work is getting set up in your work area, packages coming done like crazy and getting everything cleaned up before the end. "
good,"Liked working here, just didn't offer the hours needed, worked at night, loaded and unloaded trucks, using forklifts, hand trucks, etc."
good,Typical day will be unloading trucks and loading trucks.  I learned what you put into a job is what u accomplished and achieve in your life. Co-workers was outstanding. No hard part and the enjoyable part was learning to unload and load within a reasonable time.
good,Hard Work. Sometimes you have to pick up for other people who don't pull their weight. 
good,"my days at this job consisted of friendly customer service and pleasing young kids. I learned that there's many ways to make kids happy and that their are sooo many different toys / activities for kids. my cowokers were all friendly and helpful and I loved working as a team. the hardest part of my job I say would have to have been black Friday , being how they were so so busy but I loved it! the most enjoyable part of the job was making kids happy and seeing a smile on their faces"
good,I had to climb up a 30ft ladder everyday to work. I learned how important it was to get customers their packages in a timely manner.
good,There is job security. Its at a part-time bases. Only Upper management is Full-time. No holiday pay for management. Over-time is at 40 hours from at 27.30 hour part-time salary pay. 
good,"open the shop, check for any write ups on equipment that needs to be repaired ASAP. do repairs, check computer for schedule equipment maintance, check fuel log and enter into the computer, reordor parts, do maintance and clean shop."
good,"the job hours are very short until peak not a fulltime job, most people use this job to supplement income or for benefits"
good,"A typical day includes loading 3-4 package cars and lifting a total of 2,500 pounds a day. Learning how logistics work and a general knowledge of the UPS delivery process was a great experience. It is a fast paste job but the co-workers are good people and make it enjoyable."
good,I unoaded semi trucks at an average rate of 1600 per hour. It was hard work. Great benefits.
good,My typical day is bagging and sometimes sorting. I learned to think before you speak because everyone is totally different. Management well I'm an early type of person or on time. My job is not that hard the most enjoyable part is sometimes joking around with the employees even though we get along or don't. Treatment of the employees is fair.
good,A typical day is consist of a lot of multi-tasking and time management. Management and staffing help to get assingments done on time. Co-workers are a great resource for help and. The hardest part of work is having enough staffing. The most enjoyable part of the job is on occasion having a little down time with my staff.
good,overall work place could be better the short breaks and little hours are my main concern everthing else is good
good,A typical day at ups was coming getting ready for the shift such as preparing our self for that night/morning the thing i learned at ups was how too work at a fast paced.the management was ok.my co-workers was helpful when they was able to everyone.the hardest part of the job was working in the warehouse around the dust and dry heat.the only enjoyable working at ups was working around different people.
good,I worked here seasonally from 11pm-3:30am. A lot of hard work(physical labor) went into this job. Nothing really bad to say other then that. Good for part time/night work
good,"Working for UPS was well it was working for UPS. Hardwork, lots of volume and your always on the go."
good,environment was good fun people to b around and just a good atomosphere
good,It's a stressful job that's worth it all.I learned that warehouse's are not to be taken lightly it's a very tedious job.
good,"Work at UPS was great pay, benefits and etc. But very intense work pace this job is more of a solo job spending most of ur time in a truck alone loading package to the correct truck."
good,Great experience with great people. Hard work that pays off
good,UPS offers a great benefits and offer growth opportunities.
good,Always made sure their employees took their daily two 15 minute breaks. Friendly; people oriented enviroment
good,UPS is exactly like high school sometimes it has a lot of drama and people always in your business but other than that I enjoy working at UPS and getting the packages out on time so they can be delivered.
good,"A good job if you want something physical. "
good,"Hurries injuries"
good,I love working with ups because it had good benefits and people were very nice however they barely give help when needed they only care when you showing up to work
good,Work was easy and the supervisors and managers really cared to make sure the work was getting done but safely. They trained and helped out as much as they could.
good,"You can find some definite Job security with UPS, however don't expect to get payed very much. Actually, they will most definitely work you harder than they will you pay. They will usually tell you this during the interview process."
good,"Each company has good and bad. Management could definitely improve their process and organizational skills. Communication could improve, but the pay is definitely good enough to deal we with it."
good,At UPS sorting packages into certain trucks was a primary job I had there as well as unloading several trailers. My shift began around 2-4 AM and ended at around 10:30.
good,When i first started working there it was okay until i had to work out of a golf cart in 20 below weather in the rain with was not good on me or my partner during the time they also really didn't care at the fact that i was working out of a golf cart and the packages was also getting wet and a lot of those was tv's which i felt bad but they didn't care.
good,"very labor demanding but not enough pay,  workplace was very organized and managment was extremely helpful, respectful and productive.              aj"
good,"UPS isn’t a horrible job, but if you want a check every week or a start up job this is the perfect one for you. It’s not easy at all and the conditions aren’t the best but it can be good because of coworkers and how busy you stay."
good,"average workday includes what you would expect, lots of boxes. I definitely learned a lot more proper ways of lifting heavy items and keeping my work organized. management is okay they make sure you keep up with everyone else and maintain your work. the hardest part would just be the work in general, if you don't want to do a lot of physical work dont work here. the best part would probably be the overtime."
good,It was a very physically challenging job. It was also very repetitive and hot in the summer. You also have to work part time and for minimum wage for many years to be a driver.
good,Great place to work as a college student hours were flexible and pay was decent. Also the job was not difficult and manager was ok with allowing employees to do home work when the store was not busy.
good,As a part-time job you cannot do better.  More than 80% of Management and drivers started as part time package handlers.  Part time workers have a pension plan after 5 vested years (though a small pension).  But I don't know any other part time jobs that have a pension plan of any kind.  Part-time workers have full-time benefits unfortunately it takes about a year to get them.
good,I learned how to handle more than 1 task and how to work on a fast pace. The hardest part of the job is when the air belts are backed up and all the packages are all over the place
good,It was a relaxed work environment until the line started up then it’s a very fast pace and you get a little stressed out at times but over-all it will always start you out at part-time then you have the chance to advance into the company which is a great company for benifits/dental and all I’m not positive about holidays being paid for or not but I heard they have a good vacation setup
good,Ups is one of the better company's i have worked for because unlike my first job they really care about the wellness of their workers. ups make work less stressful and more enjoyable.
good,"On a typical day at work it was always everyone do different task to get the job done, moving at a faster paste in order to make sure our customers where happy and that they got there packages in time and in great condition. I learned that it is important that when your working a job that involves dealing with customers and their belongings make sure your treating those items as if there your own and that your always thinking about what if this was your own things or someone you know. Management was okay but there were a lot of issues with my checks and i feel like they didn't take that serious. The workplace was awesome a lot of friendly people and the job was great itself. For me there was no hardest part to the job it was pretty simple and easy to to understand the task and get in done on time. The most enjoyable part for me being a unloader was getting those trucks doen especially when i got more comfortable with the task because i was able to knock out like 3 loaded trucks in a hour."
good,There are a lot of cool people that work here but some of them have some serious problems they need to work through specifically anger management. Also HR could do a much better job doing the job of being in HR
good,Would never work for uos again never got a raise i never received any benefits the salary pay for ups part timers was horrible hardly got any hours plus they were cutting hours
good,"• Fast paced "
good,"I actually really enjoyed working at UPS during peak season. It was fast paced and we got plenty of hours and ridiculous overtime. If we worked more than 5 hours in a day we got time and a half over time, 6 days time and a half, and day 7 was double time. I liked all of my part time and full time supervisors. They were very understanding and personable at any time. Since peak season has ended, I am barely pulling 3 hours a day. It sucks because I enjoy my job, but I can't make enough money!"
good,"It's a really tough job. I load 4 trucks on a daily basis. Check for leaking packages, test the weight to prevent damage. "
good,"As a package handler for a year I noticed there where a lot of disorganization not only from other employees but the managers as well. The hours where decent but only good for a month or two during ""peak season""."
good,"Great culture working there, management is beyond good to employees. Productive environment. "
good,"Excellent job if you want to make lots of money after 4 years.   However,  work life balance is very difficult, because your shift will start from 9am till finished which could be as late as 9pm.   At first you will be a swing driver covering for absencees and drivers gone on holidays.  This can be overwhelming, but if your patients you will learn all the routes until you get your own route which is only available if a full time driver resigns or a new one is posted or made up."
good,"it was a nice work place , a couple of dislikes but nothing to hate . you work with and meet a lot of new people . it’s a fast working job. cold in the winter and crazy hot in the summer but they’re nice management."
good,ups is a great company to work for you get benefits and a 401k but if you don't like getting up early in the morning moving a lot of packages or starting out at 11$ an hour for all the wok you are doing this not for you. once u move up its a better job more money and more opportunity for you but being at the bottom as a loader is terrible over all the job is ok depends on if u can take the work load.
good,"really hot in summers, little hours the good thing is the benefits kick in they are really good but it all depends on you. If you are going in as a part time you will need a second job"
good,A reasonable place to work if you don’t mind hard work.  Very organized and work is plentiful.  The opportunity for advancement is there though it is difficult in the ways of networking amongst peers and superiors.
good,"UPS has been one of my favorite places to work at by far. I have so many memories at UPS I could cry, however the pay rate for the hours received is sickly. You can never have enough money to even fix your car, go out to grab a bite to eat, pay rent. Life was very hard outside of work but while your there it was such a fun experience!"
good,I learned a lot from others & would consider returning should it present itself. I would share my experience & tell others about United Parcel Services.
good,i couldnt take the working only 3 or 4 hours a day and having $150-$200 checks i needed something more my speed and being in trailers all day by myself wasnt for me .but overall the do have good benefits
good,"I love working to assist the driver on my shift . it was a fun job for me, but was told in advancement jobs were to be offered after the seasonal I was placed in and that promise was not followed through with ,  I was severely disappointed"
good,"I worked here one month short of two years and only received ,30 cents raise. Good benefits but can't support myself here. Typical day id 3.5 hours and starts at 5 pm, which took me an hour in 5 o' lock rush hour traffic!"
good,"I began as a package handler ( a loader to be more specific).  The job is very fast paced and requires a lot of lifting.  Many people do not last since it is a lot of labor.  However, there are many opportunities within the company.  I decided to follow the management path and got promoted to part-time supervisor.  As a supervisor, you have to make quick decisions and know how to move your people.  The benefits of the company are great.  I enjoyed most that the people in the job were around my age for the most part.  Many employees are college students trying to take advantage of the tuition assistance program.  The hardest part of the job is getting your people to move at a very fast pace."
good,this was just a temporary job for me. i actually LOVED working here. got a work out while getting paid.  had the salary been more competitive i would have considered making a career out of it.
good,"I was a package sorter, and we had our own section and, you could do it at your own pace. If there was a box or package that you werent able to carry, your cowowrkers or supervisors were always there to help you out."
good,The daily night out on the ramp was relaxed unless it was peak season. Loading the planes was fun if your crew was all close and knew how to cut up and pass time. I also had cool supervisors that were laid back on policies also so it made it smooth going. its easy to load and operate the equipment if you do so as trained.
good,A typical day at work is just going in the factory and getting to work you get assigned to something as soon as you get there. I didn't really learn much but it gave me a decent experience for my first job.
good,Productive place to work.  Working outside on the ramps have to know how to load packages into designated ares. Be able to drive equipment and unload / load shipping containers in aircraft. Top side just unloading/ loading shipping containers. For the bellies of aircraft you unload/load packages from shipping containers into or out of the aircraft and out or into the shipping containers. As for  working outside be prepard everynight for any type weather. Work well with others on your crew.
good,"I enjoyed the people i worked with even most of the higher ups. Work was fast paced which helped the day fly by. It was labor intensive, but i enjoyed it because at the end of the day it was like working out."
good,Working at UPS was a great part time gig because the benefits was great and the days went by fast because its constant work. I worked the graveyard shift and the hours where great because it leaves enough room for you to work 2 jobs if needed
good,i enjoyed working for ups it was hard physical work but i was working with good people do to it being a union job there was room to grow but i couldnt wait any longer for full time and had at least 5 more years
good,"A typical day at UPS would be us getting 40,000 packages every night. We would ship all types of things to deliver like furniture, perfumes, and insects. The hardest part about  the job is the weight of the things that are being shipped. The best part about this job is the people that you work with."
good,I think it was ok. It was overwhelming at times and stressful. But it is a reliable job. I got paid every week. And worked with a great set of people that helped.
good,The company pays okay for the amount of hours. They offer really good benefits. The overnight shift is difficult to adjust to. It was a really good work out. The job is very physical.
good,Great place to get some extra money on the side with great benefits to all employees. UPS also allows plenty of flaexabilty in your work schedual for person matters.
good,"Compensation was good, but it is a very cut throat business and it really depends on who your manager is.  It is very fast paced, and most time you work with a team, so that is good"
good,"3-4 hour shifts"
good,Gives you a chance to grow in more than just one field has great health benefit needs more fulltime or overtime in the year other than that its great.
good,Very good job just conflicted with my schedule. Job has very good benefits if you stick with them for long term. Takes awhile to move up the rankings to become a driver but overall its worth it
good,I would work very hard everyday at work loading the trucks .  I also work on the sorting packing. Management is very poor. I enjoy working there part time and because its fast paced.
good,"The company is great to work for. Full-time managers are a mix of laid-back and micromanaging. If you can make work your #1 priority, UPS is the place for you."
good,"Maintained detail cleaning and sanitization throughout the facility"
good,It was a nice place to work  . It was seasonal I enjoyed every experience while being there .  Loading and unloading trucks was one of many jobs I learned while working there
good,"Overall, good workplace for a fast paced worker. Helps the day go by smooth when you constantly have a task to finish. Very straight forward on job duties and what needs to be completed every day."
good,"UPS is great for people going through school as two big keys in life are Insurance and School tuition. UPS payed for both, all the people that worked there were your own age so connecting with people was quick and easy. There were a lot of extra curricular activity's available as well."
good,"- There is a lot to do with the PSO system, mail box manager, CMS etc. We also had to make sure to help our customer and type up the information in the system"
good,"I enjoy working with ups. However, I work night shift and I'm looking for something first shift. I've worked with ups for almost three years now. If I work first shift I wouldn't be searching for another job."
good,Ups is a great part time job for me despite the hours I work bad it is very easy to receive promotions once completed seniority
good,You in and are assigned to a truck. You have to load your truck and keep it clean while assisting neighboring trucks. I learned how to work in a uncomfortable workplace with multiple tasks. Managers were easy to work with and very helpful. Coworkers were alright some more helpful than others. The hardest part of the job was keeping two truck clean at one time. The best part of the job was the ten minute break we received.
good,"bonne entreprise"
good,good work place there are positions for day or night whatever you prefer . there is a union here to so  advancing forward is ALL up to you
good,"Responded to customer inquiries or complaints."
good,"The job itself is physically demanding in a challenging environment. I work outside unloading airplanes and cargo. It is a third shift position and outdoors, which the biggest downfall. It can be unpredictable with the weather and this can be challenging. The job itself is a bit physical but never boring. I get to work on different types of equipment and responsibility. The company itself has excellent benefits and scholarship programs for all employees, even part-time."
good,A typical day is working at high rate. Staying busy is a requirement. Heavy lifting is required. Must pay attention to detail.
good,"Not to sure!!!!!"
good,ups is an enjoyable part time job. they have reasonable hours but the management needs some work. the management expect you to work extremely hard without letting you go to the restroom or getting water which i think is unacceptable but other than that its a good place if looking for part time work.
good,"Great Health benefits for part time employment. Company BBQs and annual charity and volunteer events. Co-Workers are great. Supervisors are amiable for time off, school and personal days. Need more full time positions available. Also more of a variety in the work eg. I have been multiple areas of the building but doing the same job. I can glance at a box and tell you where its going to go and about how long it will take it to get there."
good,In my opinion this is a hard and physically draining job but that is all in a days work. The only bad thing that I can say about this job is that the lack of hours for a package handler are unsatisfying.
good,I feel as though Ups is a good company to work for only if your looking to part time work. I also feel that I should get paid more for the amount of hard work and work that I do. My contributions to the company is well accepted but the compensations is very low.
good,"Night work"
good,"facilities in this location is not acceptable the mensroom is far from the job site about 3 minutes walk,during winter you have to wear jacket due to lack of heating."
good,Packing cell phones to be shipped out.  Making sure everything was with the phone before sent out.  Lead work - distributing cell phones to employees for programming.  Made 4800 boxes per day on box machine.  Packing and shipping enjoyed the most.
good,"great experience"
good,A typical day at work loading packages onto freight trucks. I learn that loading trucks requires a lot of stamina and  intense focus. The hardest part of the job is loading heavy hardware onto the trucks.
good,load and unload trucks and have them ready to leave in three and a half hours and make sure it's securely packaged.i learned how to handle hazardous packages and what to expect when shipping packages. everyone puts in extra work to make sure everyone finish on time. they try to make things fun and help when they are done with their jobs. with the weather changing conditions the trucks can get extremely hot or cold. each month of safe free injures they have a bbq.
good,I work for the ups facility in newark liberty international airport. The pay isn't good initially but they have grew health benefits for you and your family.
good,"The work environment at UPS is a great one.  I wasn't in the job for a great deal of money nor did I worry about the benefits.  I am in the army reserve, and I already have benefits."
good,This is a great job because you get in a days work starting at 430 Am which allows you the rest of the day to do what you want. The short comings of the job is that if you are new there you are constantly on call and dont get that much work. I was only making 100 per week because of short shifts.
good,"Lack of communication from upper management."
good,"I learned how to lead a team and be productive. The co workers are active and very willing to accomplish their goals. Hardest part of the job is motivating people."
good,"This is a great place for someone who just wants extra income. It's laid back and relaxed, as long as you can lift you the boxes."
good,"great place to work. i load trucks and unload trucks all day. great benifits, great group of people to be around."
good,"I come into work clock in, put on my scanner and being my job. The job is for me to load a truck with as many boxes as possible, keeping a loading pace of at least 300 boxes a hour."
good,depends on location buts it kind of like fed-ex and working at the post office fast paced too
good,great starter job. EXCELLENT BENEFITS AND THE JOB IS WHAT YOU MAKE OUT OF IT.
good,I was employed by UPS years ago as a package handler and during my initial training I was told that the only way you really go anywhere is by either getting hurt or knowing someone on the inside.
good,It’s an easy job. All you have to do is put boxes in a truck. Great place to work for good money during the holidays or as a driver. After the holidays the hours get cut dramatically.
good,It was ok my manager and I had our ups and downs but they always helped me out with fixing my mistake with my job and talked me through everything I needed to know about
good,"Great people, very fast paced, always had to show up READY to work, flexible hours, very good benefits as well, overall great work experience. I would definitely recommend this job"
good,It’s very stressful on your body mentally and physically. You have to be able to lift at least 70 pounds over your shoulders also you have to be able to place 23 packages per min on the conveyer belt
good,"I started as a temporary work working in the Security Department as a Night Value Associate. 6 months later, I was offered a position in the Human Resources Department. 3 months after that, I was hired on as a permanent employee; Part Time Security Supervior. I performed that job for a year and 5 months. I was prompted to Security Specialist. I performed the job for 3 years before I was laid off."
good,The trailers intensified the weather outside which made it difficult to work. There was not a single day that I would not hurt myself. The management was decent. I learned how to work under pressure and how to keep myself calm in the most dire situations.
good,The hardest part is how physical demanding it is.its not a bad job you would usually work 5 to 7 hours a day the down side is you have to work at 3 am sum time you have to go in earlier the  that
good,Have built skills and made friends with others.  They all help out . Have very nice benefits great insurance. Challenging and rewarding. Be a difficult job to leave.
good,I liked working at UPS it was a good job with great benefits. They just didn’t offer enough hours for me. After the first 2 weeks you get used to the lifting and time goes by fast.
good,It can be a much better place to work and they can do better with the hours u work a day as a part time work breaks can be a little bit long than what they have it set at
good,It was an available job when needed it so no complaints and everyone has been very understanding with what is going on currently in my life which is a good thing I needed random days off for it
good,"a typical day is very short the work that we do in 3 hours is actually the work that is suppose to be done in 5-6 hours, Also very over worked and under paid"
good,I love working at ups it has a lot fast pace and very fun to learn  new things. It is a good part time job if u want to go higher then apply for full time with in the company. Being a role model for other employees is what I do best I am a hard worker and never been late to work at all.
good,"The job is great, the people not so much. A lot if favoritism, unfair and some supervisors on power trips. Other than that it's pretty good. The hours are great, just when our department needs help we are out of luck,  then have too work tons of overtime to help other departments, that's unfair. Not everyone is treated equally, tons of favorites!"
good,"I like them, but they need to get the contract handled.  They do not pay enough, and they do not give enough hours.  It's unfortunate because the management are nice people, and the culture is a positive one."
good,Have to come ready to work every night & have to be willing to adjust to changing conditions within warehouse. Also have to get use to working with different people any given shift.
good,Got to stay ahead of the work a rookie is put into a trailer and is monitored on load quality and safety precautions. Cant fall behind or you’ll get buried in the trailer with packages.
good,"The on call aspect of the position is very tough to deal with. It's good for someone who is young and single but someone with a family will struggle with the scheduling and balancing your outside life. You will be a slave to your phone, also some days you wouldn't get a call. Overall if you last the company has a lot to offer and treat the drivers very well."
good,Very Fast Paced Job . You Really Have To Make Sure You Are Fit & In Shape For This Job . Be Able To Lift Heavyweights boxes & Dont Mind The Challenge.
good,"Ups is a long term company/ job. So if your looking to make big money right off the bat. Then this isn't the place for you. However, once you get hired, longer you stay. The benefits / overall placement will only get better. But it can be a high stress/ cut throat place to be. So it's not for everyone as I've come to learn. They hardly fire anyone, most of the time people tend to tend for various reasons. So again, you have job security with full time benefits working a s apart time worker. The hours make it flexible, for you to still have a family/ second job. But you learn rather quickly who you can & can't trust/ talk too, as with any company. It's a highly competitive place to be, often you get hired via someone putting in a good word for you. Took me almost four years to get in, I'm not leaving anytime soon. If you are someone who enjoys a fast pace/ moving around, working with your hands& enjoy a challenge. Then Ups is the place for you"
good,You have to be willing and able to work here. It can get stressful at times. They are really strict on attendance as all jobs should be but there you REALLY have to get there on time.
good,"- Writing manifests, tracking dry ice and closing containers. "
good,It is a hard working and its timing its decateded you have to work like you own it its a great experience its tiring you have to have great movement and great pace.
good,A good first job to have. There big on safety and team work also a lot of great people working there. A great cmpany to stay with and to work for at the end of the day.
good,it was fun the people were very exceptional and the benefits made it worth it all the more.... unfortunately the work hours were very long and tiring.
good,"I learned how to work fast and efficiently while being safe and organized. A typical day I was expected to load 400 boxes per hour."
good,It is a beginner position for those seeking a flexible part-time work schedule with full-time benefits. One can always move up into higher positions to become full-time.
good,Great place to work. Hard work and very fast logistic company great supervisors .extras as a full time but slow as a part time.all around great company to work for but full time
good,go to work inspect the areas. wait for phone calls or concerns to come in. then supervise guys until shift is over. great group of people to work with
good,"Love the night culture that comes with job"
good,"they are strick on safety and that makes it good for everyone.."
good,"Awesome co-workers and the union providers are great with job security. The benefits that are provided are very much worth staying on the job. When moving into the management area, it is no where near fair or secure."
good,"You start off being a part-time hourly employee working an average of 20-25 hours a week. As an hourly employee there are a variety of job roles most are unloading trailers and loading trailers. With unloading an inbound trailer, an employee would utilize extending belt that would retract and reached inside a trailer to unload the packages that would be transported to a sort isle where employees would sort out the packages according to zip-code. Conveyor belts would transport the packages to a destination for loading to outbound trailers or air-cans for airplanes. As an hourly, once you acquired enough seniority you can sign up to be a driver or have a choice to become a part-time supervisor. Drivers can be part-time or full-time. All hourly and drivers are protected by the Union. Management is not. As a part-time supervisor your job was to supervise hourly employees. A supervisor would have responsibility to a certain area. You would train and document your daily safety logs to ensure employees are working efficiently, correctly, and safely. Upward mobility in management is through discretion and once promoted from a part-time supervisor you become full-time supervisor and manager after that. this job is a fast paced, physically and mentally demanding job. Production and hours run the operation. Plus you have to deal with Union employees. Which is a good and bad thing. Good as in job security. Bad as in if you're a bad worker you will always have your job."
good,"A typical day at Ups is constant work until the day is over with. I learned that hard work and dedication will pay off. Management can be difficult to deal with at times, but overall its a nice place to build your career."
good,when i arrive at work i make sure have the material that i need to start my night. As the parcels come i put them in a bag and put it on the belt so the belt so the parcels can be loaded.
good,"Ups was a nice place to work, but this was not my dream job.  I would recommend it to those who don't see college in their future."
good,"the typical day at work was great, i been learned how to work in a team with my coworkers, the management were good they treat you like professional and explain the workers all the work. the co workers are people respectful and educated that if i got question they explain me how i could work. the hardest part of this job were that was a little far from my where i live. The most enjoyable part from this job were that i lile to work with costumers and meet people.."
good,"UPS is hard work, but its good for young people trying to go to school."
good,Great place to work. Love that place lots wok non-professional
good,Very nice place to work but they don't pay much compared to the market :(
good,"I love working early in the morning from 11am to 5am, the management was good they work with you if you need a day off. My co-workers were fun to be around, they made me laugh. I learned how to supervise/manage people, and I enjoyed everyday working for this company."
good,"U.P.S is a early morning get up b4 anyone else kinds of job. U have to be able to get straight to work, in a high productivity atmosphere."
good,"Very hard on your back and other body parts. Not being able to have help half of the times, and moving at the pace that the company wants you to with a very short quick fast break."
good,"Good enviroment nice people to work with,you have to be on a fast pace at all times."
good,A productive place every day at work always busy. However supervisors didnt really care about employees just cared about the numbers all the time.
good,excellent work experience and pay. part of a family. some management works with your life despite the long hour and hard work.
good,UPS was a interesting place to work. the hours are bad only because it was 2am-830am. my coworkers made it fun because we were all in the same age group and had a lot in common.
good,Ups has plenty of work opportunities. Flexibility with location and hours. Everyone is very friendly. It can also be a long term carrier if you would like it to be.
good,You get good hours during peak season then it kinda falls off the union benefits are worth it though after nine months it’s full health coverage and you can opt to pick up extra shifts
good,Nice job Environment to work in you meet a lot of different people with different the team workers are politel and nice they have a great benefits 💋💋
good,Been working for almost 2 years. Is Thought and fisical work but it depends on how you see it. I see it as a day of work out. They're nice people there willing to help out. The benefit are great for me an my family. I love working there.
good,"Union Job"
good,"I liked working for UPS> It was fast paced and challenging being a drivers helper.  If you are sensitive to extreme weather conditions...this is not the job for you. At the end of the seasonal run, if there are permanent jobs available, they hire one or two to stay on."
good,"filling the planes with freight and marshaling them out on a time schedule."
good,"come in and review emails/vm and get calling your customer that have not met their payment terms. We need a promise to pay commitment before account is put on credit hold."
good,"the pay is really not great but the benefits make up for it other than that this is an good work place. they have health insurance, dental plan, and 401k plan"
good,It was fun cause of the people that I worked with and my manager and easy money but it’s not enough to live off of ups is the type of job you do just because it pays for college that’s why most of the workers where there
good,My point of view on ups. 
good,lverall a great place to work. upper management is a dictatorial style . wasn't impressed with them .can be a stressful job if youre not accustomed to that kind of atmosphere. must work a a very high lvel of efficiany to be successful there
good,"always busy an running doing different things"
good,very productive hard labor nothing I can handle a straight forward company people friendly a lot of culture also educated more on my people skills a lot of oppurtunity
good,Good job but not for me. The work is tedious and boring but if you are just looking for work this is your place. If you stay with the company they will look out for you.
good,"As a package handler, you are required to either unload or load up 18-Wheeler  trailers for transportation the following morning. The work load is hard considering the hourly pay you get. Working conditions also aren't ideal considering there's no air-conditioning/heating working within a trailer whether it's summer time or winter time. UPS offers a lot of benefits and many career opportunities for those who see themselves working at UPS in the long run. Great company to work for and job security for those employee's who continually work to the best of their abilities."
good,UPS gives of great benefits and very hard workers. We made sure people got their packages on time and was very cautious. We worked as a team to make sure our customers were happy.
good,Worked on the airport making sure the palnes had the correct wieght before entering the plane. Dealt with cargo frieght
good,"I would come in clock in and wait for my supervisor to assign me to a trailer. id grab a scanner and a belt go to my trailer set up and start loading boxes. I learned how to move at a very very fast pace and how to multi task, i also learned how to lift boxes the appropriate way with out hurting myself. Management was pretty nice and understanding. My co-worker were a lot of help. the hardest part was not letting my trailer rack get backed up. the enjoyable part was it was a great stress reliever and work out."
good,it was very fun to work there during christmas and very fun to be around ups its a good compony to be involved they treat you like family and make you feel comfrotable
good,"-A day at my job starts with me getting there at 3am, i go get totes for my next day airs."
good,everything was good just very busy during holidays and evening time. the management was good helped out alot. the hardest part of the job was during the busy times at times.
good,"Work though the hard times. Get in all the programs they have. If you can. It's four shifts, try to go for day shift. It's the best shift I feel. Great future advancement."
good,If you like throwing stuff in trucks this is the job for you. Very fast paced. Sometimes you get free food. Supervisors are mostly cool people. All it all not a bad job if you are looking for a side gig.
good,i really enjoyed working with this company i loved my job it was very productive and fast paced. i enjoyed most of the people i worked with. the benefits are excellent i couldnt ask for better benefits
good,Being at UPS I Learned To Work Hard. Taught Me How To Stand Up As A Man Break Sweats And Do My Best To Get What I Want And To Be All I Can Be.
good,"Very fast pace, physically motivated, ready to handle whatever bussiness came our way. Worked as a team, loved and enjoyed it, Hardest part of the job was, being let go.I felt very comfotable with the supervisors and strived for the challenge."
good,Very under paid. Not enough hours only when it’s holiday season. Good management. Good work days. Really no complaints just don’t get paid enough for the work you do.
good,"Trabaje duro llenando 3 camiones como Loader. En 3 ocasiones firme las listas y no me consideraron para driver en ninguna ocasion. Sin embargo, empleados nuevos sin experiencia y sin estar el tiempo requerido como loader los subian a drivers en corto tiempo. Eso desmotiva y desmoraliza."
good,"As this was a seasonal job, it didnt offer benefits; however, the pay was decent but the hours were not great as they limited you to working a certain amount a day."
good,The benefits compensate for the low pay rate...and the only way u get benefits is if you're going to school and plan on working for them when you graduate...very hard work for the pay rate
good,"Ups is a Good place to work, and also pays well. The only thing I dont like about UPS is the amount of time they give you before letting you know when you will meet your driver."
good,"My thoughts about UPS. It was interesting, fun and a great experience. The people their were polite, social but most important active. I'd go back to UPS."
good,going into work first going to our supervisor meeting i learn how to deal with problems when the first come up management was nice and they were helpful my co workers were a team platheyer got the job done.
good,Good schedule to pair with daily activities.
good,"I clock in, wait to find out where I'll be assigned, go to my appointed place, and do my job until its time to go home."
good,The raises are a joke. The raise does not even cover the monthly increase in the Health insurance increase. No cost of living raise since early 2000. With the new healthcare plan provided for management most management and administrative staff are either not going to the doctor or applying for medical. I no longer recommend UPS to anyone as a place to become a supervisor. Go somewhere else to start your career or stay Union at UPS.
good,I used to meet the UPS driver on at a designated area. He would drop off the packages and I would deliver them to the different companies in the area until it was done.
good,Working at UPS was definitely a daily workout however the pay was not fit for a mother such as myself. I received less hours a week due to non available OT. I could not afford to pay any bills and get ready for my child. When working pregnant I was denied benefits once I grew too large to work also the environment was not baby friendly.
good,"Overall the company is a good one to work for, you just have to make sure to stay out of all of the drama that comes with it. Upper management definitely needs a lot of work."
good,Didnt work at ups i worked at The Ups Store they are franchised and owned by different individual's so im not sure if i should be able to comment on actual UPS although i have had the honor of meeting several UPS drives and they have all been nice and courteous
good,The pay for the work you do is not enough.  They don't have set work hours and if you are part time your only guranteed 3.5 hours a day. Its hard to get full time work.
good,"Unfair and unprofessional management practices.  Unfair labor procedures for contractors and temp employees.  The management lets employees run the facility.  Therefore, if you are not liked by a select group of individuals you will be terminated.  Cut throats"
good,yes its very difficul for me athe first day as a service provider eventully i can do this day by day now i think its my profational job actully its my first job now i want to change my compny
good,"Nice seasonal position however my biggest complaint is the amount of work your pressed with each day.  Some days we had over 340 stops which we didn't even get breaks for if we fell behind.  On days we were ahead we ended up having to help others who had fallen behind.  Work weeks were 40-70 hours which is very nice pay but you won't have the time to manage your personal life during this short period which includes holiday shopping and other obligations.  I had a really nice driver during this period of time, paid for my lunches when we did get them, and picked me up from my house rather than having me meet him in route.  This is a very demanding physical job and working in the cold weather didn't help.  I probably wouldn't do this job again however if your in a situation where you need work I recommend this job opportunity."
good,"Easy work, fast pace, stressless, hours are not guaranteed but are in the satisfactory category. Only hard part about the job would be that the managers would want to put fear in you as you work rather than influence you to work hard."
good,Pay is not very good and very little opportunity for advancement. I really do not like to write reviews regarding job experiences this is one of my least favorite aspects of indeed is that they force it.
good,It was a bigger potential if only better staffing. Staffing is everything. Management should treat the employees with a little more respect. The plant was old and everything in it was also. It just wasn't the best combination.
good,"UPS is too all over the place with their time management and management in general, its super stressful with timed  schedule of every state but always delays on certain planes or trucks, so causes frustrating working environment for everyone."
good,this is a part time job for older people  really. you work 4 to 5 hours a day thats if they put you on the schedule.  the lady that does the time she will take your  house if she dont like you
good,I enjoy to work there in ups its a multinational company and there is friendly atmosphere for all the employs spacialy supervisors and managers are very nice
good,There is no work life balance which eventually makes employees bitter and hate your position.. Alot of change is needed for the company.
good,"don't work here there is too may problems that go on. treated like horriable, abused as an employee, they will fire you over anything, don't pay well at all. it was just a job to have a job."
good,"Just said it,the company is good but management make the company bad,they just feel like the company belong  them,they don't work with people out of the company life"
good,"Some of the supervisors work with a toxic loaded gun mentality, waiting for any opportunity to use minor mistakes as a threshold to prove that perfectly good employees are bad employees, guilty until proven innocent"
good,"The trucks are almost never organized, the worst part about the job is  when it's freezing cold and raining outside. other than being very unorganized and having to work in inclement weather, the job is actually pretty laid back."
good,"I really enjoy UPS and the work I do.  Its frustrating though because I can never seem to really level up in the company.  I want to learn and grow and I volunteer daily for new jobs and experiences but, I do not seem to gain ground and keep it.  I am loyal and I work very hard and always will but, I would like to be rewarded."
good,Pre-loaded UPS delivery vehicles. Began the work day very early in the morning. Unloaded semi trucks full of heavy packaging for delivery to various locations.
good,It  has been a trying time working there from management to my old co-worker. There has been some issues an over all I'm not happy want to transfer out
good,"I learned how to handle certain situations better, but overall it's a constant cycle of poor management. The employees are great but there is constant nagging and complaining over the things that we have no control over or things that only the owner has access too. there is too much responsibility given to myself and the employees because he doesn't want to deal with it or is ""too stressed"""
good,"This job was an independent franchise, working under strict guide lines from a corporate office.No real opportunities for advancement, and no benefits to retire on."
good,"Had a great experience working here. It was a benefit from the company to provide transportation to and from work location. I learned how the packages are handled and loaded into the UPS trucks, delivery routes, and performed a lot of physical activity."
good,Not a terrible place to work its catered more to people that this is their first job. not very many employees there that take the job seriously alot of talking on the phones rather than completing the task at hand.
good,extremely competitive place to work. Constant monitoring of phone calls. timing of breaks down to the second. I did not care for the constant monitoring
good,"As seasonal help you have to be prepared to work long hours, they're hiring you because it is their busiest season. Be prepared to have blisters on your feet and word of advise if you are considering this break in your boots before you come... Yeah it hurts if you don't. I find it personally fascinating the logistics in everything. You don't deal to heavily with management. The drivers are hilarious, they're really humble as well, I do advise this as a good high school job."
good,"Not enough hours. Only 3 hours a night for hourlies. The building is extremely hot in the summer ! I feel like management has no respect especially the division manager, he treats everyone like their his kids."
good,Recommend for a college student but I would tell someone just looking for a job and no college to find somewhere else there is very low pay and the jobs not worth the money
good,A little too serious management they say work at a safe pace then expect these crazy high numbers of boxes per hour without any mistakes while they stand around judging you on your work and make comments like that trailer should’ve taken 45 minutes or less I can knock out a trailer like that in 30 what took you an hour and won’t dare help unless it’s a blue moon and your almost finished with the trailer anyways
good,Its good to keep a person moving but the overtime hours rate was changed from 5 and a half hours to after 8 hours. Last year was a lot better and worth it.
good,I had a ton of fun working here at first. Depending on management the building you work in can be great or it can be miserable. You start out in the union and supervision as part time and have to work your way up from there. Full-time spots are few and far between and all union positions are based on seniority and seniority only. FT jobs in supervision are few and far between and if you don't have a BS/BA you are going to be waiting 7 to 10 years. They are actually in the process of phasing in BS/BA degrees as full time supervision requirements. Most of the PT supervisors worked full time hours and the full time supervisors worked more than that. 10 hour 5 day work weeks in a standard for full time Supervisors. During the holidays be prepared to be at work for 15-20 hours a day.
good,Poorly management.Got unfairly terminated in behalf my injury. Unfairly workplace.but I sure did experience  and don't regret nothing. Just sure all negative  thing I have to say is management needs to be look in.
good,This place is the worst I am certain any other hub works differently This hub is the worst it's a who do you know place and oh don't start with management it's never enough or even trickled down this is worst place for communications thank God they're in Logistics can't say enough things about this HUB
good,"I was seasonally employed over the Christmas Holiday in 2017 in Richmond, Va. I actually loved working there! The pay was not very good, & there were no extra benefits since it was temporary, but I worked with some very nice & helpful drivers, plus I lost weight & got healthier so that was a huge benefit for me. It's a fairly easy job to learn & do. Basically each day consisted of me calling a phone # each morning to see if they needed my help that day. Sometimes I had to wait for them to call me back hours later to find out if I was working or not. If they needed my help, they told me where I would be meeting my driver at a very close location near my home, then we went on our route in the truck. My job was to hop out of the truck at stops while the driver handed me the packages, then I would carry them up to the customer's door, knock, & leave them there. Then hop back on the truck & do it all over again. It's a whole lot of fast paced walking, lifting, & carrying. Sometimes we had to work in rain or snow, so it's always good to bring extra clothes & wear lots of layers, & good walking shoes, & drink lots of water! Stretching is a must! Some days were very long & exhausting, but I never had any bad experiences working there (other than slipping on some leaves & falling once, twisting my ankle & scraping my knee). If you don't mind getting paid very little & like to stay moving, being physical, carrying up to 50 lbs or so, & also aren't afraid of dogs, then this is the job for you! Most customers were really nice too, which made the job even more rewarding. I thought my job"
good,It could be alot better if they actually cared about there employees. Im in need of a second income because one job isnt enough. It has its ups and downs but everyone does
good,Very interest to work .everyone get a new experience per day.best service all over the  world.increasing profile day by day.like feel free working with here.just do your job.!
good,"Although i learned a lot at this job, the management and lack thereof was the driver that made me quit. Even though i wasn't supposed to work overtime i was forced to and because of that the quality of my school work decreased significantly. After this i had brought it up with management and they showed more than an attitude of not caring. Currently 3 people are now hired to do the job that i was doing all by myself."
good,"anything could happen there people brought in personal items to have shipped. We also did copying, printing, scanning, binding, laminating, all types of office things. The shipping part was fun when we had to create a secure box for a large item."
good,it was a small store .but management was terrible..lack of training.the owner was a great person to work for but he lived in a different state and he was unaware of the things goin on with the store.it was a good steping stone for me.it wasent really a hard part of the job.i enjoyed that the customers used to come in an ask for me .
good,The job is an awesome position for college students building credentials in the working world. But there are essentially no growing opportunities.
good,"ALWAYS MEET A NEW PERSON starting the day "
good,"A typical day at work would start at 9 a.m. I would close around 530 p.m. It was a relaxed but busy body job. Constant printing/ customer service and packaging. I learned a lot about print production and how small businesses work. My co worker was great. later when more co workers were hired, we all didn't always get along but we dealt with each other. Hardest part was busy days non stop packing but it was great when you finished. "
good,"It was hard work and I worked many hours, and i would do it all again."
good,The store is a franchise store and the owner/manager know how to run business fair and how to talk to their employees.
good,The company was fun to work for.The people were nice.I also enjoyed the one hour lunch break.
good,The hours are long the pay is short the task are a lot. The job is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. But getting it takes some time. I’ve worked countless hours for doing everything from answering emails phones giving quotes scheduling pick ups handling customers who most of the time are the rudest people I’ve ever met
good,If UPS hires your directly than one should consider given opportunity but if you hire through recruiter then no Benefit . You will get no benefits and you have to do the same amount of work .
good,Not too bad. Flexible schedule for the most part. Pay is getting better slowly. Easy work not hard to learn. Good place to start out I guess. Learn a lot about mail.
good,"You go in do ya thing, eithee load or unload. Management doesnt talk much over the different sorts, which causes confusion between everyone. On of thw hardest parts it keeping a steady pace of moving boxes"
good,I loved the job itself however I didn't make enough cause the hours you got max was 20 a week not enough to live on  it was a fun place because the workers were cool supervisors were cool too the higher up people were the less cool they became though
good,"I had a lot of fun working for UPS because of the actual position. I wish the manager was better at training and didn't feel the need to keep me from learning more. I wish I could've stayed at this job, but the relationship with my manager began to make me feel uneasy."
good,This job pushes you and makes you question a lot about your work ability and how much you can accomplish professionally while on the work site. I would highly recommend that UPS look into providing a much better work environment.
good,You were there to work everything is on a time schedule. It is very fast paced environment. You have to be very observant because accidents can happen in a split second.
good,a typical day at work is i get scanned in thru security desk swipe card unload trucks then get scanned again at security desk then go home the hardest part of the job is liffting heavy stuff sometimes by yourself
good,"stressfull, fast pace. always moving between trucks loading and unloading. moving around the warehouse is fast and stressfull. hot and cold during seasons."
good,"Het is een leuk bedrijf met gezellige mensen, alleen is het heel jammer dat ik niet de mogelijkheid krijg. Om verder te leren en te ontwikkelen, ik doe nu all meer dan 1 jaar de zelfde werkzaamheden. Het leek me leuk om pharma te doen of master Airwaybills af te sluiten."
good,"UPS was my first time taking on a seasonal pre-loading job. It was 5am - 9am Monday-Friday after Thanksgiving leading to Christmas."
good,Had up and downs with company.  Eventually forced out in order to bring in less expensive consultants.  Worked there a long time and was given almost no Severance package.
good,"Working for UPS as a driver, clerk, or even a dock worker is a great job. Management positions require 14 to 16 hours a day, almost no training, and no back up."
good,"Worked the Holiday weeks of the preload shift as an unloader. Very fast-paced and stressful position, however it was very beneficial for the time period of when I worked."
good,"A fast paced work environment  that required a lot of physical activity, It was a very stressful environment as you were constantly moving delivering packages in neighborhoods."
good,Driver Helper is seasonal. Fast pace. Its like playing 3 games of Basketball with no timeouts & no halftime. Pay is decent. Its just a seasonal job to make extra cash.
good,"I loved working at ups, I was even trying to become a full-time employee. The only thing I ever had a problem with us a few employees. I worked Monday- Friday from 6 pm to whenever the last package driver in my area came in the latest I stayed was almost 2 am. The hardest part of the job was trying to find packages that were not in the proper place."
good,Este trabajo tiene sus altas y bajas pero los compañeros hacen que sea mas divertida la faena.
good,"i never received  enough hours due to the route dispatchers being uncoordinated and would simply forget to call me. I worked like 10 hours a week due to this, completely wasting my time."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced delivery of parcels.  Door to door or
good,"unloading metal ,tires, big boxes, little box. i learned not to go back there management was not bad but the work culture was not for me the hardest part was time frame the experience"
good,I was a hired as a seasonal walker for the christmas season.  Loved being outside and busy.  But the union dues for a seasonal worker are ridiculous.  First you should not even come close to paying the dues of a part time worker or if any.  You pay exactly what a part time worker would pay even though your hours will vary week to week (4-28hrs).  When they take off union dues sometimes you are left with nothing!!  Remember your paid minimum wage!!  Also the criminal record check is a joke.  They make you pay for it but don't give you any proof that it was ever done.
good,just bad extremely bad. you just run and deliver packages for no  money . its hard work cause u gotta read them write not worth it for the money especially if it is seasons
good,I worked for UPS while going to school. The hours work well with a college schedule and its relatively easy work for decent pay. If you're a morning person I highly suggest it.
good,"Working at Ups was fun, sometimes is can be very stressful, there is a lot of pressure put on employees with immature management.  I enjoyed my coworkers though."
good,Travail En équipe solidaire entre nous et polyvalent
good,Busy environment for seasonal work with a  reasonable pay rate. Opportunity given to stay on as a permanent employee for a certain amount of people. Would go back to work for them during the holiday season.
good,Ups is fast pace work environment . There always something to do there. the work environment is very hostile. the management there are at times very mean. And they don't seem to respect hard work.
good,"Need better employee hours, need better communications with the employees are employees need safety training all employees should be given phone numbers of all the upper management staff"
good,"The stress is immense and I will consume you regardless of how good you are. The hours are weird, the benefits are good but the culture is awful and you are always being pushed to your limits, often beyond."
good,At first when I start at ups I love it came to work on time work hard  trying the difference group and move up in the company then when I been there for a couple months I seen alot of changing and seen it like how a  new CEO of a company come in and start shifting everything around that how it is at ups only now you work hard n you get out late
good,"Pleasent enviroment, Training is minimial,not much feedback on learning process of the proper procedures. Learning on the job,with packing and processing of packages. Would have appreciated more feedback on learning the procedures. Did not know that they were not happy with my performance until it was too late. When they told me I was not a ""good Fit""."
good,Engaging current and prospective customers with various promotional programs offered by UPS to target business development.
good,Work in conjuction with the Driver to deliver packges to the customer.I also maintain the truck organize. ihave a goood relationship with my assing driver
good,"It was a seasonal position."
good,"Was and now not a good company to work at."
good,"Face paced, customer service "
good,Calling into work at 7 am for the (seasonal) on-call position. Being versed in package delivery and safety procedures. Management were very thorough with expectations and company policy. Co-workers were helpful. Job was outside and winter weather can be harsh at times but the job was very energizing; making one very alert
good,"I waited too many years to get a full time job. You could work part time for many years before you would have a chance to work full time. 3.5 per day, can' live on that"
good,"Usually a 5 hour work day"
good,"Balance and reconciled on Cash on Delivery, good management from manager on getting work done on time. Enjoyed my assistants from co-workers, the hardest part was getting lay off from work and enjoyed my co-workers friendly faces."
good,I loved coming to work socializing with the patients and gaining their trust
good,Helping the driver with delivers. Driver were good to work with. Not a hard job.
good,"Meu trabalho era bem tranquilo, aprendi e adquirir experiencia em minha area de atuação, minha gerencia era tranquila, colegas tranquilo, e o que me agradava era a estar adquirindo experiencia em minha profissão."
good,"I enjoyed this job so much, working with customers, solving problems, developed marketing and business strategies, I gained customer service experience and management experience in the retail industry."
good,very long day but i never mind. mangers are very disrespectful to everybody. everybody else was very helpful with helping out and being very friendly.
good,"It was an exhilarating experience working at UPS where the culture was mad teamwork, alternative excercises, incentives, and an amazing training team. Unfortunately, the management fell short in other departments outside of the training and prep department. I mean, their security team was pretty amazing too, but I didn't know that until about two weeks in, which is when I was being escorted out lol."
good,Working at ups wasn’t the easiest I got through it but what I learned was labor wasn’t my best option management was horrible everything was exhausting.
good,"I worked for UPS for 3 years, all were seasonal work. Every year by the end of my first week of work, I remembered I didn't care to much for the job and then, the last 2 / 3 weeks of the season I always remembered it's really not that bad of a job and I enjoyed it, and then the season would be over. 😔 But over all, I wish It would turn into full time, life time career and me retiring with this company."
good,This job I didn’t like only because it was bad management. They were to aggressive with how they went about things and they yell at you to keep going fast.
good,Its A Good Job Just Have To Stay On Top Of Pay And Your Hourly Pay Rate. The Environment Is Welcoming And Is More Of A We Do Good Safe Work Rather Then Dangerous .
good,I would have loved to get full time but they never gave me that opportunity. The routes we pretty normal some vehicles were out dated. Outside of that is was a good experience. Most co workers were very helpful
good,"Low pay for seasonal job "
good,"They try to promise you hours but they never fall through. I was barely working 20 hours , my checks weekly didn’t even reach $100 (I can’t do nothing with that)"
good,"A typical day at The UPS Store consist of greeting guest as they enter the store and working with the customer to fill out shipping information to sent off packages. Some times I would also pack items for shipment, management was run by the owner of the store and a co-manager. Work culture was fairly diverse, the hardest part of the job was packaging items and making sure no damage would be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was interreacting with new people everyday and talking with everyone."
good,Great place to work if you like night hours.... certain nights don't expect to work much hours your hours shift from day to day but relaxed atmosphere
good,I really enjoyed packing the packages to make sure peoples valuables got to their destation in one piece.  I also got to know a lot of regulars who always made my day.
good,very fast paced environment. If your going to be a package handler make sure you can lift over 110 lbs. They sometimes come over the belt and if you cant lift it they stop the belt.
good,It's a nice place to work there are just some managers that are lazy and don't like to help to assist when your overwhelmed and need help. They should give better training to preload workers so they fully understand how to do it
good,"I injured my left rotater cuff on my left shoulder so I applied to be a driver instead of working air secondary sorting Packages to be driven to the air port. "
good,"Just like any job they have their pros and cons. UPS is no different, it's great to be outside and enjoying the nicer weather. However in the winter it gets complicated when the weather switches. Also as with most if the provider beside you is lazy you have to pick up their slack(yes its expected). Overall it comes down to what you make of it, coming to work in a good mood always helps."
good,Not flexible and unorganized. Finished training and not assigned a territory. No organization regarding promotions. No work life balance and very strict on timing.
good,"Management of the helpers is not the most organized system. It is a highly physical exhausting job, when done well.  Many work one day and never come back. As it is currently structured, it is very difficult to support an adult on the scheduled hours and the salary.  If the compensation were more than minimum wage and the schedules more organized, UPS and its managers might find that more people are willing to stay and work well."
good,"Work can be challenging, but there is no longer job security like there use to be. Changes every day. Upper Manaagement changes are very stressful and make the job very difficult."
good,Good for part time work and if you want to build your career with the UPS company.  Good experience with customers on a daily.  Learning the business for franchise
good,"Loading and unloading packages for delivery to residential and commercial properties which requires coding and scanning, and lifting packages up to 75 pounds. Moving in and out of heavy traffic which would include inclement weather"
good,"Dress comfortable in the summer it can be very hot and in the winter very cold , WATER WATER WATER Always stay hydrated, lift packages with your knees, & your labels should always be up"
good,enjoyed the fast paced environment of unloading and reloading the tractor trailers and delivery trucks.  The people I worked with were all easy going guys and funny which made the day go fast and everyone worked as a team to accomplish the job
good,"The corporate culture identifies and communicates high standards and values.  These standards and values, however, do not make it all the way down to the rank and file in operations.  Hourly work is very difficult and physically demanding.  Operations supervisors do not get paid much more than starting union workers and annual increases are anemic.  The limited hours and limited salary make this job unsustainable without the Earn and Learn program which is amazing.  UPS full-time management positions require tenure or a degree and there is currently no program to reap the benefits of the extensive educational assistance UPS provides.  Graduating seniors are not considered for work until the diploma is in hand and competitors are able to skim the best of the best months before graduation as a result.  Lower level managers, therefore, tend to be uneducated, unskilled communicators who know the job well but lack management acumen and were advanced within due to tenure.  Corporate goals are lofty and clear but see weak translation into operations culture."
good,Very fast paced job. Knowledge of product and procedures are very important. Listing to customer needs is a must. International shipping requires patience and time.
good,"Good seasonal job. You work long hours so there's the potential to make good money and a lot of over time. No experience was required, just wanted you to be able to lift a certain amount. Can be an intense job.  Minimum wage."
good,"Good people and challenging environment. Unfortunately it's increasingly crippled by inept management and poor promotional decisions. Since the company went public it has been downhill for the employees and customers - all the emphasis is on the numbers, not the impact they have on the people affected by the company."
good,Just had to stay focused on my work and my job because there are a lot of distractions. And don’t plan on doing anything but staying to your self because people just want to socialize and that’s not what we are there for
good,"Flow of customers, in person or over the phone, with picks and downs during a day."
good,"This job was fairly simple, as long as you listened to directions, and did what the driver told you to do. In my personal experience, the people who work here do their due diligence to get parcels to their respected destinations during the holidays."
good,I really enjoyed working at this location because of the regular clientele. Developed good rapport with many customers. I learned a lot about working in a retail environment which was very worth while. Since the UPS stores are a franchise you feel like you work for a corporation but the culture is more like a Mom and Pop shop. Since I facilitated client needs for graphic design projects I learned about how to communicate and work with clients. Understanding about supply and demand of the industry.
good,"Simple, fast pace. If you need a job and willing to work up to 12 hours a day, go for it! But go for the driver position. Package handler are let go with out notice."
good,I've learned to be a good worker and improve my learning and working skills by paying attention and branching off what I've learned and teaching it to others.
good,It was good while it lasted .I had so many good friend.Most of my life long friends I met at ups.It was a place that will put you the test.I loved it but it is time to move on.
good,"Very fast paced and little room for error.  Very hot working conditions. need to be able to load at least 7 packages per minute, harder than it sounds.  Pay does not equal the amount and intensity of job duties."
good,"Great work, great team, people and learning experience for becoming a better human being and amazing customer service development skills and interacting with people. Too much interference with my personal life and space."
good,"This position of package handler is extremely physical. From the time I clock in til the time I clock out I handle packages of all shapes, sizes and weight in a warehouse environment that is extremely hot.  I then load UPS trucks with these packages according to size and zip code.  The trucks are also very hot.  We are given 2 small breaks during the five hour shift. I am often asked to work overtime because there are some who like to ""slack off"" although work still needs to be completed by a deadline.  I want to get the job done and been consistent in all I have been assigned to do."
good,the lower you are in seniority the more and harder work you are given to do favoritismis rampid and in your face especially when it comes to seniority very unfair
good,"Very accommodating work schedule, good support with understanding job requirements, ok compensation, worked as a team to get nightly requirements accomplished, good understanding of job duties, worked well with other employees"
good,"-I learned that people sometimes go about their jobs out of necessity rather than wanting to do their best"
good,"De werkdruk bij UPS ligt erg hoog, lukt een bepaald cijfertje niet te halen dan word je er voor gestraft. Daardoor zijn de chauffeurs niet blij en het werk word niet gewaardeerd. Niet leuk om te werken dus. Ik heb voorderest wel veel geleerd bij ups: (live planning etc). Management neemt de tijd niet voor je. Collega's zijn leuk, maar niet allemaal. Moeilijkste van de baan is toch wel de werk druk. Leukste van de baan is af en toe lachen met leuke en lachwekkende collega's"
good,"heavy lifting at a fast pace"
good,"A typical day at UPS would include loading trailers full of packages. The job very physical and tiresome. The hard part of the job was loading packages that were over 50 pounds. The most enjoyable part was that everyday would be a work out, hence the job will keep you very fit."
good,"Once you go into part time management, they  will look for any excuse to get rid of you."
good,"Wake up early in the morning after going to bed at like 7 am to do the same job by myself everyday, when i a actually work if they don't send me home because it is slow all the time"
good,"Volunteering in constantly pushed at UPS, but only if it is associated with Metro United Way. Sometimes the people we end up volunteering for have better clothes and cars than we do."
good,I love that each store is individually owned and operated. That is also the downside. Since things are ran at the discretion of owners the pay and job responsibility's differ as well as store hours.
good,"Ups is great place to work but its a warehouse so it get cold in the winter "
good,I feel like the job would have been better if they would have paid more or gave up more hours but it's a good job for you know college students just trying to make good money on the side or for second job for someone but not someone who's been there for a while
good,This was seasonal work with no full-time -permanent opportunities offered.   Good job for extra cash and while going to school.  Hours were limited.
good,ups was an ok place to work it was way out the box for me it was my first time working outside of Delaware I got to meet all kinds of new people
good,très bon entreprise des horaires certes très tôt le matin mais au moins on reste disponible toute les après midi
good,the job itself was easy but HR. Was a real pain she was not professional at all.. so overall the work easy people In power not so good at all
good,The manager always try to say a joke once a while to make us laugh. Especially with our customers the fact they always seem happy and conversational is fun.
good,"hours vary, no balance between work and home, benefits okay, advancement impossible and preselected. raises are lacking"
good,typical day a work was hot riding on this big truck with hundred of packages delivering to residents and business. I learned how to use the clipboard logging in packages and receiving signatures for them if needed.
good,Working as a seasonal driver helper was a great job to make some extra money. Not much opportunity for advancement though.
good,"Loved every minute of this job. Super stressful and over bearing but so fun. It's a bittersweet job. My Manger was awesome. So I was Lucky. Training is the best in the world. One day then given the keys. If you do best under extreme stress. Then you will excel here. If you are sensitive. Not for you. Clock in, ger r done, clock out. Must be good with memory and sense of direction.  Great job for infantryman."
good,"Good place to work, many different oppertunities within the company"
good,"United Parcel Service, Inc. is a package delivery company, which provides global package delivery and supply chain management services. It offers logistics services to the global market, which include transportation, distribution, forwarding, ground, ocean and air freight, brokerage and financing. It's pretty cool wearing the brown uniform, with fast paced customer service on the go."
good,UPS Driver Helper was a seasonal position and while I enjoyed doing the things the job required of me I felt like the people in charge of dispatch for Driver Helpers didn't use me unless someone didn't show up for their job despite performing well in the chances I got to work.
good,"greet customers. answers phone calls, package items. such as pictures, paintings, watches, bags, tires etc."
good,"Handling distributors and modern trade outlet as well as retails."
good,"Although I enjoyed my short time as a seasonal package helper, I was hoping for permanent placement. I ranked high among my competition but still wasn't hired in. Be ready to work vs slowing the drivers down as you will find yourself not being called back. I also did not like that they typically only let the helpers work 4 hours out of the day."
good,It was a great pleasure to interact with an variety of customers
good,wish i never would have left... would make a great full time job.
good,"Work is very fast paced. I have learned a great deal about how to manage people and work with employees to get the highest results. Management is good. My boss is the greatest boss I have ever worked for. Co-workers work hard and UPS promotes a great team atmosphere. Hardest part of the job is dealing with outside adversities etc. traffic, weather. Most enjoyable part of the job is making sure that the customers get there shipments on time. I treated every package as if it was my grandmothers and it was the most important shipment in the world."
good,"Busy, hard work for people who are willing to do it. Safe driving required."
good,"I like to be challenge, a need job first of all because I have bills to pay but specially I like to work I enjoy working, I need an environment where people is busy and there is always something to do. I like to be in constant movement."
good,"The day starts with the completion of daily reports and deposits, assisting customers with printing, notary and pack and ship needs - I've learned to multi task with completion of all tasks and customer satisfaction with in a time frame the customer expects. The hardest part of this job has been the lifting of the more heavier packages and dealing with frustrated customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with the associates and watching them learn how to do their job."
good,I start the day with open the store and making surethe store is clean and ready to go for the day.I pack and ship items that customers wants to send. I have good Co- workers and a good manager.There is not hard part about my job.
good,Part-Time. The manager was very nice. Cared for his subordinates. Work was sporadic so the hours never stayed the same. Far distance to travel at night. But compensation was very good.
good,Meeting up with the driver of the UPS truck and delivering packages to various homes and companies. What I learned was the skill to work indepently and to pull my own weight. All of my co-workers being male I loved how they treated me as a equal. I really appreciated because although I am a female I do not want special treatment.
good,"It was a faster paced environment, some day were busy some were a bit slower. I learned how to use their handheld computer and I delivered packages to multiple places in Devonshire mall."
good,My hours at UPS started at 8:30 when i get to work my truck was never pack on time for me to leave to start delivery my packages. That was very unprofessional our time was always off. The job within itself is very unprofessional
good,"So it was really difficult getting use to going into work at 1:30 am and all the heavy lifting.  I am a small girl only at 5'1"", so it was challenging and hard work.  But UPS has great benefits!"
good,"It's worth it if you can get past the difficulty of the work. The benefits, courtesy of the union, are top notch. The pay isn't horrible either. Just work consistently and safely."
good,"Am schwierigsten war die körperliche Belastung und auch einseitige Bewegung. Angenehm war, dass ich trotz meiner noch verbesserungswurdigen Deutschkenntnisse anerkannt war."
good,They don’t respect the employees. They don’t know how to retain their employees. No promotion because of favouritism. Salary is good and colleagues were awesome.
good,"The UPS Store can be a good place for those in college just starting out. They offer decent pay and available raises for part-time employees. Due to how much shopping is done online, our store was very busy constantly. While I was there, I acted as Manager, associate, print head, and notary."
good,Poor work environment. There was no set schedule for employees. Some days we would show to work and they would send us home immediately and it felt like a west of time.
good,"This Job doesn’t give me good hours that I need to sustain a balanced lifestyle. The management is poor. The Labor work in this building is very poor as we have no AC in the building, work conditions are poor."
good,"Empresa q exige demasiado sin mirar a sus empleados. Corta horas , cuando les da la gana"
good,"The UPS management team is out of touch with the realities and the expectations of today's work force. It is frankly embarrassing how often UPS pushes people out. Managers provide almost no support to employees in advanced roles. They don't clear barriers, provide direction, or help develop the skills necessary to reduce stress, time in the office, and overall role competency."
good,High paced working environment with much needed attention to detail and computer proficiency is a must have. Must have an eye for thinking fast and making decisions quickly
good,"Working like a dog for an amount of money. Positive thinking, you get a free workout while on the job. Direct Management were good but above were not so good. They ""did their jobs"", some were great some weren't in understanding of what they even needed you to do. Always in between different supervisors & being moved which was multitasking many many things. I was even screwed over on my benefits. Which was mainly what I waited for."
good,"When they didn’t need me anymore they didn’t tell me anything. Just said they would call, of course they never did. Had problems when others loaded trucks I was supposed to be loading. Ups said it’s still your responsibility even though the drivers would just take off."
good,"management does not communicate anything, when they make mistakes its your fault, no training was provided bye center management, if you work hard they just give you twice as much to do"
good,"the pay was very bad.  there were no benefits of any kind, they did not want to give hours.  the salary was very low from the minimum at that time.  if it were not for those reasons I would have put more interest in staying because I really loved work and learned many different things!"
good,"There is no way to grow in the company, 95% of the place are temps. Even when you work hard, do overtime, and they say they love having you. Its just words. They will get rid of you in a heartbeat if they felt like it. "
good,"I enjoyed the manager at the time, he was relaxed yet you had his respect and you respected him. He never yelled if there was a problem. The people in the office were friendly and were always available to help you."
good,My experience at UPS has been exciting  my salary wasant helping out with paying bills. The people there are very nice and very hard working and very driven to staying with the company
good,"I like working for ups I get along with my staff.My supervisor is great,and I get paid weekly..It part time,but it helps me with bills and gas getting threw the work week."
good,"I feel like all I am is a number to this company. The department that I work has made me not want to try to go to any other department regardless of how others say they are treated outside of customer service. To be micro managed and treated like a child is totally unacceptable. The amount of work that is expected from you with no compensation is sad from a company of this magnitude. The freight side of this company's customer service department, from my experience, is not the way to go."
good,"My particular job was only temporary for the Christmas season. Pay was okay, hours sporadic, management incompetent. The job is very physically demanding but not excessive. During non peak season not terrible for families."
good,Shipping & Handling scanning boxes and helping out with deliveries from time to time checking labels and cleaning up after my working hours signing out
good,"Idk what these other reviews are talking about with not getting enough hours. I work at the Raleigh location on Atlantic Springs and i average 6-7 hours a day. Recently i've been going in at 11:00am and not getting off until 9:30pm. So the hours isn't the issue. The issue is not knowing when you are going to get off until you meet with your driver that day. I am in pretty good shape and i believe the work you do on a daily basis, is not worth what they pay you. They currently pay us $13 per hour. Be warned...you will be running all day long, sometimes carrying boxes weighing over 50lbs. Direct deposit isnt offered since we are temporary so you will be receiving paper checks. There were some days we had over 250 stops and those are the days where you will be working all day long, until about 10pm at night. My driver is really nice, we get along really well. He helps out a lot in neighborhoods when the stops are right across from eachother. He gets one and i get the other. There are other times where i am about 5-6 houses down and i have to run all the way down there with about 5-6 packages and he comes to pick me up. Honestly the work is not bad if you are in good shape, but if you dislike running, then this job is not for you."
good,"UPS is an old, well known company. They are struggling to keep up with the current culture and as such are struggling financially to continue to operate at a profit. They are extremely hierarchical and do not lend themselves likely to enhance their company, preferring to stay with the age old: 'if it is not broken, do not fix it' attitude. This leads to dead weight around the offices and people not completing tasks."
good,"UPS will test you in every way that you can imagine. The hours are long and hard. The benefits are great. If you screw up, you are fired. I would not have left if I was not injured."
good,"Very hard work, long hours, good pay and benefits. Work in elements,  when it is hot, it's hot, when it's cold, you're cold. They often don't leave you time for your required hour break. They overload the packages cars with unrealistic expectations."
good,Co-workers were good hard working people that got their jobs done in a timely manner. Management lacked the skills to communicate and handle their employees.
good,"Das Paketvolumen wächst stetig und die Zahl der Mitarbeiter... hmmm... das Internet boomt die Gewinne auch aber UNTEN bei denen die UPS verkörpern jeden Tag kommt es nicht wirklich an. Das menschliche geht total verloren. Du bekommst schlecht Urlaub oder frei für Termine, Arzt, Behörden etc...Weil die Pakete nicht sonst auf die Strasse kommen. Der Lohn ist überdurchschnittlich aber zu lasten der Familie und der Gesundheit."
good,"Work Life balance depends on your management team.   Work is interesting, work load is not evenly distributed.Your career is hinged on your managers support. Recent transformation does not appear to be thought out well causing unneeded confusion/stress."
good,"I learned how to manage a work group of six to twenty employees, how to hold those employees accountable, and how to drive numbers in such a fast pace industry."
good,"Fast paced environment where you have to handle daily changing conditions in work load and weather. Management is strict considering customers want instant gratification on shipping expectations. There's no laughing matter when you are behind the wheel of a package car, so seriousness is needed."
good,"Several occasions that the manager administration had not received invoices from property management. This causes a ripple against who’s in charge. One site can crumble if everything isn’t documented on the next shift. There’s so much going on but nobody gets the chance to do the right work. Don’t be a follower, be a leader please if you sign up."
good,Work was fast paced and hard. We didn't get that many breaks or time to really eat. The culture was good. The hardest part was moving heavy packages alone sometimes in the truck.
good,A typical day at work consisted of processing checks- opening payments- organizing billing payments- maintaining an organized desk at all times- being able to manage time wisely
good,"Fast paced environment, miserable employees who work two jobs,  pay really is not enough for the work that is performed, takes to long to get paid what you should be starting with!"
good,I am in the general office. Mostly nice and laid back. Never recieved positive reinforcement. Only hear from management if you did something wrong. Used to be overnite transportation (family company) now becoming more and more corporate. Would love to continue working here if managers weren't so nitpicky or if transferring to another location was not nearly impossible if your life is not in danger.
good,Busy shipping company. Management is overworked and over-stressed. Consistently short staffed for operation due to low wage for hourly workers. Difficult to survive as a part-time employee.
good,"Ii used to love my job, I started as a pre-loader, moved  to pre loader Supervisor when the position opened.  All the staff all got along everyone came to work at 3:30 A.M. there where a few issues here an there, yet training an commutation go a long way hand in hand."
good,"Bilingual public notary, bilingual leader. Provided extensive information benefiting both business and customers. In charge of all digital design and printing. Assist with packing and shipping services, process/assist with level 2 background checks. Maintain clean and welcoming environment for both co-worker and customers. In charge of all the stores promotional marketing. Learned to take initiative on management daily duties and decisions."
good,"It's a tough company that will make or break you.  Christmas will never be the same, but the culture will teach you a lot about what you can take.  Be mindful of balance."
good,Ive worked here for 8 yrs at 2 facilities and the Northern Va UPS is lacking in management pride and respect for their employees. We are numbers not people.
good,Had the opportunity to work at UPS. The team was efficient and the place was running smoothly. They trained me well while maintaining day to day operations.
good,overall I've enjoyed working at UPS but I'm looking to find other jobs to see if one will spark my interest and potentially be something I can work for long term
good,"Lack of management skills, treat employees horrible, no respect, care about numbers more than helping to improve employee production, work life balance does not exist"
good,"ups was a fun place to work. typically worked 5 hours, loading delivery trucks. fast paced environment. early day working part time with time to spare for the rest of the day."
good,"If a loader, you're the bottom of the totem pole, you will get treated harshly, and will also be subject to verbal abuse, not the ideal situation, but benefits do make up for it. All in all , its not a bad place to work, as long as you're a driver."
good,I worked there for over twenty years we did get raises every year and had pretty good benefits.The work was a constant pace and management can be demanding at times.if you are young it's a pretty good entry level job.Advancement is up to you but can take time
good,"Working at UPS I learned to work extremely fast while lifting heavy items.  Most of the others who are employed are friendly and helpful.  Some of the supervisors were rude, communicated poorly with staff, and very impatient."
good,"They expect you to keep a fast pace and be there when they need you. You'll have to keep your energy level up consistently and live with no lunch break and minimal rest."
good,This is a tough job and if your not physically fit it may give you some problems. You may be out all night delivering packages. When I started it was peak season so it was really rough October through December but I made it through.
good,I was only hired for the holiday help but they have decided to keep me on part time. I only work 2 maybe 3 days a week and the days are usually only 5 hour days early mornings (4am-9am) so it's not bad since I can have a full time job as well and not have to choose. Good for extra income and eventually get into the company's union which has great benefits.
good,Learned how to multitask real quick. Management was good but there was no going up in the business. Kept my typing skills polished and may have even improved them a bit.
good,Typical day was delivering about 200-300 packages on any given route. Good experience with customer service and organization skills.  Enjoyed the hands on training with the seasoned drivers.
good,"Easy work, just not well paid. Wish I had more hours. "
good,"Hard work on a timely basis . Be ready to work at a fast pace with the ability to gain . Ups pre loaders play a big role, neatness , patients , attitude . Would be a good fit for this job"
good,"Hard to select some answers honestly about management,I was a driver helper and didn't interact with them much.I was left hanging several times about working,I'd get up and be ready to go,UPS would either call me to work,then never heard from a driver to meet for work that day.Or not return my calls when offering to work that day."
good,Since new management not able to understand what they want. They want results without support and team work. Working enviroment has change and company is very good at global level but in India same Indian people mentality and showing boss giri.
good,"Was a great place to work that provided good experience for later. Was able to establish skills not only in packing and shipping, but with specific niches such as passport photo taking, document editing for legal use, scanning and printing services, and so much more."
good,"C'est une compagnie assez interessante ou c'est pas trop payant des le part,il te donne beaucoup d'uniforme"
good,"● Loading and distributing packages to designated areas"
good,"clean and safe work place. good leadership, great teamwork. fair responsibilities. grateful staff, we receive compliments for good work and breaks when over worked."
good,"Generally a good, fun and busy company to work for. Everyday brings something new, whether it is something simple as making a copy for an elderly customer to packing and shipping personal belongings of a college student.The best part is knowing the value of your service and seeing  the satisfaction on the customers face when they leave."
good,"Fun place to work, but each location is a franchise so it is difficult to know what to expect. Corporate does not play a strong role in the company. Good first job, no chance to move up."
good,"very early start times are hard to get used to. Management are often ill prepared for problems that come up, sometimes out of their control. Hectic work environment, very short breaks, and during peak  you will have long hours."
good,Hot and stressful back breaking work short break and the work place was very disorganized was paid less for working overtime and not paid correctly for overtime
good,loading multiple trucks can be a burden but you will manage with coaching they give you. just apply the procedure  that the managers shower you and you will be successful
good,Nice pay and good work. Management and policies are inconsistent and out dated. Company does not want you taking time off even if you have the time. The professional side of UPS is non-union so you have no representation at the work place which puts more control of management over the workers
good,Office environment for a warehouse man...wasn't the best setup but it worked. Good classic vibe throughout. Everyone looked out for one another as well.
good,UPS was a hostile work place only because everyone is being told to go faster and there is a constant get it done attitude. On average day i would sort through 8 to 10 thousand parcels and load/unload on average 4500 parcel. Most i did in one day was i loaded onto 3 52 footers 6700 parcels. this job is great for a second job or while someone is in school.
good,"Flexible hours, relaxed environment. No health benefits. No opportunity for career advancement and low pay. ................................................................."
good,"UPS is time consuming, you never get off of work on scheduled time but on the bright side, lots of OT pay. All weather type of job."
good,"Original culture has changed for the worse. "
good,"The UPS i worked at, was a small store outside of Pittsburgh. The management was bad. The co-workers were really nice. It was a good job, but it was hard to work with the owner."
good,Very easy job. A lot of labor work and must be capable to lift heavy items. Works well if a second job is needed. The ups stores are franchised
good,Not enough money for the job that has to be performed.  It's a fast paced 4 hr workout. And you have limited time to get thousands of packages into a truck neatly.
good,"Aside from the company being as huge as it is, it's employees could stand to have better customer service. They could also stand to take pride in their work environment and care about what happens to the customers packages."
good,Most of my co-workers and manager were helpful and friendly. I learned how to help run a store. It was just unfortunate that I worked full time 40 hour weeks with no benefits.
good,"Has  unrealistic expectations on production.   Not enough training even for long-term employees when  substantial job  duty changes are made.   System  was  constantly  requiring  fixes.   used to be  a great  place to work. "
good,"I was a drivers helper during the crazy busy Christmas season. Worked hard all day sometimes working 10 hours a day. I liked getting paid weekly and I liked the checks that I got. However, the job was very tiring. I slept good when I got home. Only worked there for about 3 weeks so I can't give a thorough review of the job."
good,"I liked the job overall, typical day was going into a trailer and they let you listen to music. I would unload trailers of varying sizes. I was let go because the supervisor had a personal grudge against my cousin at the job. Was very unfortunate because i enjoyed the work. It takes  a LONG time to be considered for a full time position. If you go through the loader positions it could take 10 years."
good,"In this job my experience is variety in Customer service. Attending the clients for doing every work and reciving postal cards and draw in PMB. Packiging the articule with sending by UPS, DHL, USPS, FEDEX or Isaland Wide. Work Copy Machine Aficio and Plan Copier. Adquired knowlegde in all areas."
good,The work day is short as a loader. You go in everyday to work as fast as you possibly can to load your trucks before they need to be out for delivery.
good,Each day is a different experience as hours and work change daily and the need to adapt quickly is a must. I have learned how to deal with different individuals and team members effectively to produce our greatest result as a whole.
good,"Processing mail 400 pcs per hour"
good,Supervisors tell you what to do and if upper management finds out they don't remember what they told you and let you take the fall
good,"UPS is a very challenging and interesting place to work.  Good people and challenging work make it a decent career, but the old fashioned culture and below-market compensation are challenging."
good,the job is good if you have a good manager.  my last one is why i quit.  you can only advance in the company if the manager likes you.
good,"This company is everything to be expected going into it. They tell you what is to be expected as far as labor. You know you're going to have to work hard and continuously lift heavy packages, the only thing they don't tell you is the unrealistic expectations management is forced to force on us. At first if it seems difficult it definitely takes some getting used to and although your supervisor might yell at you to work hard or produce more flow (because they have to) but ALWAYS keep in mind to work with in your limits. Performing the UPS duties is not the difficult part, trying to stay away from the negativity of others would be in my opinion the most difficult. A bad attitude in this environment is toxic and will make you miserable and hate your job. Its honestly not THAT bad, you're there for 4-5 hours just get it over with!! Keep to yourself and perform the job you signed up for the best you can and with as little complaining as possible and you will be golden!!! Otherwise the benefits and job security this company offers is so worth it and should make you happy in the long run."
good,Intense work environment taking care of dedicated customers. Great rewards in the people you meet along the way. Overall a good experience.
good,"Most of my days were isolated, as the warehouse was a ""one-man shop"". There was difficulty in communicating with upper management and ultimately, after I had already left, There was no room for advancement. I enjoyed the independence that I was gave, knowing that I was entrusted to get the job done."
good,Worked here while in college was a great place to work for a college student. Learned a lot while working here. Great work ethic was gained while working here.
good,Its a blue collar hard hat job its nothing easy about consistent physical labor but if you like it knock yourself out its like a foot/ufc training for everyone who works there.
good,Worked maybe 2 weeks of my 1 month employment due to lack of work. Drivers were very kind and accommodating to needs of the helpers
good,I liked UPS because of the competitiveness and the work environment. Working for UPS helped me gain better social skills.
good,You will learn a hard day's work. Great place to work the only down side is that it can take up to 10 years to get a full time job
good,"They own you, and try every way to protect there name. I once got injured there and refused to give me a day off, or even see my own doctor."
good,unload the freight trucks onto a conveyer belt go from truck to truck only had a 15 minute break throughout the day
good,"A typical day at UPS Store was steady...I enjoyed working with people. Shipping and receiving and maintain the customers mailbox accounts was my main duty. "
good,Show up and unload boxes from a trailer.  Not much to learn.  Management was 50/50.  Just a huge mix of people.  Dealing with managers that are out to just get people in trouble are counter productive.  It is a great workout.
good,"was a very fast pace job WORK 12 to 930 "
good,its a job I am too fond of only because you must cut your beard off to work for no more than minimum wage. and there is no way to get a permanent position their.
good,Excellent work experience.  Was able to grow professionally.  Self development was very big at UPS.
good,"10 hrs. a day,non-stop,to get the job done,with the amount of work they put on you per day."
good,"Its great if you'd like to continue your schooling and education. If not then it is not a good place to work. Not a good environment, not enough hours and not a good salary."
good,"El equipo de trabajo es muy colaborador, el trabajo es muy amañador lo que afecta es la poca estabilidad que se brinda"
good,"My typical work day would consist of payroll processing, adjusting pay and time cards, entering third party information into the database, and entering W-4 information. Through training from other co-workers, I was able to process employee's paychecks, correct W-2's so employee's could file their taxes, and answer alot of Third-Party questions. The hardest part of the job was trying to help fix the Third-Party database to make sure everything was entered adequately, but was able to do so efficently and in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of working there was the experience and the continued learning experience."
good,Currently training in the Customer Service Center Department due to my department being outsourced to another state.
good,"I worked at UPS for over 10 years as an operational supervisor. A typical day would include managing a work group to maintain a safe work environment while staying highly productive. I learned a ton of management styles and techniques while working there. I was the best. I earned ""Supervisor of the Year"" honors numerous times. When I applied for promotion, I was held back because upper management wanted to keep me where I was because I was ""running the numbers"" Every day at UPS is physically and mentally demanding. I believe that UPS is designed for turnover to keep a cheap manual work force. Every employee has multiple bosses which can lead to confusion at times."
good,"Everyday was different at UPS, depending on the volume of packages. The work force was a multitude of different personalities. The pay was not all that great and the benefits were the best."
good,I have done every job available inside and out for the last seven and a half years. The amount of work given most days id excessive for most.(thats why you see us running constantly). I was always the fastest driver running routes blind. My biggest issues are no matter how fast you go or how many routes you learn blind or stops you do in a day its never enough or good enough or fast enough. I would like to work for a company who appreciates the full dedication and hard work I give to them. And the sacrifices my family makes for the amount of hours I work.
good,"The UPS Store, franchised, is not owned by UPS, but rather a branch, ( leg if you will) of all that UPS stands for.We represent the integrity and professionalism of the company. I am just getting stagnant, no where to go. I need more."
good,"These stores are franchises so they are all run by different people. I'm positive a job at a different UPS store would have been much better, but it just didn't work out for me at the one I was at."
good,"Interviewed and was selected for a Seasonal Position with UPS.  Very few requirements for entry-level positions so if you're willing to work hard, stay safe and are respectful, UPS would love to hire you!"
good,I’ve learned many things on my own while working here. Many things that i have done have been trial and error and looking for ways to work around the problem. Good place to work if you are in school because of the flexible schedule (depending location)
good,The only draw backs are the hours and the pay advancements and the just benefits  in general. It was almost impossible to clock in more than 26 hours     .
good,"You must be a hard worker to work her; however, you also have to have a strong mind in order to put up with management errors, some lack of staffing, and work hours."
good,The work is very simple. Management could definitely improve. I am simply looking for a part time job while I'm working on my Master's Degree in physical therapy.
good,Working at UPS is a great opportunity for young graduates coming out of college. I recommend working here to all of my friends. Real c-suite visibility.
good,Most of the time when they hire its only for seasonal work they tell everyone there is a chance they will b kept but normally they can you in the end.
good,"Overall amazing experience, colleagues and customers are the best part of the whole experience."
good,UPS is a great company to work for if you can get a permanent position. It's not an easy job. If your hair and nails matter most this is not the job for you. This job will require man power.
good,When I started working at UPS i didn't really like it because of the area i was in. UPS is a fast paced job. We work so hard only to make 200 a week which i hate.
good,"This job is what you make it. If you work hard, you move up in the company. UPS has great benefits and good opportunities for advancement in management or non-management."
good,"A stepping stone to a better career, the people you meet there are all good and it's a great environment being around a group of lads. However, the holidays aren't the best and you must be prepared to sacrifice holidays over the Christmas period and work unsociable hours. There's not much career progression but is suited to a school leaver/college leaver or other young people."
good,"A typical day was aligned with tasks and customer service experience. Also back office tasks such as boxing and preparing shipments for customers. Management needed improvement, since it was family owned it unfortunately had family drama within the company. Overall an average experience."
good,"It’s a good job for the holidays. Once you sign up, they call you and ask if you can work. You say yea and they give you a time and place. You go meet the driver and deliver n scan the packages on their route."
good,"In my time with UPS I seen my fair share of good times and bad times. Peak is super busy and stressful, but the overtime is unlimited at that time. Lot of blood sweat and tears can and will be shed in UPS"
good,Ups is a great place to work.  Managers are good and once you get use to the fast pace you are fine.  Great benifits once you get hired full time.  Lots of hours.
good,Started off as a truck loader took time to learn the basic steps and was able to pick it up smoothly. Good part time job to help get by a little extra money.
good,Everyday I have to verify how many packages are scheduled to be handled and keep statistics to ensure that all packages are received and go out. Very fast paced.
good,Wymagana wysoka odporność na stres. Praca w cieżkich warunkach bez wzgledu na pogodę. Wysoko urazowa jeśli chodzi o zdrowie.
good,"Decent place to work for college or high school students. It is fast paced and most of the positions are at night. If I was you, I would not highly recommend this position for someone with a family or who is heavy in social needs."
good,"The pay it ups is unmatchable for the field. The benefits are amazing, never paid more than a dollar for prescription. It’s just a very stressful work environment with a lot of pressure"
good,"I created amazing friendships with mailbox holders at the store I worked at, and I would see them every day to once a week. Seeing them was the highlight of my day, each person we had our own little thing. At times the store could be empty for a couple hours or I could have a line out the door continuously for hours. The worst, best and hardest part of the job is December. It's the busiest time of the year and sometimes the back of the store we would have so many packages they nearly touched the ceiling and we couldn't reach our restroom or see it. But it's also the greatest time because you get to hear the stories of what people are sending and Tetris skills come in handy when people are sending a lot of stuff and you want the smallest box that fits all the items. You also need to be able to keep a straight face while shipping things... I have shipped some very strange and legal, but very strange things. It can be hard not to laugh or make a face of utter confusion."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS and being able to advance in learning customer service. It was hard work, with a large learning curve, but learning design work and dealing directly with customers was nice."
good,Was in the city then went to feeder position.  Union boards can be tough since you can stay on bottom for awhile. Must be in for the long haul. Management is confused all about the numbers
good,Managers Some where Controlling . The People you are around are very Cool . Sometimes you don’t get help when asked . Part time Supervisiors are petty and will try get you fired if you don’t bow down to them
good,"Lovely job but a lot depends on your co workers and manager. Within one week of working there, I had 7 customers curse out a co worker who was either short with them or mean to them; said co worker also had numerous metal breakdowns over what would be seemingly nothing daily. The literally sat on the computer all day and were short with customers. Having a good work ethic I was my concerned about the drama. I just wanted to work."
good,"Load Truck,Deliver Next Day Air before starting your route. Deliver packages in timely fashion. End of Day pickup from varies clients. Meet with the Next Day Air Truck at a UPS Store so they may collect specific packages to be transported to Oakland Airport. I was trained to be a driver and learned how to driver a UPS truck. Management are political. Pressure. Hardest part of the job, completing your route before returning to the hub. Enjoyable part of the job, overtime pay."
good,Good place to work as part-time. When I was there it was like $10.40. payment has moved up to $15. It is male-dominated. Don't let anyone push you out and treat you horribly. The men will gang up on you especially if you are not talk to them. Still a safe work environment. They take injuries very seriously. Very relaxed work environment fast-paced no drama.
good,You can learn a lot working this job. But they are all small business so they don't pay very well. There are no benefits either. There will never be steady full time. Only when they are short handed.
good,"There is a hierarchy for the supervisors at UPS. If you don't plan to go into management then I would highly recommend working here. However, if you plan to go up through management, then know that you will deal with your fellow co-workers sabotaging you, abusing their seniority and power over you."
good,If you like a fast paced workout all morning long this would be the place to be.  At first the hours were strange but they fit in with my school schedule so well that i wish it had not been temporary holiday postition.
good,Absolutely loved working for UPS. however it was only a temp job and they wouldn't hire me back each year i reapplied. excellent pay and guaranteed overtime
good,Fast Paced environment. Work can be very stressful especially during peak seasonal months leading up to the Christmas holidays. Work is becoming more and more micro-managed as technology increases.
good,"I started as a package handler for the 43rd Street location, the promises for growth throughout the company really gave me hope for what could be my or any potentially worker's future at the company. Though eventually after working incredibly hard and having my time and work being taken advantage of by the management staff and fellow workers, I decided to stop working for them. If you can get along with people you're good, but as soon as you are singled out it's gg."
good,It was Ight manager wasn’t that good showed favoritism and we don’t get paid enough for the work we do. So ups have a lot to work on I mean the drivers get paid good but the warehouse workers where I work don’t get paid good at all.
good,"It could be a phenomenal place to work if your were guaranteed hours. Once you get 70 days, you are guaranteed 3.5 hours which is hardly livable income. Showing up to the hub and getting sent home is enough to make anyone angry, especially when it's happens often enough that you're checks are less than $100. The company culture is fine. The only reason I enjoy this job has been losing weight and some of my co-workers. Other than that, don't expect this to be a fun job or even a secure one. You'll be disappointed."
good,"horas inesperadas en horario, muy lejos de mi casa, medio tiempo."
good,Management is always out to get you do not become friends with any one that works there they will set you up an gain nothing from it it happens every day no one in brown is your friend
good,"A lot of work to do always, must be able to able to learn quickly because there is a lot of data input for shipping and a lot of box sizes to remember"
good,"A typical work day at UPS consisted of me delivering packages to customers doorstep. I gained more customer service experience, with having to interact with them one on one. The hardest part of the job was moving fast to avoid cold weather."
good,Really good pay and benefits.  Zero life balance and upper management micromanages.  Conference calls are daily and usually a waste of time and resources
good,"Would work there again, if the need and timing of the job came about!   The jump seats in the delivery trucks are not the most comfortable to sit in 6-8 hours a day."
good,"Although many workers are well trained and push themselves to fill quota, they still at times get mistreated."
good,"Loading and unloading trucks"
good,Management needs to do better. they are much too concerned with nit-picking with employees over trivial matters. Sorters are treated like work monkeys who do not even deserve to go to the bathroom.
good,"The typical UPS begins with arriving to the facility and asking people how the day went and asking if the upper managers have made any big changes or if anything has been going on that you need to be aware of because work of mouth is the best way to become informed of stuff at the facility I worked."
good,"This is a job. Thats the only way to describe it really. Most people are there only because of the benefits. You dont rewlly work many hours, so you dont bring home much."
good,My experience with Ups was good for a seasonal job. The company has a no phone policy so you have to leave them in your locker.The job is good for who ever is ready for hard work
good,Good place to work out of college...Great place to learn how to multitask and develop customer service skills. The pay is good for entry level if you are just looking to pay a few bills out of college.
good,"This job is strictly for those who can handle the physical demand and willing to work for less than other companies. The employees are great, friendly, hardworking and understanding individuals however the management really needs some work."
good,I loved working for UPS (pay and benefits) Call center environment; not so great at all. My direct managers were awesome though!! They were a big help
good,"Worked in physical and fast-paced position, package handling consisted of continually lifting, lowering and sliding of packages between 25 and 70 lbs. to be placed in UPS trucks for delivery. Labor intensive job where some packages weighed more than 150 lbs. and packages were placed in UPS trucks in numerical order to comply with delivery schedule and numbered for location drop off. Packages were released at residences, private locations and businesses."
good,"I was warned before hiring about the language and culture at UPS. While I am not easily offended, I found a lot of the behavior, including management to be very unprofessional. The job is very fast pace and does not allow for adequate breaks. Overall the job is not bad, I probably would have been a lifer had I started there early, I'm too mature to deal with it now, especially without adequate compensation."
good,Sun up to sun down you keep going until the deliveries are done. It is slow at beginning but once you get in the groove of things it becomes routine especially if you get a route on the regular.
good,"Performing customer service to all retail customers by receiving and processing packages for courier shipment and opeating copiers, fax machines, laminating machines. packing services."
good,"You are down to meet really great customers. Customers with great connections to other wants and needs. The ups store is made to run itself and its not a hard job. What makes it difficult is, poor management and poor training for staff. The work schedule was never set and the pay was not the greatest."
good,"You just never know what they may need packed and shipped, or what kind of printing or office type of assistance they will need help designing. Working with new and regular customer means lots of variety and keeps things interesting."
good,"Job was fast paced. There was a lot to learn."
good,"The culture is the main reason you should work somewhere. If a company does not have a good culture, then you have to ask yourself why am I working here? Well, UPS has a horrible culture and environment, but the money is good. So that is the reason to work there."
good,"Ups no matter if you're a package handler or a semi / delivery driver management is the same."
good,UPS was an alright job it's just the heavy lifting & no protection from the mail bags cutting your hands the work station no matter how hard you wanted to keep it clean you just couldn't.
good,An international bpo company. Catering all the states in United States. The spice are the colleagues that make everyday a fun and interesting working day.
good,"Heavy work, fast paced, thrilling.  Strenuos lifting, focused driving and navigation. Ability to work as directed and provide prompt and courteous service in a timely manner."
good,Not enough hours job was fast pace.  Management was easy to work for which was alright. Team members were good to work with. No benefits at all. Location was hard and complicated to get to. learned how to work in fast paced environment.
good,"UPS - Supply Chain Solutions is a decent enough place to work if there are leads present, which was iffy at best while I was working there. It's very good for new people to the warehouse as the staff is good at training new people. There is very little advancement opportunity for ambitious employees."
good,"Overall, it's an easy, fun job.  At times  (80% of the time) let's just say, if u didnt get your workout in before work,  NO WORRIES. Your workout for the day is your job! There is always something to do.  But most importantly, I  got to meet alot of new people!"
good,"I was only a temporary employee for the holidays. But it was extremely fast paced. Lots of running and squatting. You get really sore. You never really know about the customers you have to bring packages to, because some of them are crazy."
good,"I worked here for 8 plus years in the late 80's and early 90's. There were great benefits and pay, but the culture of management vs union employees was not a fun one to work in."
good,I liked the work. And some of the co workers. In most cases hard to get a full time job. people stay part time for many years. The best thing about it is they pay for your college. which you would only want a part time job with college.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for and gives great opportunity and focus much on its mission and vision statement, however the company management team on the floor level and some staff level have a disconnect on how to treat employees and only promotes based on subjective objectives rather than going through the talent pool. I love the company i work for, however the management team will make it stressful without reason. UPS is a great company too work for just know that Work Life Balance is only a thought depending on the position"
good,"Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assists executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, scheduling meetings, and restocking supplies."
good,"Can't get anyone to tell me about my benefits available to me. And I got hired at the Granbury, Tx center 2yrs ago, I am a F/T Pkg Car driver n I have to drive my OWN Vehicle n pay all MY OWN GAS to n from my route 2HRS away EVERYDAY. $200 a week in gas n wear n tear on my own truck, not to mention 4 hrs a day of free driving time just getting to my route....... So Wrong, yet everyone says theres nothing I can do about that, WHY is that???? How CAN THAT BE RIGHT??? If I get in an accident to or from my route in my own car in that on UPS, they should be leasing my vehicle, paying my gas n ME..... Can anyone answer my questions???"
good,"Personally, I went to work at UPS during the Christmas season.  I never intended to stay.  The work environment and upward mobility were not for me.  My educational and work experience were better suited for management."
good,It's very stressful considering the circumstances.  It requires a lot of time so there's not really much of a work/life balance.  It's quite a challenge.
good,"Parked myself here for a couple years while working with their management to perform both technical and  sales on a local and national basis.  Compensation was based on actual performance, and that was a GOOD thing."
good,not many hours....high stress from bosses that comes from above...expect people to work like machines and sometimes speak to you as one ....always hurry ..hurry...if you can deal with that...job is for you ...great 4 hr. workout ...
good,"It was a long time ago, but my typical work day started around 9:30 pm and would run until around 2 am. Most days were extremely fast pace with very little margin of error. Once my one year contract was up I left to pursue something with better work hours."
good,"As an operations supervisor the job was the most stressful job I've ever had but it was also the most fulfilling jobs I've ever had. Basically when things went good, it was good. When things went bad, it was bad. The atmosphere overall was okay. Most people got along well but there was definitely a few union snakes that brought down the overall morale. I didn't mind the union, I just call them union snakes because there were always a couple individuals that the thought the words ""protected by the union"" meant ""I'm going to see how lazy I can possibly be and then grieve my supervisor when they are forced to pick up my slack."""
good,For the most part working at ups was very fun its was great workout and I met people from all over the state.it wasn't hard getting adjusted to the job
good,"fast paced, demanding job, union job"
good,"The work environment was great for the most part.  The only unfortunate circumstance is when there is the ""observational management philosophy""  Managers were encouraged to keep their hands clean.  I was of course in the south where the precedence of a overseer sipping sweet tea with lemon while all of the field workers died of thirst was a reoccuring theme.  Can't say if this is the same philosophy spread through out the company.  Just the location I was in perhaps (shrugs shoulders)."
good,"UPS is a great place to work, especially if you are trying to gain experience. I love my position, although the pay rate is low, and you get capped off at your hours. I also got moved to working over nights without a notice."
good,"I liked it but training wasn't good.  I had to learn more then expected, like getting into systems with p/w's and I didn't get to that point and it was frustrating to me."
good,"Very stressful, demanding, but rewarding...at times.  Excellent people who work hard and work hard to achieve daily objectives with little coaching or praise from upper management."
good,"UPS is not a job for everyone. If you make a career here, you must go the route of full time management or become a full time driver. Otherwise, you will be forced to work a second job for lack of hours (unless you're a student or don’t need the money)."
good,"In a typical day of work, I am called in and required to wait for the driver to start his route (waiting at the station is unpaid)  I would not start getting paid until after the first delivery is paid. This particular station was in McAlester, OK and I went on the Coalgate route, a rough hour and a half drive, Unpaid.  You're allowed to work 6 hours, no OT pay whatsoever. You do the heavy work, You take the packages to the door, you are the worker, the Driver will drive."
good,It is a position where you need to have the perseverance to learn and definite drive with the ability to be tough skinned and patients. Must be a people person.
good,Working for the United Parcel Service was a very inspiring moment in my life. I was responsible for multiple responsibilities and being one of very few females to work as many hours as the males did and work as hard and dedicated as the males did I learned so much while being there.
good,"This business is a family run business. Although unlikely that youll be able to snag a job here, it is a face paced multi faceted job with a broad range of duties."
good,"I was a seasonal employee, and worked full-time.  A typical day was from 8:30am - 7pm.  It was an exhausting job that left almost no time for yourself except for your 2 days off."
good,"Nice company,but lot of work is to be done.their is lot of partiallity between contracter and a fulltime worker. but overall it is good."
good,ups is a great job it helps you have a healthy life style but the work hours are very odd and can get in the way of any thing you try todo during the day you work either overnight until morning or in the middle of the day until late at night it makes it very hard to spend family time have a social life or even some times gets in the way of school
good,No room for advancement within the company.  I worked for The UPS Store not corporate UPS.  Managment/ownership was poor due to not enough employees.  No coverage
good,This was a job that was helpful to me and I also was helpful to the company. Co-workers were very nice. It was a typical climb the ladder atmosphere but it was still a good place to work.
good,"I learned zip codes in different areas in different cities. I learned the programs very quickly to get those I did not know."
good,"Do your job and everything will be ok,i like moving around and meeting new people. It's great the management is on top of the game! But stick to your job description and you cant go wrong."
good,"Expedited the route movement of incoming and outgoing aircraft cargo and freight. Aircarft: UPS Boeing B757-200 Freighter and UPS Boeing A300-600 Freighter"
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my time there. They expect a lot from you really quick. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, just slightly unexpected. Within 2 20 hour weeks they want you to be like everyone that’s been there longer than you. Which can be tough for many people."
good,"You can ask for days off and they will talk with you then give you a feedback. More encouragement is given to the employee to work more. You can talk with friends as you work, if you are a ""catty type"""
good,"Hardest part of my job is dealing with attitudes of employees. What i have learned is to come into work with a positive mindset. Stay focused. Being in management has helped me see things in a different perspective, but I am a worker. I don't like to see things or at risk behaviors and just tell employees about it i want to show them how to do it the right way. Most enjoyable part of my job is training someone who is willing to listen, learn and work actually succeed in the job. Our workplace culture is very fast paced, get in get out ordeal have some pride in your work. Love the people i work with in management just wish for better job advancement. Being in management the only way to further my career is thru management, my expectations are to leave management and make it in the delivery driver side of the company. Waiting to find out if it happens at the beginning of next year, if it doesn't i will be looking for new employment opportunities."
good,A typical day at work is about 10 hours of continuous delivery and  pick-up of packages .Management  are not very supportive . Work place culture is stressful . The hardest part of the job is the physical demands that is placed on your body to get the job done . The most enjoyable part of the job is not being  inside an office and having the freedom of being outside .
good,it was a fun place to work and kept you busy but it didn’t have enough hours to give. there was a lot to do in 2 hours but that wasn’t going to get me very far.
good,"Honestly it is a great job with room for advancements/Benefits. management could be better, a lot of stressful physical work with a 10 min break. Very unsafe environment. Not a job a recommended for students with early classes"
good,"I worked for a UPS, SCS (supply chain solutions). It was a decent place. They gave FMLA leave (unpaid) for birth of my child. They only downside was occasional safety issues with moving heavy boxes."
good,"UPS is a decent place to work for, just be prepared to be faced with sometimes poor management. Your co-workers will be nice, but management will often try to get the impossible out of you just to meet thier numbers. Perfect job is you don't mind doing some hard work at a fast pace and are looking for something part-time."
good,"Walked the yard checking trailers if they had a load or were empty,  Checked the yard for tractors that were on the property and dollies that are on property."
good,The Operations Manager position was an opportunity to learn how to become a successful business owner.  The responsibility of managing a facility required you to wear many hats. I had to make sure that we were OSHA and TSA compliant.  I utilized 3rd party labor and transportation vendors to run my business.
good,"Typical day requires constant attention to the operation identifying issues and solving problems in a varity of arenas.  "
good,No opportunity for advancement within the company. Managers do not listen to better ways to try and solve problems or solutions. Pay is ok but cant wait 10 years to drive a UPS truck.
good,A typical day at work consisted of delivering packages to homes and businesses on a designated route. Workplace culture difficult due to inherent issues between management and union.
good,haven't been there long enough to tell you what i think. so far i think management is very unorganized on telling me what my actual job duties will consist of.
good,It's a decent place to work but it takes a long time to get a full time position and stable hours.  To be a driver the school process is pretty intense.
good,"I think this job isn't for people who like to have a social life. The job is quite well payed for what you do. Also, be prepared to work hard when doing this job sometimes they push you quite hard and it can challenge your body."
good,"I performed supervisory role with part time status paying salary.  The pay was for 32 hours per week.  The conditions at the hub where packages were constantly moving, a typical week was over 40 hours.  "
good,"I worked at a UPS Store in central Alabama. I was paid minimum wage but was required to do the same work as people making more than twice my salary. Being in a store with such a small team meant that the owner who happened to be in the same store as I worked felt very comfortable with talking to employees in less than professional manner. This included scoldings, expressing anger and frustration through finger pointing and yelling, and doing so in front of the whole team. I will never work in an independent owner environment again. Based on this experience independent owners hold to much power and control over their employees which leads to a feeling of superiority that leads to demeaning behavior."
good,"they always tell me the job is changing and that is so true."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, great co workers, fun environment with coworkers and customers alike. No benefits, even for full time employees, not much room for advancement or pay increases. Absent ownership and frantic management."
good,"Good people to work with, not the best company to work for. On the plus side, preload makes time and a half afterm 5 hours on shift. Other than that not my first recommendation"
good,je fais le shift 03h-09h et tout se passe assez bien.les équipes sont super coordonnées et l ambiance est harmonieuse .plan de carriere envieux avec des contrats durables
good,Job is not as physical as they say it is when you sign up but they work you as much as they can get out of you and then if your performance varies at all they get rid of you before you become a full time employee
good,"Very difficult to make changes within a multi-billion dollar company.  Unfortunate for this company, it developed itself into a very diligent and plateau type of work atmosphere."
good,"working at this fast moving company ,,has many good sides ,,education and saving plans and many good people to work with..the policies and work style of the company are very good"
good,Never praised for your work even when staying to finish after you should have finished. Staff were spoken to as if they didn't matter. What ever you did it was never enough.
good,"Great pay and great benefits. Seniority has precedence over the work load. If there is not enough work, your route will be given to more senior drivers."
good,"Physical work"
good,Ist ein.tolles unternehhmen nette menschen. Ejnfach toll
good,Terrible management. Too much favoritism and alternative truths around there. They micromanage the person's behavior more than their 'friends' work. My stay there was miserable.
good,it was seasonal job really didn't do a lot except trucks unload and load. we did about usually about 8-12 trucks in a night of maybe 7-8 hours.
good,"Fun place to work in, with some interesting people. Yet, unlike my first experience with the hub, many things have personally to me, changed which, I personally no longer feel comfortable with. This includes, attitude of co-workers to work &, without any attempt on the part of the supervisors to critically look into and stop/change. "
good,"UPS gave me the opportunity to work a night shift doing strenuous package handling work."
good,"UPS pays pretty well, but expects a tremendous commitment from its management people. I cannot imagine a work environment that would be tougher than UPS."
good,Multiple store locations with no formal training. Over demanding with no real schedule adherence. Inconsistent scheduling methods with heavy fluctuations.
good,"A typical day at work is going into the office with mind to work hard and get results.  Saving the company money and creating revenue is the primary objective. I've learned that, management is not about telling others what to do, but about motivating that individual to accomplish their duties at work.  My co-workers are hard working and committed to the vision of the company.  We all work together as a team to accomplish this every day, we are hear at work.   The hardest part was creating those ideas and getting the target audience to appeal to us. We maintain a"
good,"It's a good job for the most part. Good pay and great benefits, but management leaves a lot to be desired. It's a good short-term job."
good,Working as a lead supervisor I am required to train new employees and ensure they are completing the day to day task required.
good,"UPS has been a good place to work.  I have had opportunities to grow and move up."
good,i worked for ups for 32 years and retired. i would not recommend this company to anybody.long hours and harassing management.
good,"UPS is very competitive and preaches the advantages of the future."
good,"The benefits are great, but the union ultimately runs things. You can truly make a career out of working for UPS, as evidenced by the thousands of people who have walked through their doors for decades. I just didn't like the unsteady hours. Overall it was a great experience."
good,"Overall, probably the best job a college student can have. Working as a third shift package handler will pay for 100% of your in-state college tuition through the metro-college plan (to my knowledge, Louisville, Ky only). The management is inconsistent and your entire job can drastically change at the drop of a hat for no reason whatsoever. The union provides a decent level of security, though. Overall a decent job with good benefits."
good,A typical day at work consist of long and short trucks sometimes hot sometimes cold. While working at UPS I learned that I shouldn't talk to everyone as if their my friend and to keep it strictly business while employed there. The management is ok in my opinion. My co-workers are ok but sometimes can be a bit much. The hardest part of the job would be lifting the hardware boxes. The most enjoyable part would be clocking out and walking back to the car lol.
good,Good job overall. Management always against the workers due to the union. You can stay in shape loading these trucks and convenient hours for an extra income job.
good,Driver was very friendly and informative as to how to get the job done. Made each day go by quick. If it wasn't for my hours and compensation would have loved to stay.
good,I had a great time working for Ups in 2014. I had a problem in 2015 when I had to take a day off for my kid and lost my job over it.
good,"I enjoyed the co workers, managers and the job in general.   It was fun getting to know our regular customers as well. Having my store located in Hawaii was a plus as well."
good,"Working for ups on a typical day is fast paced,cold on given days but such a learning environment. Customer friendly atmosphere. I learned from working with them the major role a postal employee play such major roles and are looked upon highly in the community. The hardest part of the job would be working in inclement weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the gratitude the customer have towards you and the respect they have for you."
good,My time so far has been productive. We deliver packages to multiple neighborhoods and apartment complexes. We also pick up from local merchants within our designated area. Though the position is seasonal I will probably seek longer termed employment.
good,"An enjoyable place to work. The staff were fun and hard working."
good,I was proud of the job I did when working for UPS. Management cares more about their numbers than their people who do the work for them.
good,"Great Place To Work At, Fast Pace But Fun With Some Downtime."
good,"fun work environment but long hours"
good,"If you can imagine yourself waking up at four o' clock every morning to load three package cars with packages weighing in between 1-175lbs Monday thru Friday with only a ten minute break, then picture yourself at UPS. Everyday is a typical day. Our typical day means we sweat nonstop carrying packages from off of the belt into the package car. Most of my packages weigh in between 40-90 pounds. my coworkers are just as tired as I am. we cant wait until break time so that we can drink something nice and cold. The hardest part is keeping up with the moving belt filled with packages. You learn self control mentally because without the right mindset, it's physically impossible for you to do the job the correct way. Management is very rough, and the most enjoyable time we all have, is leaving to go home."
good,"Just as it sounds. Move boxes and get the job done. Not a lot of professionalism. Just work. Great for a part time job and will take away from your gym time."
good,The most enjoyable part of the given day is see the customer smiles knowing you just delivered their expected package that they ordered. Something they ordered for themselves or there children it always brings a smile to their face when you arrive at their door.
good,"Very results oriented company. A company that desires the best of their employees and strives to make every employee the very best in the industry. Excellent benefit package, probably the best around. Overall a great place to work and a great place to better yourself."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading/loading trucks."
good,"Took pictures of our neighborhoods with camera's, gave presentations on problems in local neighborhoods and our own."
good,I was not cut out for this particular job. You must get up in the middle of the night and load boxes for five hours. I was not in shape for this type of work but when I left I was. The people that worked with were amazing and helpful. I would have not lasted as long as I did with out them. Ten years later I still have contact with some of them.
good,"Great experienced working in a UPS, people there are awesome, they are very nice which is helped me to became a good communicator more, and improved my customer service skills."
good,I enjoyed my time at ups. I opened trailers and dispatched trailers in and out of our property. I would have to work in any weather situation in order to check our property for missed packages.
good,unload delivery trucks as they come back to the factory/warehouse. put boxes and whatever else was in the delivery trucks onto the conveyer belt to be loaded onto the tractor trailers to be taken to the next location. wash delivery trucks if need be. individual work hardly any contact with management
good,"i mostly worked on goods in, if not i was packing "
good,I am a very productive person and I am also a very quick learner and can multitask... My job security was not secured.  I am a very outgoing person and helped others learn some computer skills.  I assisted in all that I can produce for others.
good,This job was a good experience for me because it was something I never encountered. Taught me a lot of things that I will use in the rest of my career.
good,Worked at night shift.  Drivers and office & hub people were very nice and enjoyed working with them but did not have much opportunities available for advancement.
good,work start hours changed every day and there was no set time to get off when ever we got done witch was fine for the first 5 hours you got pay the base 10.50 an hour then anything after that I got paid 15.75 witch was great
good,If you have a passion for logistics UPS might be the job for you.
good,"Great place to work, and great people to work with. During the holiday season things can get a little crazy, people are constantly in and out. But its a great place to learn the business, and get experience. The hardest part about this job is doing the same thing day in and day out."
good,Working on the line could be quite challenging in this very fast paced environment.
good,"Arrive at 7:00 am, adjust and make successful plan, implement the plan.  Train and hold people accountable, follow up with daily activities.  Ensure everything is completed correctly and daily as well and time cards are properly completed."
good,Nice environment. I enjoyed working with the people there. I worked in the suspense error department. The co-workers demonstrated teamwork. Good work schedule.
good,Lots of pros and cons. Will leave the rest for a face to face conversation
good,"A typical day at work is takeing care of my customers shipping needs,up selling like stamps,printing,faxing,takeing phone calls,counting done tills.from 3pm till 7pm i work by self."
good,"* Never leave a package behind"
good,on a même pas une pause que sauf si ça arrange la hiérarchie alors qu'ils savent bien qu'en faisant 7 heures de boulot d'affilé on a droit à une pause d'aux moins 30mn
good,"I am a contractor , so I can not say much now . But all in all a good place to work for."
good,"My job entitled me to helping the UPS truck driver in delivering the packages to residential neighborhoods, apartment complexes, and place of businesses as well. I would sit beside the truck driver until he makes a stop and tells me where to drop the package or packages off. Also taught me how to work the board in which scans the packages and tells me whether I can drop it off or if it is signature required. We had to work very diligently and at a very fast pace in order to deliver the two hundred or so packages by the end of the day"
good,"Loaded products weighing up to 75 pounds on and off conveyor belts"
good,I thought this was a good job and would do it again. Even though it was seasonal. Just didn't like the lost checks every time I went to pick up my check.
good,"Great benefits and reasonable hours for college students or part-time work on the side. You learn a lot they swing you everywhere when you are a great worker. But the sad part about it, know matter how hard you work they will not give you a raise. They are more focus on finding fault in what you do. Its a fast pace work environment, the co- workers are sometime cool. People come and go there, you get a raise every six months. Managers are A-holes; they sleep around with one another, the male managers come on to the females very strongly. It is against the company policy for them to date the co-workers but they do it anyway, which it causes people to not get the position they want to apply for because of the favoritism. The most enjoyable part of the day is going home. The hardest part of the day is dealing with slow workers, overbearing Management yelling at you as if you are a child."
good,Modo generico de  la tipica empresa  que recien empieza con un esquema de marketing  sencillo
good,My time at UPS was a good one. My supervisors were great people person and they treated everyone fairly and with respect.
good,"A typical day at work would be very time consuming and very fast paced, but I loved it. I enjoy being in that kind of enviornment. I loved meeting the new people every day and making sure they had a wonderful enough experience so that they would continue using our services and give refferals. everyday was challenging dueto everything being so time consumed which felt a bit overwhelming at times but it still got done neatly."
good,"Pleasant environment, early but short hours. Management pushes you for excellence. you will lose weight ."
good,Sample job. Load and unload trucks and sort packages and scan items as you go.
good,"I was the person to open the store. I would open the gates make sure everything was in its place make sure everything was clean. Turn computer systems on. Put registers in. Fill humidifier. Check inventory. Order supplies if needed. Print reports. Make phone calls to mailbox holders to get them to pay or notify them that they are late on payment. Do unable to forward mail (Mail that cannot be forwarded, but are not mailbox holders any longer). Send certified letters to mailbox holders that are about to be closed boxes. Clean, clean, and clean some more. All while helping customers that are coming in to ship, or pack and ship their items, fax, copy, scan, or get notary. "
good,Very good company to work for. Most days I worked on a assembly line and production. Preparing pakages for shipment and inventory count at the end of day. Employees were always friendly and happy.
good,Worked with many different people on a daily basic. I learned how to work with aggravated customers while staying calm myself.
good,"el ambiente de trabajo era estresante, los supervisores siempre están cuestionando tu trabajo."
good,"I still feel a little twinge (7 years later) when I see a UPS logo. I wanted to stay forever, but there were 2 problems - both involving leadership."
good,The business is under new management now with new employees. The ones I worked under were wonderful.
good,- It has been nice to learn a little more each year.
good,"The moment you get in the truck your time starts, making stops at almost every home and business with anywhere from one to twelve packages. Learned to organize in other ways, how to be quick and safe. The only difficulty of the job was the weather, and it was also the most joyful thing."
good,"UPS Supply Chain Solutions handles warehousing, inventory, picking, and shipping to various customers. My day is usually spent printing and verify orders,auditing, and securing carriers for shipments."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but good luck on moving up in the company."
good,"Since Im on call through the holidays I have no steady income from UPS. I've learned a lot from this company; to be productive, resposnible safe and friendly. Managment could be better as far as handling certain issues invovling customers but since I've been layed off I wouldn't know how it works now. The hardest part of the job is the type of freight that they get, somtimes its an increased amount with 100 lbs + of boxes with liitle to no help from co-workers.The most enjoyable part is the money that I get on a good week of work, however its not consistant."
good,"I have worked for UPS twice. Once in Anaheim, CA working with customers who needed to mail their packages at Christmastime, and this second time was the Cerritos, CA facility through Spherion Staffing in Cypress, CA. The Anaheim facility it was a direct hire."
good,"This is a seasonal job so you shouldn't look into move in permanent,lots of walking"
good,"Loading Trucks, Shipping, Very demanding job, once you made mgnt. position."
good,"temp job through ct skills very easy, assisting driver with unloading and transporting packages. signing off and scanning boxes ensuring everything is accounted for."
good,"I was working at the Denton location for shipping in the receiving Freight Department and although it was extremely temporary I did enjoy my job with UPS. IT was challenging and supportive team there. Leadership was strong and kept the team motivated. However the job was only for the November to early January time frame to assist for holidays. Most of there employees were drivers 80-90% of the temporary working had to leave after this period and the vast majority of these hard workers became part time drivers. I would definitely consider a full time employment in the future by UPS. My only hesitation or negative would be there are very few full time positions open in this comp[anies entry level jobs in the DFW area. My next door neighbor is a HUB manager in Madison, Wisconsin. I hear and haven't seen any complaints from the college degree required employment. Unfortunately they have very little in employment for non-college degree positions."
good,"I've been a seasonal UPS driver for 3 peak seasons. I'm an excellent motor vehicle driver with a large variety of specialized training. I really enjoy being outside and active. UPS provides me the opportunity to get paid nicely for doing things I enjoy. However, it's not all sunshine and happiness. This job is hard on the body; there is no company paid rehab when you no longer are employed! Landing a full-time job with UPS (even outside of the driver role) is seemingly impossible for me. I'm continuing to try though."
good,I had really great co-workers and costumers. I really liked the hours. I had a very nice manger who had taught me a lot about the job. It's was a comfortable environment.
good,The job was demanding but what job isn't Upper management was terrible it's all about them employees and supervisors  work hard. Good benefits and good pay
good,"The best part were satisfying customers , my hardest would be in the cold delivering packages it should be a limit on who goes to deliver a package per stop ."
good,"Work is good."
good,"hardest part of job is the long hours away from family"
good,It’s was a hard working n steady job. I enjoy delivering people things cause they need it most importantly. I love to see the smiles on their faces when they get their packages.
good,"It was an honor, to work for a well-known company. I got sense of pride working for the company. But I the pay wasn't what I expected and I needed something more secure."
good,"Depending which division of UPS you work, you will either love or hate the work culture. The only true work culture is in the small package division, which also pays the most. A college degree is not mandatory for advancement, however it is almost a guaranteed opportunity to advance since there is a shortage of employees that have degrees and UPS likes to promote from within."
good,In the warehouse your going to always work hard for your check but the benefits are great when u actually get to them because you have to hang tight to get the benefits
good,Loved working for ups but they dont offer advancement. I worked the seasonal position so i was only their for 2 months and was really looking forward to getting hired full time but they didnt give me the option so i was very upset about that because i loved working for them
good,"The only reason I'm not currently there is due to a car crash. Now I'm trying to get back on my feet. I just loaded and organized trucks. First you grab from your specific bin, scan the package, mark it and put it in corresponding place on truck"
good,Recommend hire more help work is very hard on the human body could offer employees more hours or extra shifts instead of having things so strict and set
good,Good atmosphere and the management is good. They should have more benefits and better salary. The reason why ppl is leaving is for lack of benefits on the job
good,"A typical is day is unloading package cars, sorting the packages by destination and loading the packages into various trailers all while waiting for drivers to return to the building and trying to meet production requirements."
good,"One week I would have 10 hours, the next week 50 hours. I wanted at least 35 hours/week. Scheduling was unpredictable and management lacked vision and communication. "
good,"This job was fun while it lasted and I am looking for a job similar, so at all anything that is physically intense. I had to be very punctual and it helped when I wasn’t too punctual to become on time"
good,"Very fast paced and can be stressful but overall a good company to work for. Peak season is extremely busy and hectic but the extra hours and overtime paid for anything over 8 hours daily, definitely makes it worth it"
good,"Very hard working environment, understaffing and poor management led to many hard days and blame was pushed off onto others. Made working there very difficult."
good,It was a good temporary job for the winter i worked. Just so I could have some money since I couldn’t do any of my side jobs. All the guys I rode with were super cool
good,UPS is a good company. The job was only seasonal. Would be a good place to get a permanent full-time job. Would work for UPS in the future in a different position.
good,For a seasonal job during the holidays I had a good experience overall. I would meet my driver at a certain location and do a ride a long and help deliver packages.
good,Ups overall was a good company to work for however I had another child after 19 years and had to work different schedule to meet my needs the people were very friendly nice environment
good,Overall the job was pretty easy it was kind of fun to drive around delivering packages could have been paid more but it was just temporary job going for full-time employment with the company though
good,I worked as a driver helper. Meaning i worked on the truck but i just ran packages to the door so the driver could keep things moving. Since there are so many packages for holiday deliverys
good,"Dos meses, sustituta en ruta. Trabajo rutinario y fácil, todo el día en el coche. Se me da bien conectar con los clientes."
good,"Before you read this remember all The UPS Stores are franchises and your experience is different based on which location you work at. I have worked under three different owners, this is about my most recent owner. "
good,"Ups is a very hard job, I worked there in the summer and all we would get is a 10 minute break and we work work for 7+ hours. It is not climate controlled and I was getting payed low for what I was doing."
good,was a good job for temporary seasonal to work while waiting for a full time job- hard long days i don't have anything more to say was a good temporary
good,"This job required me to be in top shape because I was in and out of the truck delivering packages that could way from 1 lb to 150 lbs. Furthermore, all packages had to be safely delivered in a timely manner."
good,"Great company to work for, but not flexible with schedule. I wouldn't recommend being a driver helper if you have small children, especially if you don't have someone to watch them after school hours."
good,"A hard working fast paced quick thinking on your feet. alot of ground to cover daily sweating. Strong culture of long term employees, family like atmosphere. Seniority rules. weekly pay. 3rd shift hours. no tolerance attendance policy."
good,"Great place to work, but you will remain part time for numerous years before ever becoming full time.  I enjoyed working at UPS, but needed more hours and more pay.  I would recommend UPS as a starter job and if you have the time and can deal with the pay, then stay until you become full time; which will be years."
good,Extremely fast paced job.  Must be willing to work if applying here.  Managers are horrible and the new remodel is a train wreck.   But the overall compensation and benefit package is amazing
good,Its very relaxed and can work with your schedule for school and work. You get to meet a lot of interesting people from your community and around the country.
good,"Its a good company but I wish they would give more opportunity to those that need the income.  Need proper training, need to communicate better with employees."
good,"Senior Management is clueless."
good,"the don't take care of there best loyal employees, they push their employees so hard especially during  peak season. very little reward for not such a good payout"
good,I currently work for this company and to date I do not have negative remarks about the company. I would say that it is a part time job just as they advertise
good,If you are an unloaded you will work your butt off. Don’t push yourself to hard and be safe. There is no point in hurting yourself do your best and remember safety first.
good,I felt like a seat shop. Very fast paced. My day consists of constructing packages in a truck securely so they dont break during transport. The cuture is quiet. The hardest part is working the the heat.
good,Very productive place to work if you have a second job. Job must co-inside with Ups. There are not enough hours at UPS. and sometime the supervisors are rude.
good,Not a place for a career Ok as a second job. would not recommend to anyone looking for full time employment Work was stress free and there was no breaks.
good,They lie about the pay and don't care about the employees. If you don't do anything they ask you outside of your assignments they want to fire you and tell you that they can send you to another department. They mess up your paycheck and never fix it. It's true everyone there is either selfish or lazy.
good,"This was a good job and I enjoyed working with the driver. If they could make the position full time, they would have a lot of people trying to work for them."
good,I had alot of fun working there both years as a seasonal driver helper I just wish I could have found something more permanent. It was a 2 month seasonal job unfortunately
good,"A typical day at the UPS Store includes receiving drop off packages, shipping and packing, mailbox services, printing, faxing, copying, and cleaning the store. The hours are very flexible, although the whole reason for me looking for a second job is that I am not getting the hours I wish to receive. That may depend on location as well."
good,"UPS is a machine.  With written process manuals and extensive daily training exercises and expectations.  They provide a platform for success to thrive with constant over site and measurement.  To that end, this is not very rewarding work.  At the end of the day or night your body is physically tired and a long term goal would be to move up in the company.  Mentally the work is repetitive and mundane after a few years.  Turn over was the largest obstacle to over come."
good,It is fun working at UPS The job is a temporary contract until I go permanent but besides that the people are nice and seem to care about each other. The work is steady but not impossible. I enjoy working here
good,Working at ups was a experience because it showed me that you have to work together to get the job done. I focused more on getting there than being involved in the rules and regulations. So I don't think I would have passed the safety test
good,"I learned a lot about working in a corporate environment. Being an intern I felt like there was no place for me. For new interns I would recommend getting in, fulfilling the contract, and getting out."
good,It a jobs in which you work at a fast pace so you have to keep up with yor coworkers but you be part time for along time and advancement will take a while
good,Union help with raises and job security and just have to be able to work at a fast pace and if u really like working fast and a daily work out this is the job for u
good,I would meet my driver at a gas station. Then we would leave do deliverys and then at the end of the day we had pick-ups. After the pick-ups are done i would then be driven back to my car and go home.
good,"Different walks of life come in the store, celebs etc."
good,"Workplace culture is lacking, somewhat of a retirement home but that is changing with the new factory model. Introduction of the factory model seems to have built more walls than it took down. The atmosphere has more buzz but I wouldn't agree that productivity is better."
good,"it was always really cold and the management favorited some of the better workers. I was constantly doing the same thing everyday so it wasn't the worst , I learned a lot they don't really teach you, you kind of learn alone ."
good,The job was okay I was only there for a few months because it was a seasonal job but I was doing fine there no really complaints I just felt like I needed to be somewhere else
good,Once you leave the orientation and make your way to an area you will most likely find yourself alone. They take you to an area show you the trucks tell you a few things give you a marker and leave you to figure it out. Or they just throw you in a truck and tell you to unload. The supervisors are young and can barely do the job themselves. There are alot of good workers and supervisors too. It just depends on where you get placed. Its the luck of the draw.
good,A very fast paced work environment where you handle packages ranging from 1# to 150 # without mechanical assistance. Load 3 to 4 package cars by taking the packages from a moving conveyor to the truck where they are all loaded in a specific order. Requires speed and rigid standards for accuracy.
good,UPS is a good place to work for someone who wants to stay in shape and/or wants to get in shape while get paid. Unloading trucks can get boring but usually the coworks keep time flying. Working at UPS is a great experience and wonderful place that has opportunities to further your career. But working at UPS takes alot of motivation and self care. and the breaks are short
good,The hourly pay at UPS is great and the hiring process is very easy and simple. The work day goes by quickly due to its fast pace which means you are always busy. All the employees there are very friendly and are very willing to help.
good,"very fast pace"
good,"You have to be able to work fast, stay motivated and be prepared to stand for hours. We usually get 2 breaks if working a full 8 hours. One break if we work for around 6 hours."
good,A typical day was fast paced and detail orientated.  I unloaded tractors and reloaded packages according to areas of delivery with holiday packages. The best part of the job was the people I worked with because we all worked together as a team to accomplish the job.
good,UPS has its limitation in retaining talent in management.  Typically you work 10 to 12 hours a day.  The culture of being a team is non existent.     Thinking outside the box has its limitations due to putting the wrong people in place to manage certain areas of operations.
good,The hardest part of the job is actually planning when to take your breaks and your lunch.....The most enjoyable part of the job is when its time to go home...............
good,It just great to come to work everyday and chat with the other staff. Good connections with people you can joke around with and still work at your own pace.
good,Depending on who you are where you want to go will depend on how you will rate UPS. They have opportunities and room for growth for everyone you just have to be dedicated to your job and learn what the mission is really about. Due to it being part-time for most starting employees can have a negative affect on people and also having a low compensation amount for employees. But they offer a benefits package that pays and cover all your medical needs which is cool. I believe your attitude will make your career at UPS.
good,"Boss man is rude and sexist. He picks favorites and is a liar. I was hired under false pretenses. Pay was awful, and only got 15 minute lunches. Other than boss man, the job was ok."
good,responsible for sorting packages in the correct mail slot. very fast paced and must pay attention to detail so that the correct package is mailed to the correct recipients. The ability to train on different aspects of how mail is coded and received.
good,"Being a driver helper was mostly walking to and from truck delivering packages. If the driver and time permits, sorting packages in the back breaks up the exercise, speeds things up later on, and gives your mind something to do."
good,"I like the environment at UPS. The work is not too difficult, but working night shift can be pretty tough on sleep. Especially when you have to have more than 1 job in order to stay above water."
good,"Great peak season job, felt like I was just hitting my stride there and they told us they didn't need anyone anymore.  8 hours of helping people track packages on the computer and phone.  The training was a lot in a very short period time. a lot of us felt like we weren't trained properly."
good,A typical day is sometimes long and exhausting and usually really hot or extremely cold working in the trucks. I learned nothing except that taking my time doing a quality job is better than running around trying to do everyone else's job in a frantic manner. The workplace is kind of depressing which is the common opinion and is part of the hardest part of working there. The best part is doing a quick four to five hours and leaving.
good,"Working for UPS was a great experience for me. I learned a lot more  what it takes to bring satisfaction to our customers. There is a lot of walking and climbing steps to make a delivery, as well as being out in all types of weather, if that does not bother you then the job is for you. The only thing that bothered me was that the company does not care about a lot of the seasonal workers or new drivers. They tell them if they drive 40 days in a 70 day period they will make book and join the union. Most of that is true, but from what I saw they did set up a lot of new drivers up for failure, only because they did not give them a UPS truck they gave them a Budget rent a truck with no shelves and when the driver came in all the packages were just thrown in. Where I really felt bad for these new drivers is even if they did organize the truck there is not much time, because time is of an essence. Also even if they also organized the truck they do not have shelves, everything is on the floor so when a driver makes a turn everything goes all over the place. Most of the time they did not give them a helper. However my experience was awesome, I had a great driver that I worked with, we were on the same page and we were very productive together."
good,"Would have stayed with company had I gotten hours after the holidays. "
good,"Typical day is frantic, erratic and energetic. Always started with a meeting and safety tip of the day depending on the season. Management was close to good , a few ruined it for the ones that were great. Hours were long but Overtime pay was great ,vacation was superb!!"
good,We had to load trucks up from the back to the front. Depending on where you were placed determined how fast you had to move. Management would help sometimes. The hardest part was when it was getting close to getting off and you've been moving nonstop for hours it took a push to keep the momentum going. The most enjoyable part was that it was a daily workout so I didnt need to go to the gym afterwards
good,I was fired 2 days before a full release -because I had a small stroke. I worked at a UPS store. I loved my job but the owner was very demanding and paid very little attention to our store
good,"Okay to have this job but you would need a extra income to work here. Not a easy job. Very hard if you are a woman. Not bad money to work for , not a bad place to work."
good,This is an ok place to work.  They have plenty of work for those that get hired.  You will not get sleepy or have any downtime.  The people you work with are very interesting.
good,"Working at UPS, one will have to be competitive, aggressive, self motivated and be able to work in a fast pace, adaptable and safe working environment. Planes arrive at a scheduled time and needs to pushed back at a scheduled time. So, in between is crunch time. This is the most critical, where everyone is focused on their assigned positions, while working as one unit. There are many positions around, under and inside of the air craft, so a few supervisors are on hand to make sure job positions and assignments are conducted and executed by certified employees in a timely and safely manner. The hardest part of the job is trying to be safe at all times. There are protocols and safety procedures needed for every position in and around the plane. One simple mistake may lead to loosing a limb, crushing someone or death. Safety is a priority! Overall, I would recommend working at UPS. There are many positions and different departments, it makes it easy to transfer within the company. And the people I work with, makes my job fun. I look forward to going into work everyday."
good,"Constant movement,Fast paced environment, close attention to details,time efficient work.Manufacturing facility clean.Management reclusive,In-line supervisors non responsive."
good,Dealing with all types of customers and need to know how to handle each one in the proper manner. Learning how to properly pack packages according to what it is that the customer is sending.
good,Loved the people I worked with and still talked to them when I see them out in the route.. They are still friendly and keep in touch with me also. ...
good,Ups worked you hours at various times per day.  You did not know your hours until the day of work they called you.  No one liked this about ups.  I drove doubles and singles for ups.
good,"Hard and often satisfying work. Process driven and intense integrity required. The employees live and breath the culture. Life and work balance is a sore spot, the demand for more time leaves the home front often overlooked."
good,Working at ups was fun and busy especially during holiday season. I learned how to lift heavy item properly. It was a good and easy temp job and I enjoyed it.
good,"Personally. I love the job. It's nothing like retail or food. I do find the lack of hours and lack of decent pay to be upsetting. Expect a fast pace, heavy and hard lifting enviroment from the ground up. Even when I was trained for hours over two weeks, I was kept at the same pay rate."
good,"I worked at ups in Tualatin , OR at the customer counter. I was there as a temp to hire. I was trained well then trained others. Great pay for being straight out of high school but it’s upsetting they were not trasperant weather I was going to be hired or not. I trained 2 people who were hired and promoted and last minute I was told I wouldn’t be. I worked weekends alone 8am-about 4 only but being alone and having no packages brought up would bring me many angry customers . Not to mention customer service would say “your package is there go get it”, and wouldn’t look at the actual scans so customers would come in for me to say it’s in a truck and I can’t go look through trucks to get it (this is for both saturdays and normal days)No managers in building but me as well on saturdays . Also my manager had no idea how to do my job. So unsure how she was able to say I was not fit to be hired after a year and teaching her how to do my job and training 2-3 others plus being bilingual in a heavy Hispanic town. Great job and pay , just wish I would’ve had more communication with hiring process."
good,"As a driver supervisor you spend long hours at work away from the family. The pay did not compensate for the amount of hours spent at work, doing ridiculous paper work and reports. The current management is not in touch with what is going on in the building. I spent more 3 decades with this company and spent only a short time as a supervisor. On the drivers side it was a great experience and spent more that 2 decades enjoyed the customer interaction. Loved every route that I bid on and ran for many years. The compensation was great and so were the benefits."
good,The management could be a lot better. They never have answers to questions an when they do all managements answers differ. It’s a fast paced work place which I do like.
good,UPS is a great corporation to work for. There are many different opportunities to learn and advance within. UPS also has great compensation and health  benefits.
good,"Delivered packages to homes and businesses"
good,Managers can be confrontational and the environment is highly stressful. Those with more seniority will give you a rough time. I was even harassed by them. Extra Hours are given to employees by the length of time employed.
good,Not sure what time you get off work and I don't want to be a part of the team that has been in the works.  Play with the same time as a result of the team that has.
good,"Good job to get out of high school"
good,"UPS is a great company to make good money and have a decent living. They are strongly commited to respecting seniorty and promoting within. So at the beginning your going to get the short end of the stick. However the health benefits are excellent. Sadly though certain jobs like being a driver is harsh on the body after time from doing it an the hours are extremely long.  You leave home in the morning an won't come back til late in the evening. The management team is very poor, favoritism is shown an employees that don't work hard get rewarded with shorter days. If your a work horse they will take advantage of you."
good,Great excersice however sometimes frustrating.i did like working with a teammate as it sped up the day however I found it deeply irritating after I finished with our route and instead of being finished having to go help someone else.
good,"Tough company to work for, learn a lot, highly structured union environment. Good money, highly engineered to get the most out of every employee. Manage by intimidation. Few retire in management, terminated or quit."
good,"Worked part time as a driver helper, seasonal, and you get the hours you ask for, beg for hours, you'll likely get them. Great manager, had a wonderful driver."
good,Fast-paced place ti work. Pay is not enough for the job that you do. It takes 3 or more years to get to where you are making good money. The starting pay is below other major logistic companies.
good,"A good place to work if you are right out of college, not for the older generation. UPS wants the cheaper labor. The older workforce has no chance of moving up. I was passed up twice and I have more experience and education."
good,I worked there only because they paid for my education. There was a program called the CRCP and they paid for my full education at a select amount of community colleges.
good,Company prides itself from promoting within but management is not always considerate with personal and professional goals. Each job I had did not consist of much training so you learn on your own.
good,Management allowed employees to make extremely expensive mistakes without any disciplinary action. They did not want to be the bad guy by making employees pay for their mistakes. Instead management reassigned these employees to positions that were impossible to screw-up. As a result the rest of the staff was force to pick up the slack. I had finally had enough.
good,"A day at ups was very stressful, although there are a lot of benefits that come with it the work/labor does not add up. Id come home everyday ready to pass out, they take advantage of good workers."
good,Temporary assignment that would not give me any access to a full career situation at this site. A seasonal position that was fast paced and stressful.
good,"Always short-handed staff management was not on top of issues no room to move up at all scheduling was a nightmare glitchy punch in system on s positive note it's not ups as a company it was the management"
good,work your way up the totem pole and your good bad thing is it takes forever. management lies and treats you how they want union doesn't represent you they back the sups
good,I started at UPS as a contract hire and wanted to become a full time employee and inquired to my direct manager several times but he refused to hire me.  The supervisors and co-workers were very helpful and a pleasure to work with.
good,Good place but lacks communication.  You have to put the job first even before your health and family .  Management is new ans shoots from the hip when proceeding with discipline.
good,loaded trucks with packages then went out to deliver all around the city after leaving the warehouse during the christmas holidays getting signatures or leaving pick up notations on doors
good,"Great training for outside sales, however; I feel that the longer you stay in Inside Sales, the harder it becomes to be considered for outside opportunities."
good,No accountability.  More stock put in a four year degree than in experience.  Promotes quickly but success rate is very low.  Waste of time and resources due to management having their own agendas.  UPS would rather run inside sales their way with the management team that grew up within as opposed to a proven track record of other companies.  New blood would be great for the company.  Each level/position needs coaching and accountability.
good,The staff there are friendly and very co-operative . The atmosphere is conducive for working and am eagerly looking forward to be re-employed in another field .
good,I was able to obtain my notary commission and Live Scan. Was a great place to grow and they even helped me with going on my maternity leave. I worked in customer service but also preformed majority of notaries through out the day
good,The benefits and pay out rank the atmosphere.  There is rarely opportunity for advancement out of part-time.  Management is not as friendly as others and rarely work together for problem solving.
good,Typical day at work was loading and unloading trucks as needed.  Learned how to use a scanner to know which trucks were to be loaded.  Management seems to be very organized.  The pace was busy.  This was contract works.
good,Working for Ups was very productive. Coworkers where great and easy to get along and work with as a team. There where no problems and everyone was helpful when needed.
good,"I wouldn't say they job sucked, but I've definitely had better Warehouse jobs. They often want you to reach insane speeds and accuracy, which isn't difficult at the beginning of the week, but two days in your dying of muscle fatigue."
good,"Fast-paced and time sensative. Very little to no down time, must have great people skills due to constant customer contact, physically and mentally demanding"
good,I've worked for UPS during the winter season. Its fast paced and at times exhausting but you are fairly compensated for your efforts and given time to honor your own commitments.
good,"A great company to build yourself."
good,"A typical work day started in the early mornings in a fast paced environment, lifting moderate to heavy packages repetitively through the morning to prepare trucks for deliveries."
good,"long hours, very stressful.  goals that are unrealistic.  union environment and bad employees were impossible to terminate.  good career growth oppurtunities"
good,"I enjoy working for UPS freight, fast pace, challenging for myself but could be overwhelming to most. There's a  lot of info given and needed to know in a short amount of time. Management is something like no other. Great people who lack team-work."
good,"Not really much to the job. Show up, unload boxes onto an assembly belt until you leave. Usually work about 5-6 hours a day with a 10 minute break in the middle."
good,"•	Driver Helper is an ideal role for many people. It’s perfect for college students who return home (or remain on campus) during winter break. It’s a great opportunity for a stay-at-home parent looking for serious cash as the holiday season approaches. Above all, this is one of the roles where someone who’s serious about their future can make their mark with UPS, regardless of where you are in life. Sure, it requires some heavy lifting (up to 35 lbs.), but who isn’t looking for a healthy job these days? Most significantly, the Seasonal Driver Helper will be delivering merriment and cheer throughout the holiday season to the residents of the communities in which they live! This is a vital role in UPS seasonal operations that offers long-term career advancement with a Fortune 50 Employer. No drivers’ license is required – only reliable transportation – and the dedicated Seasonal Driver Helper will by picked up by the Package Delivery Driver on a local route"
good,"Enjoyed delivering packages to community members. Challenges to overcome included physical demands, working in the dark and overcoming the elements of weather.."
good,"It's a fast paced environment but the pay and benefits are Great!"
good,great part time shifts and school benefits to fit in with most people's schedules. they keep you busy so time goes by fast and you get a workout in through out the night
good,I really liked working at The UPS Store. My first and favorite job I have had. My coworkers were an example of how a team should work together and get things done.
good,"Very busy office but very good management.  It does require heavy lifting which is troublesome when the package is over 50lbs.  I have many different responsibilities that require multi tasking.  I am a team player and get along very well with customers and coworkers. I package items for shipment, process the shipments, renew mailboxes and set up new mailboxes, forward mail to some of our customers, call customers for various reasons, make copies, scan and email customers files, print mail from our computer,  I also open the store  1 day per week and close 1 night. I also take payments for various services required by our customers"
good,I love to hustle but the driver that i was working with was a complete waste of time. Was no encouragement to continue working with him.He was just a complete pain that's all.
good,"Typical day is loading, and sorting packages into truck. Need to lift up to 150 pounds. Enjoyable part of job is the fact that you get in and out of work before most people are even up for their day."
good,"The position was a fast paced and stressful work environment, processing and distributing parcel mail and packages. As a young college student at the time, I learned how to sharpen my multitasking skills by learning various function within our operation. "
good,The store are franchised and each owner is different. The store I worked for was great as is the owner. Just no room for improvement or benefits offered.
good,It was an okay job. Tuition reimbursement was the only benefit offered and had to quit because I wasn't able to get a different shift for my class schedule.
good,The UPS Store provides a great opportunity to gain experience in customer service and the field of logistics and packaging. I would recommend this job.
good,"UPS is a very harsh environment in which to work, 80 degree days meant 110 degrees at the back of the trucks. with that being said, UPS taught me great discipline & work ethic."
good,Minimal wage gap between hourly and management pay scales detours advancement of qualified individuals. This leads to young new supervisors with little experience
good,"Took on this role while in school part time and really enjoyed it, but the manual labor was intense. From the extreme heat to extreme cold. Another great learning experience that benefits my tenacious work ethic."
good,early rise but worth the work out. hours went by quickly. hardest was when you didn't have the extra help with the heaviest boxes. otherwise a job that is worth having if you like the early rise and the workout.
good,"tough as h toeck stick a route in the cville va location. Its very cut throat! You only have one opportunity with this company. if you do not get it the first time, you will not have a job."
good,"Come in, clock in, and get right to work. during work time one must stay vigilant on your surroundings to do ones job carefully because of the loud work in environment. everyone gets along for the most part to help speed things along. management is quite like us regular workers, always there helping when ever it's needed. now it gets a bit murky with high ups that come to the work area, because I do not know if they worked in the same position as a regular worker or just got there the first time but that creates a disconnect between a normal worker and the higher ups. Other thing is it can quite hot in the work place. what liked about my time there was connecting with my coworkers and learning about their lives, motivation, and hobbies."
good,"Being a Seasonal Driver Helper was a real test of endurance, strength, and awareness. I had rode with a Driver that was experienced and a joy to work with, but above all the work came first. You'll be jumping (not literally) in-and-out of your office/truck and you'd have to make delivers at residencies and business fast and be back in your truck for the next drop. The ride to the next delivery (for the Helper) are your breaks. I enjoyed it, I liked interacting with the people and the work was a real workout! You won't have the energy to go to the gym after if you really applied yourself, your thighs would be burning, you'd be exhausted...it was real laborious. So, if you need to loss a few pounds and earn a paycheck at the same time you should try being a Helper for a Season."
good,Great entry level position for those looking into getting in to the transportation industry. Good place for recent college graduates to apply and start their first career
good,The position i held co-workers i worked with and supervisors who i worked with and managers who manged me were not horrible. overall it served its purpose.
good,Working for UPS was a job that was fast-paced and high volume. The different people I worked with were friendly and helpful in explaining the duties of the job. I was able to work outside with physical activity. I would not hesitate to recommend UPS to another person who needs a job.
good,a typical night at work was short hours and not enough hours in the work time. the only time one can really make a decent pay check for the amount of work youre doing is doing peak time which is the holiday session. definately a great job if you can advance.
good,It was very simple and easy and really good for someone going to school. It teaches you good customer service skills. But I wish the pay was just a little better.
good,"Overall the atmosphere at work is disappointing. Last year our management structure changed and things have been bleak ever since. A typical day at work is full of ideas being shot down. Daily reviews are taken off topic as soon as they start and do not get back on track. Once the reviews are over you leave the office feeling disgruntled and unmotivated. "
good,The UPS Store was a easy fun place to work. I enjoyed serving my customers. However there is not any room for advancement with this company. The salary was low and hardly increased over the 7 years I was the manager.
good,"The UPS Store is a franchise, privately, family-owned company.  Only 6 employees.  It is a fun, tight-knit group.  It is a fast-paced demanding job requiring lots of on-hand knowledge.  The main goal is to provide excellent customer service and to provide shipping services throughout the world via UPS and other carriers.  Employees are tasked with knowing and being able to navigate company software, distribute US mail, and any other tasks assigned to associates"
good,The job itself is really physically fast paced.. It's a good job to have for those who like to work out but can't make it to a gym.. The management could be a bit  better though..
good,I love the interaction with the customers. Both the customers that come in every day and the new ones. I love interacting with people and this job gives me a great opportunity to this.
good,The days were long but I would accomplish a lot and with these accomplishments came wonderful learning experiences for both the work force and home life. The best part of the job was interacting with regular shippers and the box holders who come in to get their packages and mail. My least favorite part was the amount of drama that came from management and other coworkers and sometimes it makes the work environment difficult to work in.
good,the work is back breaking at first but you do get used to it it is weekly pay so that's always a plus supervisors don't do much of anything when short handed and leave the work to us when we are already behind
good,"It can be a fun place to work but it's highly stressful for the few hours you're there.  There's an hierarchy because it's a Union job so that blows, especially if you want to move up in the world because you'll get skipped over for a promotion so the guy who works 2 days a week for 20 years can become a driver.  You can skip work without any consequences though, and one guy had been fired and rehired 3 times because they couldn't get any one else to work there."
good,Again this is a Union company and with all Union companies in the Freight industry its a great US against THEM mentality.  If you ever take a job in this industry be prepared for a good dose of the union hating you for existing and the management wanting to double down on you because they can't control the employees.   They promote from within BUT they have loss growth to Fedex every year for over a decade so you will get promoted to PT manager and stay there for LIFE.
good,"Not enough hours for the length of time I had to travel. I was hard work for my age.  Management was very courteous.  They did supply snacks and shirts, promotional  items on a regular basis."
good,I am a four time cancer survivor and the health benefits for my $20K a month medicine treatment. Also great  opportunities for going back to school with tuition assistance of up to about fifteen hundred a quarter
good,"No real advancement opportunities and low pay, very few benefits.Hours are somewhat flexible but you dodn't really make enough money to live off of. Seems to be collusion among owners to limit what an employee can make."
good,"Ups I a Great job to have if your in it for the long run. It just so, stressful right now. Just working in UPS right now is hard working between 10-12 hrs a day. Real body tearing down."
good,"Would have been a better more stable position if they were better organized. Not freindly to newer drivers, cater to near retired drivers. No lead time in when working or not."
good,"A typical work day as the driver helper was always busy. Be prepared to do more work than the driver. It seemed like when I was added to his route he began to do less work each day. I know my position was to help him, but I walked almost every package to its location. He was a nice guy. It was often hot but mainly cold. I liked it for the time being."
good,"Unless they keep you past peak season, there is no job security. There is a union, but they do nothing but take a massive amount of your puny paycheck. There is no guarantee that you can become full time, but if you are really good at your job, you can easily become a part of management. It can sometimes be difficult to stay motivated, especially with the negative attitudes of coworkers. Overall, it's a great job for someone that has no serious bills to pay."
good,working as a driver helper isa pretty easy job.  ride around with your driver and put packages on peoples door.  its not rocket science. it helps if you get along with your driver.
good,I really enjoyed working at UPS Store. I had weekends off due to weekends mostly being for students and I was off by 7 pm. Once you learn the job it is very easy. As long as you keep a positive upbeat attitude you'll make it in this job because if you make a mistake on a shipping label or packaging you're held accountable and will have to fix your mistake and deal with the customer. Other than that it is very laid back.
good,"Tuition assistance along with insurance is offered, which makes it almost worth it.  Culture is very based on making your area run the best, without regards for helping your partners."
good,After a couple years reached max potential  no where to go from there. Managed for 8 years no motivatio n from owners to market reorganize store nothing
good,The union has been able to retain a great healthcare benefits package for a part-time employee.  Hopefully it stays that way with every future contract negotiation!
good,"Though I was working part time, each day that I worked felt like a full day. That said, I did enjoy the work. The benefits were excellent. I worked at UPS for about 8 months."
good,"UPS demands a lot of your time and effort. Generally, most full time positions pay well. Very militant atmosphere. Very fast paced. Great for someone that enjoys constant problem solving."
good,"A typical day here is you are overworked with a 10 minute break, you don't get enough hours and the pay isn't great for what we have to do. I do enjoy the people but some of the management doesn't seem like they deserve their job. They live by the whole ""it's above my pay grade"" mentality."
good,This job was very consistent and straight forward. There was a variety of diverse ethnic backgrounds which was very nice. And working the warehouse was very busy and fast paced which made the time go by faster but also improved my skills to multi-task within a sufficient amount of time.
good,"Standard for a seasonal job, drive your own vehicle to a location to meet with driver, jump in the truck with the regular driver and go to customers homes delivering packages through the day."
good,Great place to work if you like constantly changing demands. I thought it was very rewarding and learned a lot from working there. Its all about coordination and timing.
good,"Malgré es horaires de nuit qui étaient fatigants, l'équipe était très sociable. Le travail en lui-même n'était pas compliqué à intégrer, mais la charge de travail était lourde et pénible."
good,"ok company to work for....looking for better scheduling, time wise the hours are a bit odd...weekend is short due to early return Monday starting time..In search of more hours and better salary and returning to work in my job field"
good,"It was very easy, simple manual labor to deliver packages. The hours and daily location shuffle was definitely not the best organized, but it was an overall okay experience."
good,"My time at the United Parcel Service has been the best learning experience a young professional could ask for after school. I have great mentors, bosses and co-workers that really make my time at UPS enjoyable."
good,UPS-SCS is one of the best places to work as long as you are aware that as a Supervisor or manager you would be expected to work as long as necessary to get the job done in the time frame and with the financial approval of the project.This could mean travelling and being gone from my family for a week or 2 at a time (very normal). This is why most UPS-SCS management have gone through multiple families during their work tenure.
good,"Travail intense avec beaucoup de pression. "
good,"Angenehmes niederländisches Arbeitsklima."
good,My experience as a ups associate i gave my best. The coworkers were understanding and easy to get along with and would offer help to any new trainee. Have an amazing worker appreciation program as well.
good,"input data into the system for us customs I learned how to read a tariff book and classify products.  Management was terrible and had no respect for its employees with lack of communication.  Some of the co-workers were ok and others where not,  The hardest part about the job was people not working together and this best thing was working overtime or on off shift."
good,"A typical day of work for a supervisor at UPS usually consisted of a lot of running around watching employees and equipment to make sure everything was working safely and efficiently. I learned many lessons at UPS like communicating with co-workers, and keeping a positive attitude throughout the work place. Management was a different story not much help came from my full time supervisors. I went through many problems with employees because of my full times. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor, but this didnt keep me from enjoying the people on my work force, and getting to know new people that came into UPS."
good,opportunities for advancement. times have changed. greatest part dealing with people and customers. no admin people therefore too much demands on administrative functions. cant see the forest for the trees
good,"worked with some awesome people and learnt many new things"
good,"I usually start by opening the store in the morning. Turning everything on, counting the drawers, cleaning the floor if necessary. Then I open the store for customers and then pack & ship packages for them. Or process returns. I learned how to pack and ship properly, handle multiple customers at once, do claims for packages."
good,UPS season help isn't bad especially if you like to work hard and keep busy. You do have to work hard you really can't slack cause they do not put up with it.
good,Good pay but night shifts = no work leisure balance. Management on the shift could have been better. Sometimes very short notice when needed to start early so was very hard trying to adjust sleep pattern at a consistent level.
good,"Die Arbeit war Kraftaufwändig aber nach paar Wochen gewöhnt man sich dran, allerdings das Management war unmöglich."
good,It was an okay place to work. The hours kind of sucked cause it takes up every week night from 5:30 til about 10 every night so definitely cuts into a social life.
good,first youd have to pick and then check and then pack and then shipp and then load the truck and then manifest sign off it goes
good,"Helped customers with whatevrr they needed help with such as shipping, printing, faxing. Worked a lot on the computer more than anything else."
good,Il est dommage de mettre des gens incompétents sur un poste de management d'agence. Cela porte préjudice à la société et à l'ensemble du personnel
good,very tough and physical job but great customers who go out of there way for you get ready for some long days must be very organized
good,"They will get their work out of you. You will sweat until your whole shirt is wet. It's dark, dusty, messy but you're not alone most of the time. At least at the beginning they have a good trainer help you but eventually it turns to managers. Managers are the worst because even though they have been in your spot they still want you to drop everything and let your belt back up just to sign some papers at the other end of the building and trust me they will for your first month. Your coworkers will also hate you for a little bit as you're the new guy and they need to not only compensate for your slowness but also deal with any messes (eg box opening and spilling or a wall of boxes falling on you). One amazing thing though is this job can replace your gym membership."
good,UPS provides the package delivery options that are needed for many businesses in the world. The pay is excellent but the hours are long. An average day starts at seven in the morning and finishes at nine or ten in the evening. Like any business there is pressure to perform which is needed for success. Overall the experience was enlightening and well worth it.
good,"A typical day for me at UPS, was a lot of proof reading, calendar management, Excel spreadsheets and answering the SVP's calls and responding to their emails from outside clients, Great co workers, I am still in contact with a few of old co workers and manager. there were not any hard parts of this job. The most enjoyable part of that job was the fun we had it was always and incentive for us the manager made it fun for team building reasons"
good,I enjoyed my job at UPS very much until I became ill but for the short time I worked there was a enjoyable experience. I felt like I was part of a team to get the product loaded by the time the drivers arrived for work. I learned as you go along you get faster and faster and more efficient.
good,"Gained a lot of knowledge about the industry, Business is booming and tends to be very busy, Most enjoyable part of job are two of the coworkers."
good,"GREAT company, unfortunately in my rural area the hours and long term potential are very limited. THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK FOR!! HOWEVER as a Cover Driver be prepared for very limited hours in rural areas. UPS equipment & training are excellent. I was treated respectfully by management and experienced drivers."
good,"I loved what I did out there, just wished it wasn't a seasonal position and could have been full time employment."
good,A typicals day work at a ups store consists of 100 percent customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to come from seeing the satisfaction of customers. A happy customer equals a happy day at work. Co workers are mostly students. This job is very flexible as far as scheduling goes. Turn over rate is very high. Management has taught me the ins and outs of running a solid business practice.
good,"Mainly customer service and data input. Taking care of customer needs with a friendly smile, occasionally packaging items for shipping or loading the UPS truck. Knowledge of photoshop or any picture editing software would help as they do print signs/banners for customers."
good,Management is the most unorganized situation I have ever seen for a major company. I would come in some days and they would send me home and say try again the next day. Say things to make you feel good and not fall thru.
good,It was a fun and comfortable place to work but there were no benefits and there was no way to advance. The management was kind and easy to work for.
good,"could be better than it is then I would be there still"
good,Seemed good. Owner was a little mean at times. Was very hectic. Granted I started working there at the grand opening. That was a fun first day.
good,depending on what business unit you are in the work life balance is poor.  Regular 10 hour days in some parts of the year.  good people to work with.
good,Management and work atmosphere was amazing. Management was supportive and understanding of family time and was willing to adjust schedule if needed. The family aspect of the management was amazing.
good,After getting hired as a full UPS employee. You have to wait 3 months before getting discretionary time. This time is to help for emergencies like kids being sick. You can only have 4 unexcused absences and then you fired. Having children and the start of the school year I already have 3. It is very hard to not have an unexcused absence when you have small children because the day cares will not take a sick child.
good,"You will get your skills level enhanced by working for this company. However, the growth can be slow but if you prepare to stay long term it will bring you up the ranks and have resources to train you."
good,"UPS was rough but it was my first job working on the books. It was a need not a want as I was going to community college at the time so I figured I could do the Twilight hour shift."
good,We owned a UPS Store franchise You  are supposed to be you own boss instead ups tells you everything to do and you take the risk financially. You have no say so in the business while they find ways to reduce you profits buy moving things to online and removing the store profit and increasing overhead.
good,very fast pace job which I liked because it made the night go past quickly. Enjoyed all my night sort co-workers as well. Everyone tries their best to help each-other out to get the jobs done on its scheduled times.
good,A normal day at work is entertaining . I learned no matter what you gotta strive for what u want. i get along with everyone.
good,Don't really have much to say but there was a lot of packages being loaded on trucks when i worked there. There were not enough hours available for work. The supervisors were not attentive.
good,You see lots of people working very hard. Good benefits and lost of flexible times to work. You can go to School and UPS will help you pay for it.
good,"Waited for planes, unload and reload planes, met some nice people and got the job done. The only part I didnt like was working in the cold."
good,It was just that manajment didn't care about there employees. But other than that. Everyone was nice who worked there. The hardiest part of the job was rush of boxies that would come during the holidays.
good,Nous étions tous heureux de travailler car le respect était reciproque et une ambiance totale
good,This job has confirmed my ability to effectively supervise employees especially in an environment that happens to be different from my previous experience. I enjoy the interaction with the employees in my work area.
good,I find my immediate management good but the hours are a lot longer than discussed and that I would like in my current position.
good,Very fast paced work place with driven associates willing to do whatever it took to get the job done. Awesome benefits and opportunity to work and go to school.
good,The job is back breaking but hard work goes a long way. I do not mind working here but I need more financial stability. The co workers are decent. Get paid every week is a plus but the check are short and hard to survive as well...
good,If you need a job. and Hours dont really matter to you its the perfect job. its more for young adults looking to spend years in order to move up.
good,"Typical you arrive, work and then go home. Social interaction is limited as everyone is busy doing their own thing. Management "
good,"I loved working there.  My supervisor knew I had a second job so he gave me leeway re travel.  I got along with my co-workers and when I got my CDL license, I was allowed to drive a truck."
good,"Working in a high volume processing facility that runs 24/7.  "
good,"I worked for the The UPS Store , which was a franchise owed business. The down fall to  working for a franchise is that you don't get the benefits that you would get with corporate. Typical day includes opening store ,  maintain and balance register, ship and pack packages."
good,"Greeting the customers, learn different things on the computer,"
good,This place of business gave me the opportunity to meet and help different people and assist them with whatever needs that they required from making a copy
good,"I loaded, sorted, and delivered parcels from 2:30am until 5:00pm. I learned to control my sleepiness. I learned how to alphabetically put parcels in order at a fast pase. My superviors always wanted more and pushed me as far as possible. The hardest part of the job was listening to others talk bad about the job. I really enjoyed learning new things and working hard for what I received."
good,"I was employed as seasonal help as a Driver Helper. You were taught with minimal training to get the job done while aiding the driver. I delivered to a mall so I took a cart load of packages and did my drops back and forth all day. It was pretty straight forward but whether you have a million stops or five, you have to get it done by a certain time, which can be overwhelming as a new hire. Management could have been better as well."
good,"When I frist started with UPS I had worked same place for about 3 years,and after the UPS lost the contract.Then the UPS sent me to work so many  different places.Over all I do not have any complain about my work with UPS at all.I got along with my bosses,employees very well.The hardest part of the job that some night I worked at the  place is dart and quite kin of scary."
good,its a good company if you want to stay part time your whole life.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at UPS.  I worked there for ten years on nights when I lived in Louisville, KY.  Then after moving back to Bardstown, KY in 2013 I started working back at UPS in Louisville, KY.  I stayed at UPS from July 2013 to December 2014.  I ended up quitting my job because it wasn't working out financially.  After paying for daycare, gas, and insurance I was only making $80/week to the good. I am looking for a full time job in Bardstown, KY so I don't have to drive sixty miles one way to work."
good,"I do like my job with UPS. The driver that I have been assigned to is a very nice person."
good,The hardest place I've ever worked at. It was managed poorly and the moral of most workers was low. Most people were unprofessional. I will probably never work there again based on my first experience there. The advancement isn't good so there is not much incentive at all.
good,A boat load of work and not the greatest total compensation for the effort
good,"A typical work day was fast paced. I learned how to supervise employees. The management was good, could have provided more training. Co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was working with the union. The more enjoyable part of the job was seeing employees succeed."
good,Learned a lot about how to run a business and now know what it takes to make it successful.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 8:45 having our morning meeting, at around 9am all drivers start leaving for their routes. I would drive to Loganville to do my deliveries which was about 140-180 stops. I would usually finish around 7:30pm. I learned a lot of different areas and businesses, I also learned how to manage my time better. Management team was ok. My co-workers were great they help me learn more about the job and how to get through the day. The hardest part of the job was lifting some of the odd shaped items. The thing I really enjoyed about the job was the customers they made my day."
good,I helped a UPS driver deliver packages during the Christmas season.  The drivers and supervisors were friendly and helpful.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather.  Most enjoyable part was working with a friendly driver.
good,Good work place but poor advancement opportunity.Great benefits unfair opportunity  for advancement.
good,"I was a drivers helper at UPS Oct 2013- Jan 2014, the drivers were supposed to call before leaving the hub by 8:30a.m and give me the time and place we'd meet. I worked with several drivers. The first one replaced me when I was'nt able to work the day after hemorrhaging on the job and had gone to the E.R. He said it was'nt me, he had someone he wanted to work with. I was reassigned after a few other drivers to a route with an arrogant jerk that milked the clock, was lazy, rude, and totally unprofessional. He dropped me off to deliver a package then made me walk on a busy road to meet him 1/4mile up the road- he drove past the stop he left me at! I had to cross Broad Street, which has alot of traffic, two times! I told him to NEVER do that to me again, then he argued with me and threatened calling in. I told him go ahead, as I knew that he put me in danger and was being a jerk. I was reassigned again, but the politics and attitude amongst the drivers is totally unproffessional. They are union and hourly so they milk the clock and overwork the helpers. I delivered more packeages alone in the alotted time then the driver & I had ever done together. He sat in the truck counting stops and I ran my butt off. UPS cares about stats, not the well being of employees. They have job security, but who wants to work like a dog from 7:30am-7pm, have no life, do physical labor, have their truck loaded wrone daily and have no help? No me. They have employees that stay there to retire because they learn how to play the management that is playing them and are too lazy to do anything else. If UPS"
good,"Climate controlled"
good,"Work from the time you clock in, until the time you clock out; with a lot of heavy lifting."
good,A typical day was you never knew how many hours  your going to work. Some days would be 12 and others you would go home. This was a warehouse for medical parts for our military and hospitals. I learned everything there was about how a warehouse operated. Most of my co-workers were great  people that would always be willing to do their jobs and do it with success. The hardest part of this job was not being guaranteed full time hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was the paid lunches.
good,"Pressure to finish what you started, not leaving the day till the job is done."
good,"Working at Store 1733 is great. The people I work with make the job that much more enjoyable. There's never a dull moment while here, whether it's because of the customers that are constantly seeking our services, or because the employees are sharing a few jokes, smiles and laughter constantly fill the area. For me, the main issue is the distance. I live in Spring, near the Woodlands, while this store is located downtown. It's an obstacle to overcome but a big one indeed. Sadly, there's no benefits, nothing really to rely on, it's like having a part time job in high school. There doesn't seem to be a firm grasp as to how any promotions or raises work. I was promised a raise after a certain time of me being there, and when the time came, it was disregarded. Overall, a great place to be, but like any place, it needs a few improvements."
good,"A typical day involved getting to work about twenty mins. early. Having a saftey meeting to talk about the important things that maybe going on or to make sure we are preforming our job correctly. Then go start to load our trucks.Normally we would have more than one truck. When you have two trucks it a bit hard to keep up, but it gives you the ability to deal with stress better."
good,"Fun job shipping items for customers to anywhere in the US to International, using USPS or UPS. We also did everything from making copies to laminiating, special order prints and providing mail boxes."
good,"iafter clocking in id go to my assigned work place until ever one had arrived then would start.the start consist of standing at a belt,and when the mail came down the belt you'd pick it put and place on a truck."
good,"Each day is fairly unpredictable as to how busy it will be. It is usually comprised of fulfilling online orders, helping customers with copying and shipping packages, and maintaining a clean and welcoming appearance throughout the store."
good,I loved UPS . but it was an seasonal job. but I wish they hired me there I would love to work there
good,"Organized packages "
good,Great Job!  they set my career path and allowed me to raise my family as well.
good,Starting a family and based on the current situation needed full time employment
good,Hardest part of job is managing the overflow of work.  Co workers are the best and great atmosphere with coworkers.  Learned a great deal each day as each day is different.  Something new happens each week.  Very diverse position.
good,ups gave me a chance i will be grateful for the opportunity they given me. i have nothing bad to say.
good,I learned a lot while I was employed by the owner of a UPS Store. I was there almost 2 years and eventually left the job while I was in a management position. I gained a lot of knowledge about small business and received a behind the scenes look into the retail market. The best part of my job was the responsibility and the pleasure of conversing with the regular customers that came in. Alternatively the worst part would have to be the customers that came with a bad attitude. The hardest part of the job was probably the lack of flexibility. I was lucky enough to give some input as to who I would be working with which proved to be a great help in the long run. I learned a lot at my time with The Ups Store
good,I would at a moments notice pick up freight and deliver it anywhere in the country 
good,Leuke bijbaan naast mijn studie. Na afstuderen ben ik daar blijven werken totdat ik een passende baan heb gevonden.
good,the job was a typical job for anyone looking for employment. the issue was the staff and their attitude. the management was very shoddy everyone was their own boss.
good,They run a tight ship. You have to be aware everything there. Make little mistakes and you will be rewarded with great benefits and pay. Management can be a little difficult to work with.
good,It reaches how to work under pressure and how to turn stress into an asset instead of a liability.
good,I worked shift work so I came in at different times. Upon arrival go clock in and report to loading dock. Loading dock is a fast paced job. Loading pkgs. weighing up to about 40-50 lbs. Leaned how to load quickly and efficiently to get the most out of my time. The hardest part of the job was the split shifts. The most enjoyable part is working the docks. I love working warehouse/dock.
good,"I hated this job, but I stuck it out. Then I decided to persue something better."
good,for 5 hours you will be loading trucks none sto[p in all different types of wheather
good,there wasnt enough hours to work i work hard did what i was told and trained anyone they wanted me to pay wasnt the right pay
good,"My 20 year career at UPS has given me such a vast amount of knowledge and skills. In particular, I enjoyed my position as a Comprehensive Health & Safety Supervisor. Training tends to be one of my strengths and this position enabled me to demonstrate my ability and perfect my technique. Working with people is not only a strength of mine, but is one of the most enjoyable things I did in my career."
good,It was a fast pace work area because we had to get alot of items on the truck at a certin time it was team work at UPS Warehouse but the hours was really long for me i had 2 small kids at home and i am a single parent
good,"great coworkers we really pulled together when we needed too. hardest part of the job was the management, i had the best time when I was on the road."
good,"I learned a lot of skills here, but they do not give you enough hours to be able to live."
good,"Be prepared to work, ALOT!!! They expect a lot and give very little. The compensation is good but if you break it down per hours worked it is not that good."
good,A typical day at work includes about 8 hours in office and an additional 2-3 hours of phone calls
good,Provided customers with shipping rates by phone or in person using the computer.
good,"Monitor the time and materials on project including document imaging and processing.Coordinated and verified the status of the project process while leading team members to ensure deliverables where met by acting as liaison between the management team and the third party company.Communicate with customers and assist with benefit distribution.Provide administrative support for the department/division such as answering telephones, assisting visitors, and resolving and referring a range of administrative problems and inquiries."
good,Every morning we would have a meeting. We would get a list of daily duties then fulfill them. My co-workers were easy to work with. I did not feel that any part of my job was difficult.
good,"Deliver 150- 300 packages daily. Picked up 75-100 packages daily. Handled hazardous materials.I learned how to prioritize my time. We were a union shop, but co-workers were still somewhat clickish. Management treated pretty well.Job taught me how to organize my thoughts and to be very efficient with my time and a sense of urgency.Also helped to deal with people no matter what type of day they were having,not to take things personally. Best part of the day was to see the enjoyment in the customers face when delivering something they ere waiting for."
good,work is very rough and fast paced but safety is always first but management sometimes is nice then other days they are very rough on employees. I learned lots of hard work the hard way and coworkers are really stressed here. I say best position here is to be a driver.
good,clock in at 10:15 sort time is 10:30
good,• Coordinate delivery packages to the correct belt for proper shipping
good,this job in the long run is worth the wait if you really want it you have to work hard for it and know what you want for your future goals because in the end it is your life and your familys life that depends on it.
good,You have your meeting and the after that you would goto work doing your speific job. You have the chance to leran many diffrent skills there.
good,The compesation and benefits are great . You need to have tough skin to work in this company . You must be comfotable working in a prodominantly male work place.
good,"UPS gives you great opportunities such as education, becoming an truck driver, having great benifits and etc."
good,UPS was a fun place to work with customer's and also help them with any questions they did not understand. Packing safely and correctly for customer's package inside could be mailed with out damage when being delivered to the mailing address.
good,"It has been a great experience to work at UPS-SCS, The only bad experience for me is that I had to quit for personal reason and have been a great employee, in fact, one of the best and at the time i was leaving the management promised me that they will let me make a come back as soon as I am good my situation. I have applied back two years ago and got no response, called supervisor and the manager, left messages but no reponse. They would not understand that there could circumstances in a person's life."
good,"Basic driver helper duties.  Did not help in moving to a more permanent position.  No real training was necessary, the driver was very appreciative of my efforts."
good,"You’re constantly on your toes, there are so many packages that rush down toward you and you have to sort them, scan and load them onto the correct trucks. The sizes of the packages are all different, some easy to deal with, others weighing up to over 100 pounds. You’re definitely gonna get a workout working at ups and it can sometimes be easy to become overwhelmed by everything, the supervisors are constantly rushing you to get the job done which was annoying since there was so much to take account for but it’s understandable."
good,A lot of back braking work tons of opportunities. Is very nice having benifits and being able to work for the union. Not to flexible on hours but they work with your schedule for the most part
good,"If you stay ahead of the game the job is a lot easier and the days go by faster, leading to pay day before you know it. Making it all worth it. If your willing to work hard and get compensated well for it this the job for you no doubt."
good,The pace is always fast there is always something to do and management is fairly reasonable. I was told several times to do certain containers and I worked them and got them done quickly and correctly. I was often recognized for my work and ability to help and still get done in a timely manner.
good,This was a fast pace work environment. the drivers are nice people and we always had work to do. there were some slow days but most of the time we had so much to do that it took all day.
good,"As a supervisor at one of the busiest hubs in the country, everyday was an exciting challenge to complete all assigned tasks at a proficient level while exceeding expectations of the managers which was required."
good,It’s a Great company and has very good employees. The supervisors keep us working to stay productive and are very helpful when you need them everything about the job is hands on.
good,"heard they hire 70% of temp hires and i didnt make the 70% with experience and i worked hard everyday very dissapointing, but what do you expect from a temporary position."
good,"Working at UPS is not a bad job, the union provides good job security and the job itself is not that hard. The night shift is where it is at, this will however ruin your social life."
good,"During my time at UPS, we once ran a slogan as the efficiency experts. You really need to be on your game as from the moment you walk in the door until you finish work, there is little room for error. Any error takes time to correct and you may not have that time before encountering another potential error."
good,"learned how to adapt to various scenarios, improved customer service skill , most enjoyable part of the job was being able to train employees and learn techniques from them as well."
good,Ase falta más trabajo en equipo y que den buen salario aun que sea contrato por agencia
good,It was a good job to work but not enough hours. It’s a slow pace job that allow you to have breaks through out hours of work. But the pay is awesome..
good,"They work with you and treat u fairly as long as your getting your work done and coming in on time, they make sure that the tasks they give you are something u can accomplish and not far fetched"
good,Working as a driver helper can either break or make you. You will never know the hours you will work. Some days you may not work. Work under all weather conditions.
good,"The ware house is super Dirty."
good,If your an early bird they have the perfect positions for you had fun working there would recommend it to most people but it’s not for everybody especially if you don’t like the cold lol
good,"mi evaluacion es buena, el trabajo es bueno, la compensacion es buena, el horario se podria mejorar, es un buen lugar para trabajar."
good,Need to follow all rules and safety of the company for the employees safety and the company security to work the company well acconrdingly to it's own restrictions.
good,This was a great seasonal job with good pay good exercise not much supervision as long as you are doing what you are supposed to be doing. Not much more to say
good,"The atmosphere is fast paced and structured. The Management was knowledgeable and I learned a lot about transportation and how it works from the inside perspective. I enjoyed most, the distance of the location from home.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the QA portion.  Having to meet the call adherences they require. The culture was good."
good,"What is that I just I loved it for the fact that I was helping the UPS driver deliver packages I was going to a  kind of houses,mansions, businesses.. Also going to different neighborhoods and different houses to deliver packages and I just loved it"
good,"Ottima cultura lavorativa, è sicuramente un'esperienza lavorativa da consigliare, adesso però dopo 10 anni mi piacerebbe cambiare"
good,Fairly uncomplicated with decent pay and good benefits. Open dress code and all about safety for the worker and everyone around. Like any job however it just depends on who's working with you the kind of experience you'll have
good,Great place to work for freshers but not after attaining a suitable experience because work pace decreases. Management doesn't have much  involvement in work/processes.
good,It is a very fun place very fast pass and it was a work out but you work with fun people it makes foing to work easier and it was morings so you had the rest of the say for yourself.
good,"If you need a good job while in school or just lookin for easy part time gig this is a good place to consider. Very good place indeed. Ok pay, its good enough for the work you do."
good,I like the pay but they don’t tell u the days u not getting paid. You suppose to get paid every week some people was working there for a month and did not get paid.
good,"I worked during peak season, so there was plenty of work to do. Gave opportunities to work in the warehouse to go along with helping the driver. Rules are set in place, all you have to do is follow them. Good pace job, good experience."
good,"UPS is a good job if your looking for some ''getting by money'' it's a easy check. The work is not that bad, its just a lot of moving and your always on your feet"
good,It’s cold sometimes in the winter but they have heaters and they do every thing they can’t to help employees. Everyone is very respect full and helpful
good,"This company provides good benefits and good pay. Worth working for. However, must have a degree or are pursuing one in order to advance within the company."
good,"The work is simple on paper, but management has no power due to the union. Employees are able to call out frequently and have no interest in their jobs"
good,Its a good job and has good benefits and has great pay with a nice safe and calm environment i liked it and im pretty sure you will to and its some good customers leave tips and food
good,"Ups is a Very generous and hard working work environment, They also care about all of their employees well being, it’s great pay and you can also move up"
good,"I worked as a driver helper for UPS during the 2019 peak season. I appreciated the flexibility, structure, and routine of the job. The job allowed me to do active work that serviced my community and I grew to appreciate all that the UPS drivers and the physical toll the job takes on their bodies."
good,Great fast paced work. Good pay and benefits. Good people and easy to learn work. Hardest part of the job is waking up. Must be fast and ready to work at all times.
good,"As an SPVD I got to drive my own vehicle, so I was very comfortable throughout the entire day. Overall the tasks were easy, and any complications usually had a simple resolution."
good,You will be worked hard everyday. They could never tell you if you were going to be working 8 hours everyday. most days we were working 10-12 hours Monday thru Friday.
good,it was a fun place to meet new people and learn stuff every day at work. everybody was helpful. there was a lot of to-dos but as the same time it wasn't hard.
good,Be flexible regarding start and finish times. Helps to anticipate that people may not care about their job which can make teamwork challenging occasionally.
good,I am a seasonal driver seeking permanent employment within the feeder Department. I obtained my CDL in May 2019 but the process to be considered for a permanent position seems discouraging.
good,The ups store is a great franchise to work for. not much room for career development but the one i worked at was very flexible with my school schedule
good,"I enjoyed interacting with the drivers and managment. "
good,There are some really great people that work here and they're easy to get along with.  You just have to work hard and do your best and you'll earn respect quickly.
good,"Management is great , awesome work enviroment ,   for the most part everyone gets along and helps each other. If you can't handle a fast pace job , this ain't the job for you."
good,"Considering the volume of work that flows through there, I found it to be organized and well communicated as to what needs to be done and it gets accomplished. Management is in touch throughout the course of operations with employees. Good sense of comradery between the entire staff. Work is physical but, there is also a need to be cognizant of what you are dong. In all I found it a good company to work for."
good,UPS is a great company for anyone looking for a job and intend on moving up in the company. UPS has many job opportunities for any field you could have gone to school for.
good,enjoyable workplace with strict safety rues to be followed. definetly not a job for someone who isnt ready to work out a little bit and break a sweat.
good,"the driver was very supportive made me quickly adjust to the process of scanning,sorting,identifying packages, unloading and  human relation involved."
good,"Being I was hired at what has been known as the ""peak"" season ."
good,The benefits and money are worth your hard work. Just need to be dedicated to the time you will put in. Otherwise it can get overwhelming if you aren't prepared for the high volume during holidays.
good,UPS is a great company if you can work there full time. The benefits are great and pay is decent if you are full time. The issue is in getting into the company and being able to be promoted from within.
good,UPS is fast paced consistent work evironment very good hard working people.is a great place to work time vary daily depend on the loads of the trucks.
good,"At my time working at UPS I would say the job was fairly good but certainly not for me. Each day consisted of loading many packages of all size and weight into a trailer. Management was good, always willing to help with what they can and give pointers to struggling employees. The hardest part of the job was having to constantly lift multiple heavy packages over my head while trying to work at a steady pace. While working there I learned to properly pace myself so I do not exhaust myself but also keep up with the steady work flow."
good,I have to wake up early each day to affirm that I am available to work. I am only able to work four days a week because “I am not needed.” There are ZERO breaks on the job during peak season. Not even a 15 min break. Bring snacks that you can shove down your throat because you will be hungry after you run your behind off. Its a fun and exhausting job that makes time fly by.
good,"It was an ok place to work at....I enjoyed the co-workers but some of the supervisors were treated some of us like robots"
good,"it was alright. its what a typical warehouse environment is. you know, the typical “get paid to practically work out!” you literally just like stack boxes neatly and if you start slacking behind you can potentially ruin the flow of the whole building"
good,"Hard work but a good seasonal job that paid weekly... You will have a workout everyday, your going to meet up with your driver and deliver all packages..."
good,"produtive and fun workplace, i was so excited to work on web applications and mobile applications. it is pleasure to work with UPS interms of enhancing my kills"
good,"Sales, marketing, operation of export process , operation of import process,customs clearness and customer services , handling of all the VIP files, dealing with the airline co. Dealing the cargo process"
good,It was a good job for winter break. I was busy and they gave me a bonus for the extra time I put in. Each day I would text in my availability and each I would accept a new job driver and location to work with .
good,"I can learn really fast dedicated hard worker "
good,They train you for like a week before they put u inside the warehouse and from there you get a personal grainier who teaches you the right way to do the work for like a week and from there you can start working alone
good,"UPS has a very fast paced work environment that I grew to enjoy. Furthermore, they encourage education as well as have great benefits. If you are looking to work for a company that will not interrupt your home life while having the support of your employer in other areas that matter in your life, UPS is the place to work."
good,Excellent salary and benefits.  Tough hours.  I enjoyed working at UPS.  It was a great opportunity in my life.  I have a small child and could not manage the long hours as a single father.
good,I am happy with UPS just started training and hope to be full time with them soon. I wish i had more notice on the days I work but happy to be working too.
good,"It was a great place to work at, I had one complaint it's pretty small and that is that I was always sore after a shift or even the next day, remember to stretch before you work."
good,Was a good second job to work in the holiday season. It was very chaotic but at the end of the work shift everything always got done. Would love to work there again.
good,"UPS is a very nice place to work. The team works really hard, but they always have time to have fun."
good,"Gezellige werkomgeving, verder is de werksfeer ook niet gespannen."
good,UPS is stocked with great people. I have not come across one person I don't enjoy working with. It is great to see the diversity and quality of the people who work at UPS
good,I worked as a walker for the fall season till the holidays to help pay for school in the winter term. It had good hours and I had a great supervisor/driver who was great to work with.
good,"this job is good start off for a new working individual...working for UPS is like working for Trump, you will never know what will happen till it does."
good,"I am willing to work warehouse jobs. I am aware of the conditions, especially during seasonal changes. I Have experience from working with UPS. I am aware of the qualifications."
good,The work culture in my place if work is that they work hard for a little bit but then they start to get lazy as time goes on and stuck in old way of working
good,mise en place de véhicule poids lourd sur site de nuit comme de jours
good,Very nice pay I wouldn’t change that just to be seasonal. The people are nice and everybody helps each other. I like that it is early shift cause you can relax and get more done through out the day.
good,I learned how to work with people who may seem hard to work with. I also learned how to get my job done and help out anyone who needed help. I learned how to take directions from my supervisor and do what I had to do.
good,UPS was a good place to work an had fun but the management is not the best and scheduling was also not the best. all in all it was a job that payed the bills
good,Working at UPS was good I like physical jobs they make sure you are hard working & you have to come in with a good attitude or you won’t finish right.
good,Fun and fast pace seasonal work. Would indeed like to apply in the packaging department. Seasonal helper is ideal as well. I was lucky enough to be consistently with great experienced driver. We worked well as a team.
good,"It really reqiures dedication to work, a very busy environment "
good,"Expectations are extremely high for job production in any part of the company. Great wage and medical insurance, but there is premium paid with the loss of quality of home and family time."
good,Overall it’s a great part time job for someone who doesn’t mind hard labor and sweating. I honestly loved it beside all the bruises and cuts from lifting and picking up heavy boxes. Very hard to remember the sorting chart they need a better system to where you don’t have to think about where the number goes and have it color coded. Really cool people!
good,"I learned to sort packages and different area codes to seperate outgoing in packages in sorting. I worked the docs loading and unloading trucks, I was efficient in all my areas. Hard work but worth it. this was union with teamsters."
good,Pas assez d'attention envers leurs chauffeurs l'embauche est au bon vouloir du chef d'équipe et non de la RH si ta tête ne revient pas au chef d'équipe tu ne pourras pas être embauché même si tu es un bon et excellent travailleur je suis déçu de cette expérience mets Ups reste une très bonne entreprise
good,"Per UPS website:"
good,Loved it! Want to go again this season already emailed the person who hired me last year. Fingers crossed I get the call to work again. I also interviewed for a freight position in August but was not selected.
good,If you want to drive make you let them know. Work is a little strenuous but heard they lightened the load since August. Tough work probably not worth if your not going to drive
good,"Métier dur et interressant à la fois, qui permet de voir le processus d'une livraison de colis."
good,"J'ai était très ravi d'avoir travaillé 11ans chez UPS , je me suis enrichie d'expériences dans le domaine du transport."
good,UPS has had all the old timers retire and the new breed has NO EXPERIENCE and they are allowing this group to lead the company. Personal Appearance standards have gone down. The vehicles don’t get washed daily. There is no pride in work and nobody is doing anything about it. However they do pay well and there is a lot of work. It’s just stressful and frustrating!
good,See above... Not enough hours to live off wage. So tired after shift hard to have another job. Insane expectations especially during peak season. Union benefits but there's so much seniority that you could be stuck in same pt job for years.
good,"Pay was a little low, but the employees were fun to work with. Nice team environment. Snacks are  brought in routinely and left for everyone in the break room."
good,"I worked by myself for long hours without help. Putting mail away, sorting packages, wrapping and packaging boxes, customers are very rude for shipping costs and demand free packaging for Amazon return labels when their supposed to keep their boxes."
good,Ups is a magnificent place to work with competitive pay. A diverse of people that get along real well. Extremely fast pace environment with heavy lifting everyday.
good,"It's a great job if you are a student, you have the ability to get the tuition reimbursement and early hours. Do not expect to make a great living if you are part time (which you probably are) it takes years to become full time. Overall not a stressful jobs just use your legs, you only have one back,"
good,"Es una empresa muy grande, pero con una cultura muy vieja, con protocolos que permiten gerentes y colaboradores sin ningun tipo de desarrollo de personal, donde solo les interesan los resultados"
good,working there it wasn't that bad however I was working night shift in which messed with my sleep schedule so that's why I had to leave. I'm currently looking for a better job now
good,It's a fun place to work but sometimes it gets busy and you would have been on top of your game but I would recommend working at UPS. This was my first place of work and I really enjoyed connecting with the costumers and had a fun time working with the employees.
good,"it was ok but if you’re looking for something to keep you interested and refreshed, don’t work here also, keep in mind that their bonuses change so your pay may fluctuate"
good,"I love the fact that you get full time benefits, even though I was partime. I never had to work on the weekends, plus I was paid everyday. The one thing that I did hate, was the payments to the union"
good,"UPS is cool if you absolutely need a job with benefits, but other than that it’s not worth it. I’m 19 years old and I have back issues that some 40 year olds don’t even have, I’m constantly exhausted from it and it’s very stressful and demanding."
good,"A very reliable job, pay is good, weekly-biweekly attendance bonuses, weekly pay, dependable hours with many opportunities to advance in your carreer and opportunities for school reimbursement"
good,Working at the  UPS Store is to see a kaleidoscope of people from every walk of life. We all work together to give the best possible customer service.
good,• Following packing label to ensure parcels are on the correct trucks • Lifting and sliding packages weighing up to 150 pounds on to convey belts • Insured packages are moved with quality and the customers satisfaction.
good,Very fasted paced but also a fun experience I love to work in a warehouse so it wasn’t a problem to me and it’s a great team effort.it helps you work well with others
good,It’s good if you need money and don’t mind working third shift  if you like third shift this job isn’t that bad  I used it as part time to go to uofl to get free tuition
good,"Entreprise avec une bonne ambiance globale, il y a toujours du travail ce qui est assez positif."
good,If you ever wondered what working on a plantation is like then this job may be for you.  The management approach tends to be much like that of an  overseer on a Southern plantation.  The management style is one of  constant intimidation!  You will either work until you drop or you will not make it here.
good,"Long days hard work decent pay teach you a lot about holding people accountable and follow up, to trust and verify. Rewarding on many levels hardest part is the life work balance."
good,"Great stable job although there is a lot of favoritism within the company, promotions are selected and give out to the individuals that are most liked instead of those who work hard and actually deserve them."
good,"very fast paced, communication is key and a hard work ethic."
good,Very fast paced. Delivered 1000's of packages daily. My body was extremely sore afterwards. I was using muscles that I never have before. The packages are loaded into the truck by package handlers and because of the high volume they were not sorted into the correct locations making it very hard to locate where the package was in the truck. At times we delivered to the same location mulitable times throughout the day. We worked way late in the night until around 11:00 p.m. Their system seemed very unproductive.
good,I love my job here at UPS the only thing I would change is to make more room for avancment or at least a raise/some benefits for temp to permemat employee after 90 days.
good,It was a good work experience and great working environment. I worked as a package loader. I started off as a holiday helper and end up full-time worker.
good,"Plan on working two jobs if you are trying to afford a house, not many hours a day, great for a college student, they offer great incentives.  Health insurance was free"
good,It was a great job and I I was in a good space with everybody working there it was a easy job after I learned wat I had to do I really liked the job and if it wasn't seasonal I would have stayed on that job
good,"Very fast pace and hard work for less than fair pay , seasonal employees are very under paid. Breaks are 10 mins every 4 hours . You will sweat in a truck or on the conveyor belt lines in winter you are moving so fast , and management drives you all shift ."
good,I loved working at ups i made  some new friends and it was a type  of work that I enjoyed going from truck to truck and working fast paced and seeing who could load the most between my freinds
good,UPS is a wonderful company to work for. I have been there for quite sometime now. They have great benefits. from time off to employee discounts and 401 benefits and much much more.
good,"Handling logistics of shipping, packing, and receiving of packages was an experience I'm grateful for. Everyday you meet somebody new and help them in a multitude of ways."
good,"Loading and unloading packages was easy, simply got to listen to music and do your work without much intervention by supervisor. The other employees were friendly and easy to get along with."
good,"Fast paced environment. You got to have Holidays off which was one of the best parts of working their. Not all Managers were the same, some didn't know what they were doing."
good,I worked as a Packer. In the peak season. Not for the weak but if your looking for some winter cash and can manege fast pased work i would defiantly take
good,"Es ist ein harter Job, aber effektiv um Selbstständigkeit zu erlernen."
good,Its fun an fast pace and love to have the rest of my day to myself to take care of business. Then You wake up and do it all over again. I wish I would of applied to ups sooner.
good,Helping deliver propel dreams was a really fun experience for me and meet new people was also a fun experience. The hard part was stand in the the winter .
good,Best seasonal job ever cant wait to go back at the end of the year and the staff and supervisor are encouraging and help you want to move up in positions as long as you do what you gotta do in the company
good,"You work constantly non stop , if you hurt yourself on the job they take it personally and will not promote you , and possibly let you go when the seasonal hires come."
good,You shore up really early and you leave late so be ready to put some OT in for the holidays. Need special attention to detail also to help you get through the day.
good,Was fun working as package handler. Looked at the job as a work out. Management was a little leery. Was nice to get paid every week. Very redundant job.
good,"Excellent work ethic, nice people, a very good supervision staff, hr department and all the staff. Good trainers. Not everyone can survive but only the people with good work ethic can."
good,"It Was Seasonal Work So You Don't Qualify For Benefits.The Truck Drivers Really Get The Best Pay.I Felt Like The Package Handlers Did The Most Work And Should Have More Money!"
good,"Honestly, it was a really hard job. I worked from 3-9 am and while the time did go fast because they let us listen to music, they constantly were on my neck about moving faster despite me only being there for my first month. Nonetheless, it was a good job if you could keep up with the pace and management."
good,"Some days were harder then others with the amount of packages come through the warehouse, Overall I got along with coworkers and mangers.Climate sucks"
good,My colleagues were very good too me and so were the managers. We were allowed to work on flexible terms. The environment was fast paced but fun to work in
good,"UPS is a fast pace and physically demanding part time job. Although the hour are short per day, you also have a secure 5 days a week pays, and as well as additional raises every six mouths. While giving insurance benefits after a year of working, with paid vacations."
good,"Over all ups is it good place to work. The pay is good, you do get a lot  during peak season. it is a fast paced place. Good place to work at if you want to get a workout."
good,"Working as an engineering supervisor at UPS is an incredible opportunity to develop your breadth of perspective as you are given the freedom to work with all different departments; coordinating, communicating, and executing to the business plan."
good,It was easier to work with people who make it easy for your job to be enjoyable and easy. I never had a really bad day. I always made sure my station was cleaned up and tidy all the time.
good,"It can be difficult working in the warehouse due to weather conditions but can be rewarding with pay and great work out. 50 cent raise yearly and you will be part of a union which is difficult to find as a entry level employee. My main job function was to make sure employees were using proper lifting practices, staying hydrated and teaching them about nutrition and fitness."
good,UPS is a great place to work. The company takes pride in the brand and is  one of the hardest places to get a job at in the US. They have great culture
good,UPS is a great place to work. They have excellent benefits and truly care for the health and well being of their employees............................
good,A job that keeps you moving at a steady pace. On average you are moving between 700 to 1300 packages per hour. It's a great job if you are wanting to be more active.
good,Ama disiplinli kaliteli bir kurum isimden memnunum arta kalan zamanimi degerlendirmek istiyom
good,"You have to come to work everyday to work, it's fast pace environment, and time flies really fast. packages range from 2lbs to 150lbs, so you really have to have some knowledge of lifting."
good,"During my seasonal employment at UPS as a Driver Helper I was able to strengthen my customer service attributes, as well as unloading and loading skills."
good,it would be very hot inside the trailers and the fans wouldn't really do much unless you are close to them the packages could come at rapid speeds and you will have a hard day or come slow and you will have a easy day but you only get one 10 minute break and no lunch.
good,"I worked there while I was in college, it did the job but I was looking for more. They have great benefits and you can really go far with company if you choose too."
good,I am disappointed that the retroactive pay promised is not being paid. They paid me $11/hour promising it would be $13 and that I would be paid the difference when the union contract was approved. My driver has been paid his but I think I have been lied to. It is about $300 and I will follow up without ceasing.
good,delivering 300 packages a day and also picking u 100 a day by 8pm everyday. you had to move fast in the winter to stay warm but in the summer time pace yourself so you do not end up exerting yourself. met a lot of great people being located in the upper-east side of Manhattan. worth the experience.
good,"Working at the UPS store gave me the experience with dealing with customers and creating superb finished work. I learned about graphic design, different types of paper, outsourcing jobs and how such a large business works."
good,A great experience to have early on or at some point in your life. It's hard work and gets VERY crazy during the holidays. You might get sick of seeing cardboard at some point.
good,I liked working there because you have so much opportunity for growth within the company.  You can move up positions pretty quickly. And the work is easy. There is some lifting involved
good,I enjoyed my seasonal at ups i would love to return again. The pay coworkers & management were all good! They even supply snacks or pizza once in awhile for our great work!
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was not really expected for a young girl my age to work there and actually enjoy it but it was a very active hard labor job that kept me moving and on my feel at all times. you have to be very attentive and quick at learning to grow and strive in this work environment to be able to reach being there for a while."
good,Dans cette entreprise on travail dans la bonne humeur
good,"Typical day was to check packages and make sure the information in the computer matched what was n the package, would take of invoices the package and key it in the system and run reports at the end of the day."
good,"Load the trucks up with boxes , learned how to work at a fast pace , hot and sweaty , workout kind of job , hardest part of my job is loading up multiple trucks and lifting heavy items"
good,"This is a job that could also be a considered as a career. UPS certifies employees on various PIT machines (stand up and sit down forklifts). There’s also multiple positions available here to learn and grow with, such as becoming a local or cdl driver."
good,"The benefits are great and the pay is ok. The hours are not that great. The shifts are quick, only about 4 hours per day but usually early in the morning. "
good,Great atmosphere but things constantly get real hectic. In order to advance in the warehouse you must move quickly efficiently and you must be very compliant.
good,"It was not as bad as I thought it would be. The work and pay didn’t add up but the management was cool. Customers didn’t give a hard time, the environment was more laid back and somedays in a faster pace. Very balanced."
good,I only had worked at UPS during the year and peak season at Laureton it was a great experience the favouritism is the only thing I have issue with as a temporary worker.
good,"I worked for UPS for about 2 months between the months of November and December of 2018. To cut it short there was no real benefits, or bonuses in my sector. Just straight hourly pay, management was a bit wonky, but straight forward. Just as long as you did your job correctly they wouldnt bother you. But transportation is definitely heavily necessary for this position."
good,Would have liked if the managers have provided job opportunities to the seasonal employees they had good reviews from drivers they worked with to be offered full time employment.
good,"I have been at ups close to 18years.The only issues I have is the lack of consistency with the hours.The hardest part working at the job is when we have extra packages and short of people.We do happen to have some great supervisors,along with some incompetent one."
good,"Tba"
good,"Job is great for a hard worker, they will help you to advance, and give you plenty of opportunity to get hours. Buildings are a bit filthy and dark though. Very physical labor. If you go supervisor route, can be stressful."
good,This job got me through college. They only have part time positions available and the shifts fit perfectly with my college schedule. This job will is very physical and will help you develop discipline.
good,I enjoyed my time with UPS. It was a fast-paced job that made me appreciate the work of UPS employees.  Riding in the truck making stops was exciting and made the day go by quickly.
good,It was a good job while going to college and now I am looking for something that fits my degree in engineering.... I would recommend this job to a person fresh out of high school.   Good job experience
good,"good company to work for but if you can deal with management always on your back about every minute of the day, once you are off the on call list it gets better but you will be working nights for a long time."
good,Just with how much you end up getting paid you would want a 2nd job unless you have a spouse/SO. Great otherwise full of awesome benefits. Job isn't too hard but physical and self-paced mostly.
good,"Starting out was very stressful but once you get the hang of it it becomes easier. You won’t leave with a dry shirt at all, I’ve been there a year and still leave sweaty, but it’s a good job with great benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being assigned to our trucks, & scanning the UPC code on boxes as we loaded them onto the truck from the conveyor belt. I learned how to properly load boxes onto the truck.The hardest part of the job, is lifting heavy boxes.The most enjoyable part of the job, was finally getting the truck loaded."
good,"So, I can't really speak on how a full-time employee would benefit from the job. But, from the time I was there it was easy enough to do. You pretty much go to the same neighborhoods and businesses everyday, and you can switch up your route whenever you want so you don't get so bored. But, it's pretty much the same areas on a daily basis. "
good,You have to work at UPS speed. As a former manager I know this and directed my employees to do the same. I have been in a union position so essentially I know what it takes to be successful.
good,They have great medical insurance. You will be part of a Union. It's an intense job your on your feet for 5 hours a day. There is room for growth within the company.
good,Obtain a shuttle bus year round not just for seasonal work it felt as if we where used just for seasonal work once told we were being hired full time made no sence telling them they have the position when transportation no longer available
good,Personally I loved it but they have some days where it can be really hard depending where they place you. It is super fast paced and you will lose weight for sure. Many of the supervisors are really cool and great to get along with.
good,"The trucks were dark and cold, was shown a pattern to unload packages, they had to be unloaded per training."
good,"The job it tough physically, Quick paced, and only one 10 min break. The jobs benifits are great but the pay could be better. I like the managers and my co-workers."
good,I enjoyed my time working at UPS. It was a good seasonal job for the winter along with the pay that came with it. I made great friends while working there and would recommend it to anyone who just wants to work during the holiday season.
good,"I been at UPS for over ten years plus, with excellent health care benefits for families working only part time hours. Plus you can go to college and finish your degree is optional. Take advantage of what you can do for a great company."
good,Not the worst place I've worked at. Pretty easy job. The worst part about working for The UPS Store is the occasional difficult customer and the pay could be higher.
good,"Stressful company to work for. They micro manage you, but the pay was good. I worked nights with no hope of getting a day job there. Very fasted place company. You are reviewed at your job quarterly."
good,It's fast-paced physically hard job but I enjoy the people I work with and it's easier than most might think when they first start so if you're able to get through the first few weeks or month after that it's a nice job good benefits and pays well
good,"I got hired on because my aunt worked there and I needed a job. I got assigned to three trucks that I had to fill before a certain time. All you do is walk up to the cages, grab a couple boxes, read the label and put them in the right truck on the right shelf. I had a hard time sorting onto the correct trucks. I got a lot ob bruises on my legs from moving heavy boxes. I got in great shape and didn't mind being dirty when i got home."
good,"I  enjoyed working for UPS.  It is very difficult to be employed with them.  Every time that I apply for a job, Personnel would always offer a package handling position."
good,"I'm a supervisor now but I started in the unload, work can be hard, fast paced, and sometimes overwhelming in the beginning. Once you get settled into the job it becomes easy and it's always possible to be promoted if your willing to work hard for it"
good,"I began working at the Bluegrass Location as a package handler and enjoyed the small facility and camaraderie. We were given snacks twice per week and during peak season we had catered food almost every day. "
good,A typical day at UPS is fast-paced and extremely punctual.  Every minute counts when facilitating the direction of companies merchandize. The workplace culture is carelessness is costly and unacceptable.
good,They can do better I notice that this companies expect great things consistently from employees however not willing to pay the descent amount of wages that are deserved.
good,I've been with UPS for almost 5 years. I started at a part-time employee and the now I'm a front line supervisor. It is good money and great benefits.
good,"management, training and developing new hires, audit ready and mentoring for employee certification. team leadership for collogues, production goals and meeting customer service."
good,"-Great company with benefits"
good,"Great work environment. However, there needs to be more dynamics to the work environment or else you will be working monotonously. Will get to meet a lot of people with similar backgrounds!"
good,"It was a fast paced, competitive job but work the pay. 10 minute snack break with medium hard labor. There were packages over 100 lbs but assistance was always provided by coworkers."
good,"I was a seasonal driver helper in San Fransisco, CA and i enjoyed it very much up until the season was over. I applied to be a package handler and i would love to continue working for them, but you can't always get what you want. Not everyone wants a young able bodied guy that is completely dedicated to his work and would be reliable, but hey that's on them."
good,"Good place to work with excellent benefits, good people that are dependable, must be able to with stand changing weather conditions, excellent bennefits"
good,"UPS was an alright job to work at, managers were easy to get along with, working nights was cool cause didn't have to deal with the sun but when it got cold outside oh you felt it inside. the work was heavy and it was loud but it was pretty good all things considered"
good,"Ups was a very competitive company. I truly learned how to manage any situation and was able to get people to work willing for me. unfortunately the hours were a little to much, was unable to have any personal time"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at UPS. They offer room for advancement and they have a great tuition reimbursement plan. I would recommend the company to a young person just starting out, they offer room to grow."
good,If you are a person that want to really grow within the supply delivery industry. This is the position for you. They have tons classes and mentoring to expand your skills.
good,"union vs management. if you are content with no responsibilities you can come to work every day, move packages, and you'll climb the pay scale. if you seek management and really apply yourself and be aware that minutes matter.. then you can climb the ladder. you don't get promoted because you're liked, you get promoted because you can drive results."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. It' unfortunate that it was only a temporary position. It was interesting to be a delivery driver, especially because some of the stops on my route were hard to get too. And the cliche about dogs and delivery drivers is true."
good,Very stressful place to work and management is very harsh. Very strict working force could be fun at times unless like I said manger issues. But besides that very cool place.
good,"Pros"
good,I would unload trailers for 5 hours a day. I also would sometimes go to pack small stuff and put them in a bag. The hardest part about the job is the stuff that's over 70 pounds.
good,"There is always something to learn at ups. Every day I learn something new. The greatest thing about working for UPS is their benefit program for its emplyees. 401k, health insurance, a great amount of PTO, among others. The compensation isn't nearly up to par with the industry, but the benefits are what have kept me there."
good,"While some workers experience heavier loads, and some may make careers out of it. However it is not for everyone, the overall experience is adequate, and only recommended as a part time position. It is a heavy team oriented environment, a few find themselves burnt out quickly which cause a chain reaction where it would affect others."
good,"Busy and unorganized. I learned alot about self control, team building. The hardest part of the job is the hours, lack of trained staff (that can be overwhelming). The most enjoyable part is when there is a successful day and your drivers come off the road safe."
good,"The time I spent at UPS was a seasonal job, they work you to death, but I will say the pay is decent and the time you spend there you will lose weight if you keep working there, not a bad place overall."
good,"It is a fun job if you like to move around a lot. It pays well if you are there for a long period of time. It is not very mentally engaging though, which is not supposed to be."
good,Learning how to scan and load and unload trucks packaging and loading the trucks for the drivers at a fast pace each and every day. Being very organized and helping to get the community there items
good,"Honest work, show up and clock in. We usually started off stopping by all the businesses from 12-3pm and ended the night from 3-9pm doing residential deliveries. Fast paced enjoyable work."
good,Sehr guter Arbeitgeber und die Atmosphere ist super. Wer möchte ungern direct am Strand arbeiten:)
good,"Liberal time off, good benefits, union representation so they can't overly jerk you around, and some work from home opportunity. Not a bad place to wrap up a career after 35 years somewhere else."
good,This job is a good benefit job more manual labor work but overall a nice solid job but with me being part time they cut my hours tremendously so I’m looking for another job to go with it.
good,"Great job, but it is labor intensive. So if anyone would plan. On working for them, definitely have a strong back. I worked for 2 years and what I left with was a sore lower back."
good,I like working there I have been there for 21 years and have unloaded truck loaded trucks and now I am a clerk and have learned many things from clerking to loading truck
good,It was ok just make sure you know what your getting paid up front. Be prepared for the weather and get ready to walk alot which is a good thing. But overall a good job
good,Youre in a trailer by yourself load or unloading semi trailers with 600-800 packages in a safe manner. Many ways to get injured in there if youre not careful.
good,"With benefits changing and people in management being close minded, it is hurting the future of UPS. A lot if individuals in higher up positions are concerned of the past and don't think about the future and how the world is changing. UPS is becoming more reactive than proactive."
good,I wouldnt recommend anybody i know Or anybody in general to work there. The supervisors there are idiots and pick favorites and when you need help with something they don’t help.
good,Fast working pace throughout the entire work hours. Typical days will start off slow and gradually become more quicker pace as the day starts coming to an end.
good,"UPS was a great place to work for me at the time. I never got into senior level management, so my opinion might be different had I gotten there as they work insane amounts of hours."
good,Each The UPS Store is autonomous. The UPS Store in Fulton has an owner / operator who encourages individuals to contact him for any problem solving. Does not encourage promotions or growth. Does not give raises
good,Very good company just wish i could have had more hours. I also like the fact they help with college tution. It was very busy but managers also gave a hand helping out
good,"We worked directly with UPS, but we were not affiliated with UPS Corporate. I worked for The UPS Store, which is a franchise model. It was originally Mailboxes Etc. , that was then purchased by UPS Corporate, but they did minimal interference with the Store Owners / Proprietors. It was interesting to meet people from all walks of life, and especially international shipments."
good,A very tough work environment but you must do your best to adapt to it in order to get the job done. water was sometimes provided plus there are water fountains.
good,"Every one helped each other complete the work. Fast paced and some heavy lifting, but not difficult. Enjoyed the atmosphere and early hours. Depending on your work ethic they will place you on a priority list for the next season or if there's openings."
good,Go to work load truck and deliver packages until truck is empty .Fast pace and lots of walking no matter what the outside weather is.Typical day can be into the night depending on number of packages that need to be delivered.Holidays are the hardest time of the year.
good,Everyday is a busy day at UPS. The communication is a must at this company together with the teamwork. All the employees are engaged with the company mission being easy the internal-departmental collaboration.
good,"If you don't mind getting up very earlier and being treated like army recruits, this the place for you.  Management never on the same page.  Benefits is also if you wait a year."
good,The UPS management team requires excessive hours that exceed a standard 40 hour week.  The job involves hard work and high stress in order to meet the demands of the customer.
good,"Delivering for UPS very busy. In and Out of Delivery vehicle, organizing packages to be delivered. Some packages very heavy, hand truck available to deliver packages. Drivers very nice and happy to have you there to assist them."
good,Within the operation of UPS it runs through organized chaos. It works but there needs to be a full commitment from everyone. UPS offers great benefits and great wages especially for college students. It is a great path to lead yourself into a professional career. Through all the chaos it will help develop someone who can make a quick decision with little to no information.
good,"Fast paced, physically demanding job. The drivers are all very nice. They know what they are doing. This is not the job for you if you like to work at a slow pace."
good,"UPSCS is the typical expectation of a corporation."
good,"The designs of the chutes are made in way where they are facing each other, so boxes jam up right away. I am constantly loading a couple of boxes before I have to break the jam again."
good,It was pretty much okay . Jus have to be ready to work and able to move at fast pace . It’s really warehouse so they work you to the bone . You definitely get tired you sweat all of the above . Jus come to work ready to work .
good,"Good Benefits for part time work.  They provide health insurance at no additional cost, a 401k, and pension options.  The hours were good for me at the time, early morning."
good,Ups franchise stores such as the one I worked for are not directly under Ups. I did love the store I worked for! Sadly the store owner decided to sell so it was time I mobe on to find a job with benefits and more promotional options.
good,"The insurance is great, even if it is low pay. However, the low hours and variable income between summer (very high) and winter (very low) can make it hard to use it for much. Drivers (not me) make a better living, though they hire from within so you'll have to work your way up form a bit low on the chain. It is questionable how each day and the rest of the week will go; though it usually tougher on mondays and tuesdays. You'll need some adjustment period to start out thanks to the fast-paced, high-functioning amount of physical work required; though your ability to keep it up might vary. Most peers keep with the team spirit and help each other as needed."
good,UPS is a overall very good company to work for. However there can be politics behind the scenes in local sort upper management that can at times cause/allow a hostile work environment without consequence to the manager being reported for doing so.
good,you work 4-5 hours a night moving volume. This is a fast paced environment because packages have to be out by a certain deadline. You get a 10 minute paid break a night.
good,Not a bad place to work. Need more jobs to go to when contracts are lost. They treat you fairly as a whole but management need to help drivers with locations to continue working.
good,Great place to work. I was there for couple months and i enjoyed it. You meet great people there. The supervisors are great people. They offer some kind of financial aid for people in school
good,"The job was very laid back with very few days of high stress. Management was helpful and the clientele was also nice. The job mostly consisted of scanning packages in and out, with a few shipments made here and there."
good,Really fast-paced and energetic environment everyday. Basically getting paid to workout. Only worked part time so i didn't utilize the benefits available
good,The job was really boring it was the same thing every si hole day. Managers can be very rude at times. They get strict on how you packthe truck training doesn’t teach much other than toxic chemical awareness.
good,fast-paced when there's work good learning experience and paid training when slow-season hits work slows down  but overall nice place to work and as a stepping stone
good,"Great boss and hours. they pay wasn't all that great for office work but the environment was laid back and relaxed. Great employees made the job even more fun,"
good,A typical work day at UPS was quite easy. It is a laid back environment with some what flexible hours. they will work with you if you have another job
good,"I enjoy my job at UPS, but feel it is time to look for another do to management's inability to secure a safe work environment. Faster isn't always better."
good,"A typical day working at UPS is a day full of hard work. I have learned how to lift heavy boxes the correct way, which i find to be very important thing to learn about that job title.Management was very friendly and helpful. The work place is very busy and fast pace. The hardest part about the job for me was fast pace but once i got the flow of things I had no problems after that. The most enjoyable part about the job was the fulfillment of feelingl like i got a workout at work."
good,I would still be working for UPS but I was working 3 jobs 7 days a week to try and keep my seniority as a driver. There is too much uncertainty when it comes to UPS and driving. If you're not a swing driver with high seniority or you already have your own route then your salary will vary week to week. You may drive an entire week and then once in one week. Once they lost Amazon in 2016 the volume went way down and it was too hard to get routes with the seniority I had so I had to part ways financially.
good,Fun and great learning experience with the opportunity to meet new people and build customer relationships. The company provided many online courses to receive certifications and training.
good,UPS is a great job to make money over a school break as well as experience physical labor.  It holds a great reputation and many long-term benefits for people that choose to stay on board.
good,"First thing in the morning you make sure you have bags on the line and thy are opened for the packages to fall into. When the bag is full you print the label and put it on the bag and put the bag on the belt, for it to go to be put on the plane ."
good,Working in the warehouse had its downfall.  I worked around a lot of men and sometimes it was very uncomfortable.  I had to monitor all the packages off the trucks and log into the system data base.  I was around men all the time and some were not nice.
good,Mostly all i was told when working there was to go as fast as possible. They always were on the driver and myself for speed. The driver I was paired with on the other hand was a very respectful and helpful coworker.
good,I enjoyed working  with my co-workers.  Management was a mixed bag.  Sometimes great and other times not very much.  Location was very convenient for me.  Working with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Being coached to sound scripted was the least favorite part.
good,"working for u.p.s  for over 23 years, for the most part was a lot of fun, there were days that were crazy, but for the most part, I had fun with most of the people I worked with."
good,"I worked for several years seasonally as a ""jumper"", riding ""on car"" with a driver. For 2 years I had my own route with a Subaru EZ go, a trailer and a ""pod"" which was filled every morning. Enjoyable outdoors job, can get very busy, cold, hot, wet.. you name it. All drivers I worked with were great people."
good,Loved going out on the job offsite with the driver on deliveries and learning new skills. I also liked that transportation  was provided.. what I dont like us not getting lunch as needed.
good,I did seasonal work as a driver helper for 11$ an hour. You get paid a lot more as a driver which is what I am hoping for eventually but I did not get that job yet
good,It was a very fast paced day. I pre-loaded trucks and packaged handled. There was a lot of multitasking involved. My staff and I were team players. I gained more experience in multi-tasking and working in a fast paced environment.
good,had some good days had some horrible days. management is good.. some of the people you work with is okay and some are not.. everyone different but i had a good experience working with them
good,UPS was great to work if you don't mind manual labor. I loved what I did and got promoted quickly. However after a year of not getting a raise that we were supposed to get I left.
good,"Since my time there was through an agency I can’t really give a review as an actual employee but for what it’s worth it’s a really easy job. You’re indoors, there’s several shifts for any schedule and the job is really simple. This would be a good place for people in high school who need experience."
good,Fast pace place of work. Learned new skills when it comes to delivering. Also learned how to use new technology that makes the delivering process more efficient. The hardest part of the job would be getting the hang of the routes and being able to complete them in a reasonable time. The most enjoyable part of the job is being outdoors and the ability to work at your own pace.
good,Seasonal Driver to hopefully be called back. It was not a hard job to do other than getting to know the streets in your area and the flow of house numbers.
good,I am a college student and I could always count on UPS to make sure I was able to buy the things I needed ( weekly pay). My supervisors were always very nice to me.
good,UPS is a physical working wearhouse with a lot of heavy boxes that we gotta load unload and sort. The place itself was stressful but the pay was very good to have every week to help your bills out.
good,Fast paced with high expectation of completing deliveries and pickups.  Helpful environment and great co-workers willingness to help out. Very hands on and learning on the fly.
good,"I was a seasonal driver helper/jumper during their peak season in December.  I liked the fast paced work and would gladly do it again.  The job requires stamina, efficiency, communication skills, and excellent customer service."
good,everyone was very friendly and helpful during training and the drivers I worked with were very courteous and respectful of myself as a worker and their customers.
good,I liked it a lot. I had a really great experience working for the company during the winter holiday. The person I was helping was a really great lady and it was awesome.
good,There are many different divisions of the company known as United Parcel Service (UPS).  My experience with UPS comes from the Supply Chain Solutions branch.
good,"If you enjoy exercise, a fast-paced work environment, and friendly interaction with customers, this is a good seasonal work opportunity. Though the number of hours you wok can vary substantially from day to day, depending on delivery volume."
good,Seasonal helper jobs are a great opportunity to make money during the holiday season for recent high school graduates or someone looking for a foot in the door at UPS.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, they pay well and have amazing benefits. The trade off for that is the hours you work can easily hit 45+ a week. If you are looking for a strait 9-5 job this isn't for you. The hours are long and the work is hard. If you don't mind that the I'd say go for it."
good,A fast pace job. Time management is a skill you need to master to make the job easier. The pay and benifits are good. hard to get on full time. There are long hours.
good,"As with any job, the peak season is incredibly stressful, very great people, but the hours are mediocre with the work-life balance, and I found compensation to be lackluster."
good,"Great place to work in college, the benefits were great.  Must be fit and have a strong work ethic. Worked the early morning shift from 4 to 7 am.  Great place to work."
good,this was a seasonal job were I went with the ups driver to deliver packages to places of work and resentences and would be on a time schedule to keep.
good,"quick moving, a lot of hours, good management, good pay, fun job! They were a great productive place to work, cool people to work with and great benefits."
good,If you like physical work and plan to stay somewhere for an extended period of time it is worth it. It is union work so you'll need to stay in the company to reap the rewards of contract progression.
good,"It is very hard work, but the pay and benefits are amazing.  You can move up in the company if you work hard. It can be stressful at times, but if you have a positive attitude, you can deal with the stress."
good,Would help the driver deliver packages either to business or residential areas. Would also help organize the packages in order inside the trucks to have the rest of the ride going smoothly.
good,"When I first started working there like any other jobs, I was handling all the heavy weight. literally. Some of the management (supervisors) did not do their job very well. I would work there maybe at a different location or different position."
good,UPS driver is a very strenuous position requiring long hours especially during peak season 4th Quarter of each year. drivers were given latitude to develop thier route strategy. I hold the Roswell Hub record for most stops in a shift...
good,Working as a package handler is a good part time job with decent pay.  The job is monotonous however and outside of peak season hours are very low.  The over time and peak pay during peak time is very good.
good,"i enjoyed my time at UPS, i got hired for a seasonal position when they needed the most work done in the least amount of time so there were many opportunities to make more money than your regular scheduled shift."
good,"It's a bit tough cause most men would act like they're doing something instead of helping you. Overall, the company is great company to be a apart of."
good,The packages  has to go out rain or snow. Dress according  to  the weather. Drink plenty  of  water. It's  a fast pace job. The job keeps you fit. You meet new people. You have to caution  with the packages. We never through  packages.
good,a typical shift at UPS is 6 hours and they may call you between 2-3 a week . I learned delivery safety  tips. The hardest part of the  job is the extensive walking.
good,Day to day you would be on call to help out a different driver in your assigned area.  Hard work and tiring but good pay and flexible hours depending on your needs.
good,"Ups is very hard work and it’s very stressful and frustrating at times. The job is a great paying job , great for a work out also even as a job. They give good opportunities and does a lot for you."
good,"it was nice the first few years I help the driver , just thus pass year was a bit dis comforting for me , because of health and food issues at home. cool driving around the city"
good,"Overall, it was fun, but it gets extremely busy and you have to do things that are not even your job. The day before or two days before Christmas we had to stay until 5 am when we had started at 2 pm"
good,"Great Experience Gained while working at UPS. Fast paced, Safety is a must, late nights, great customer satisfaction and flexible. I have no complaints."
good,A typical day at work with ups was always a fun experience working close with the driver delivering packages thew out the city and learning new things about deliver.
good,Everyday was a good day fort me. I just knew to do my job and move quickly. The bosses was very helpful. I just need something with more hours an d something different.
good,"Its a union based shop.  There needs to be more focus on paying the people that work well a good wage, and not the people who dont.  The wage needs to be increased annually on a step incremental basis, and there should be less time needed to gain benefits for part time."
good,I really liked working here because it was a simple job I could do over and over efficiently. It was overnight so the hours finally got to me and had to leave. I truthfully wasn’t getting paid enough for my work.
good,Worked here for a few months just as a summer job. Wasn’t too bad in the beginning until hours started to get cut .. other than that my experience at ups and as a package handler was fine and a good learning experience
good,"fast paced job, good bonus. low hourly wage. Dont know when you are working until the morning of. Changing locations and hours. Nice to talk with customers."
good,"Seasonal package delivery. Cold temperatures, early mornings but steady work for the biggest package handler during the holiday season.  Good work environment, my mentor was accommodating to teaching me my tasks."
good,The work is fast paced so be ready to sweat. Usually you get two 10 to 15 minute breaks. The supervisor was really nice but the manager wasn't. The manager is not very understanding and has little patience.
good,"I worked morning shifts and my supervisor for our branch would direct who was working on exactly what line. Deployment would start anywhere from 7am-8am. If trucks had to be re-organized I would make sure braces were installed to keep packages from shifting. Some packages would weigh up to 70 lbs but there was always a helping hand. The environment for this line of work is heavy-duty, time managing and fast paced. The easy part was laying out after work after a long day."
good,"Quick paced and demanding evironment with real harsh working conditions at times. However, it is simple work with good people and space and opportunity to grow."
good,I really enjoyed working at my store. Management was great and all the employees got along well. The only downside was that a full-time position was not available or possible at our retail store so there was no potential for advancement or better pay.
good,"I applied last year and had 2 interviews. I got my Chauffeur’s License and waited. No reply until I kept calling. I’m still available. Ready, willing and able. What does it take to get confirmed and on the job ?"
good,As a freelance videographer the job had flexibility which served me well to do other jobs along with it. I had to interact with guests and hotel management which was a strong-point for me.
good,"it's a job. great company, bad culture due in part to management/union labor relationship"
good,Ups was a fast paced job most would love if you wanted to be or stay in shape. I learned a lot mentally working the short time i did there and that mostly was patience. When i first started i remember everyday wanting to give up because it was so hard but the management always kept me motivated. That was the only hardest part of the job because i knew lifting and arranging boxes would help me feel like I'm working out with weights.
good,My typical day was greet customers and helping them get on the computer to get package ready to be shipped. The workplace was a good place to work for. I enjoyed working with the people.
good,"I liked working here because I learned a lot about the shipping and packing process that postal services do. During holidays, the store is usually swarmed with folks shipping out packages. Also good to be more on the collaborative side."
good,Ups is a fast paced job really a good second jod because you only get about five hours a day and the checks starting off be like 150 to 200 a week but not enough hours.
good,This was a freight service delivering palletized material to clients in the Triangle Area. It was important to load each item onto the correct truck to avoid delays in the clients merchandize
good,I currently work at UPS and I actually like it. It can get frustrating at times but I have a awesome supervisor that checks in with us and makes sure we are alright !
good,I was just onsite helping out for UPS' peak season. The peak season is Ups busy time of year so they need help with the coordination between drivers and their freight.
good,"Ask questions do your job and don’t be afraid to move up "
good,offers flexible schedule for college students. Offers health benefits. Offers training and promotion opportunities. Offers employee discounts. Offers retirement and pension. Works with some charities. Helps high school students by providing training for mechanics in a Valley High School Magnet program.
good,"It is a hard working job that goes at a fast pace, can learn to multi task provide good benefits there are plenty of ways to make more money and workout and lose weight"
good,Sous - traitant KMD non professionnel. Entreprise UPS agréable et professionnelle.
good,"The drivers I worked with were always very friendly and I had many fun conversations with them. The work is hard, props to the drivers, but it is doable. Not many hours a week, but expect to work 12 or more hours if you work the day."
good,Work hard in light industrial environment. Hard working associates and fork lift practice. Load trailers with hands or with lift. Lots of overtime available.
good,"You could work your butt off,but if you were not a favorite of particular managers .And when it come time for you to get your praise they instead gave praise to there favorite."
good,"It was a seasonal job where you had to be ready to answer a call to work during the work hours of the weekday. If you manage to answer the call and go to work every weekday of the week, you get a bonus on Friday's."
good,"Sunrise shifts had unpredictable end times. "
good,I have worked as a seasonal worker for UPS. The pay is great but some of the management needs retraining. The rushing sometimes affects the safety of the operation.
good,"I liked working there in college because they paid for everything. they pay for all of your classes as long as you get a ""c"" or higher. also they have AWESOME health insurance"
good,it was a fun fast pace winter seasonal position that was not difficult at all and never seemed that boring at all. just prepare to walk and lift quite a bit.
good,This job will keep you on your toes. I suggest you do as much as you can as quick and safe as you can. there is no time to rest here until you get off. they have very high standards and push you to your breaking point but you as well as them have a job to do so don't take anything to heart. it is a very good job to be at and make a living out of. Don't ever take a manager position. watch out for the managers because some of them are shady some will harass you and a few will have your back and actually do their job. the union reps suck so stay on them if you need them to do something.
good,"This job required plenty of running around on your feet and dealing with customers, pleasant or not, and lifting various sizes of parcels. Overall it was a fitting job for me."
good,"Now if I wanna talk about a job that will knock out you, UPS is the job. I never had to go to the gym working there because UPS was the gym lol just in the fashion of loading up boxes. It was competitive & fun but the hours were way too short"
good,You will be stacking packages of varying weights. The work is fasted paced but loader positions are mainly part-time and you are always busy so the time goes by quickly.
good,"helped built my career in a variety of roles and industries, mostly in small companies where I was not just a Business Analyst but also a manual tester and techwriter. I’m not only used to wearing many hats, I sincerely enjoy it;"
good,"I loved my position at ups, the guys I managed, and the company we serviced. The reason I am no longer with them was the new manager and his work ethic."
good,I Worked there for like a month and a half as a assistant truck driver we delivered packages during the peak season was fun had a good time made some decent money.
good,"Loading trucks harder than unloading easy place to work. hard work during the holidays, sometimes you get out early.i worked at the Hub and unloaded and loaded trucks during the holidays and afterwards."
good,"I learned so much at the UPS Stores. They provided me with the bulk of my experience, in using their Point of System software, their customer service, and the interacting with customers."
good,"I've learning to work hard, work under pressure, work fast, and learn how to work with other people. The company is good for benefits and discounts. But the upper management is very unprofessional. They mistreat their employees, they talk to them any kind of way."
good,"On a typical day at work, I would drive to a location specified by the dispatcher at UPS where I would be picked up by my driver.  I would operate the DIAD board which is the device that drivers use to scan packages and make deliveries.  You also obtain signatures on the board from businesses and sometimes residences.  "
good,"one of the most easy going jobs ive ever had was as a package handler, just follow instrustruction and thats all there is to it. I worked at THE UPS STORE"
good,"Everything is really hit or miss. Whether it be your coworkers, employees, bosses, or boss's bosses. Some people were amazing to be in a work environment with but others made the job absolute heck. Especially some members of upper management."
good,great company to work for them have great benefits as well as paid time off even great vacation time with many opportunity to move up i n the company .
good,Processed paperwork as drivers brought it in to reload later for outbound shipments. Immediate supervisor was great but management at the facility where I worked wasn't people friendly.
good,The job itself was not to bad. It was the individuals that I worked with. They got to personal and was hit on every 30 mins. I got to the point I put my headphones in before I go in and don't take them out until after I get in my car.
good,It was a decent job. They worked me a lot almost all day in door 1 everyday because I was the only one strong enough. The pay was a bit too low for the amount of labor that comes with it.
good,"It's production work, plain and simple. If you are willing to work, able to work, you have work. Everybody got treated the same no matter how much time you worked there. You got your raise every year and if you worked hard you could get more time and stood a chance of becoming a driver. It gave me an opportunity to be enterprising while staying in incredible shape. I admit it was fun to beat the snot out of the sort isle because they a lot of opportunity to relax. And they respect somebody that can kick but. Minimum Active Requirements (MAR) for the unload was 1400 pieces an hour. MAR for the sort isle was 1200 pieces an hour. The difference was made up by totes for smalls, bulk handling and walking between bays. The sort isle had to sort packages between 14 belts that were color coded to correspond with zip codes: One above and below the delivery belt, 4 at head level, 4 at waist level and 4 chutes at grating level. Once I got the pattern and habits down I could handle about anybody. "
good,worked there for a long time. have many friends from there. hardest part of job was leaving. the people were great. I loved the job because it was diversified. I was taught in many different areas of business.
good,Being employed for UPS nearly 10 years gave me great hands on work and communication with customers.  When promoted to a team lead it encouraged me to be a role model and train others in different fields to help them advance in the company.
good,"Extremely hot during summer, and somewhat comfortable during the winter. Would start at 4:30am and get done around 9-9:30am. Always on the go in order to get drivers out on time."
good,"Working with a driver means you're always on your feet. You have to be ready to move as soon as you stop, and get the packages on the doorsteps in less than a minute. If you can keep up, you can handle this body of work."
good,"Being with The UPS Store has taught me a variety of jobs within the store. With the skills that I learned through The UPS Store I am able to carry those throughout the rest of my career elsewhere. Great environment, enjoyable, and always provided lots of exciting opportunities of work."
good,The work is there. It's either so hot or so cold. You need WATER. Be prepared to break a sweat and keep it moving. You're either part of the union or you're part of the corporation.
good,"Started off working mornings, but as the holidays got closer the work load became heavier. Often had to work 3rd shift so that drivers could  be on the road by a specific time in the morning."
good,The days were the same. This was a very schedule oriented position. Lots of hard work and it's a warehouse environment. Not much variance in day to day operations.
good,Ups let’s me choose my hours and my boss is very nice. I have worked there for years so i am very good at my job and i get a bonus every christmas. My team is fun.
good,"I enjoyed the people at UPS, but it is what it is. Package handling and hard work, but if you do it, you get in good shape and learn to have responsibility."
good,"UPS por ser una empresa logistica mundial,  tiene un movimiento bastante grande, se maneja estres, pero es muy llevadero gracias al grupo de personas que aportan al proceso de distribucion y de servicio al cliente. Lo mas dificil era el ingreso que era muy temprano ( 5 AM)."
good,Package sorting and loading.  Much turnover.  Hardest part of the job is lifting. Best part of the job is the benefits and pension. There is no advancement opportunities.  Part timers cannot become drivers without losing your seniority.
good,Great work culture and very nice people to work with. A typical day at work requires intricate preparation mentally and physically. Maintaining hydrated is key. Team work and safety is the strong focus of every day for success.
good,"Working with UPS was good and a great workout. Although the work conditions were very rough. Working in 110+ degree weather and lifting packages up to 150 lbs. many of the management were not empathetic at all. I understand we are here to work, but I'm not trying to break my back or have a heat stroke."
good,Great employees and we made or job fun to be at..  Friendly supervisers and 15 minute breaks every 2 hours..  I would love to have this job again. Best job ever.
good,"Working for UPS was all in all a good experience, the only thing to complain about was being understaffed for the work load provided.Other than that for the hours that were given out the break time was reasonable. At the time my supervisor was not all too helpful however I have heard that he no longer works with UPS."
good,"Show up on time and in proper uniform "
good,we start everyday with stretches then we get told what truck were unloading. After that we get in the truck and start putting boxes on the conveyor belt tell we are done or need to go to another truck.
good,"UPS is not a good working environment, they cheat you out of your money that they say you going to get what they say, so if anyone ever work there make sure they give you your worth."
good,Taking in items to be shipped and knowing at the end of the day the things that I packaged would arrive at their destination intact. Also liked the quick paced environment.
good,The job at ups was a fast paced job in order to make sure trucks were loaded and ready to go by a certain time and the faster you worked the faster it is to go home
good,"fast paced warehouse working environment I learned to deal with changing conditions the collaborative employment makes it easier to learn everything about the company good and badthe hardest part is the constant physicality,and the most enjoyable are the works hours"
good,"I come in and look at my que and make sure to input anything that I need to put into the system and that may need to updated. I have learned while working for this company is a tremendous amount from improving my data skills, to working with a large successful corporation. Being a much better communicator and team player. I'd say the hardest thing about my job is just working nights. But I love the flexibility and not being hovered over while I do my job."
good,"Job requires a lot of critical thinking, fast paced desicions and always subject to change. During the holidays your Thanksgiving to Christmas is dedicated to UPS, and at that time it's all hands on deck and may have to perform tasks or certain roles without notice. It is a team effort."
good,Joined UPS facility during winer break for the holiday rush. During my time there the floor supervisor recommended me for a promotion into UPS's management program. Unfortunately due to my college schedule I did not have the time to balance work while completing my college courses.
good,"Not a lot of down time depending on the area you work in. Typically very fast paced with few breaks, sometimes could be over whelming. Lots of opportunities to advance in the company."
good,Fast pace work environment with little time to review your daily productivity. Everything is done with  high expectations and the culture is we can do it for the customer.
good,"I worked at retail The UPS Store and we help the customer with shipping packing, faxing, copying, and scan to email services. The best part of the job was working with the customers."
good,"Typical day deasl with dispatching driver group, "
good,"You start at the bottom seniority and work your way up. It depends on how big the facility is to start driving. if you like customer service, its the job for you. bad management."
good,It's good to start your carrier. Work place is good but cant say very good because i have seen other companies workplace and their culture. Hardest part of this job is to work on most oldest eighties and nighties applications in 21st century. Management have open door policy. It's really good.
good,"I work 4am-9 am. The hours suck but the pay is alright. I was hired on with an attendance bonus. if I show up on time, I get an extra twenty dollars a day. Easy to advance at UPS. Benefits and better pay come with time"
good,Big Brother is watching you.  There is no room for error!  The good news is that you will never ever forget the great driving habits you will learn here.  Right turns only!
good,It’s a good company to work for but it doesn’t allow for you to have a family life. Your expected to come to work no matter what the weather conditions are outside
good,As a single parent my UPS job allowed me to provide a very comfortable life for my children. You have to be willing to give up a lot of yourself and expect to work long hard hours in all kind of weather conditions. If you are willing to give then UPS will treat you fairly and you can build a very comfortable life through your employment.
good,It's very hard grunt work. Some managers care about you but some don't really care about you. They are very rude and don't care if you are a part-timer because if you are good they will make you stay and you can't say no.
good,"The most physically demanding job I’ve done, comparable to construction work. Because of the fast pace, strenuous nature of this job, can cause stress. Many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Was steady paced and consistent"
good,They don't pay people what they deserve and the only way you can move up is if management likes you.  The job is simple and office is laid back. It's not a bad place to work.
good,The work is hard but the people I worked with made it worth while and the benefits as well. The labor becomes extreme in the beginning but slowly becomes routine like anything else. You learn to work passed the extremely hot days and the frigid cold nights. But again having great co-workers makes the difference.
good,"Secure job that provides great benefits, room to advance by moving up through the company ranks.  Offers competitive salaries, but little work life balance"
good,"Great company!!!!!!!!!!!Need to have great work ethic and willing to work hard everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good place to work if you don’t have a degree, make good money after a while."
good,"Nice, independently owned store on ASU Campus.  I was offered many freedoms, allowing me to work and run the store in my own vision.  We handle packages and mail for approx 10,000 students and staff on 2 of ASU's campuses."
good,UPS is a fast Paced work enviorment thats has you load tons and tons of boxes. If you like fast paced work this is for you. Mostly everyone at UPS wants to become a driver.
good,It was a fast paced work area with little pay and little hours in my area there was a lack of staff and help hardly any of the workers came to work and barely showed up half of the time
good,"A typical work day consisted of the same following of orders, usually carrying out the job you were hired for but occasionally having to help out other departments. Management stresses the importance of efficiency and maintaining a fast pace. The hardest part of the job is staying efficient over an extended period of time but being able to compete for best sorter is what I found to be most fun."
good,"Load package cars with little to no help. Very hard work. The management did not care, you were just a number. Did not offer much advancement. I should not have stayed there as long as I did."
good,"The division of the company I worked for is now defunct, and employees were farmed out to other divisions, if they got to keep their job at all.  It's an unreliable place to work."
good,A typical day is fast paced with limited breaks. I learned organizational skills as well as time management.The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,From a small department to globalisation. Was part of the team that help train newbies and set up globalisation. Became leader of the picking team after 6 mths.
good,as a temporary driver helper you just assist the UPS driver with delivering packages for a given amount of time. It was fun and its good extra income for the Holiday Season
good,"United Parcel Service was a fast paced job.  The benefits were great, along with the pay.  The only drawback was the lack of family time during the week."
good,Decent work place to start out if you do not have a plan. The work load is decent. You grow relationships with your co workers and part time supervisor.
good,"There are various things that you can do at a UPS Store, so it is best if you are a versatile person. Customers who enter the store most likely do not know what they want. So they are searching for you to shed some light and help them out. Due to the versatility of working here, there is a lot of knowledge you need to have down. Such as faxing, basics of printing, knowledge of both UPS and USPS Shipping policies and basic data entry. The work place can either be very productive, friendly and exciting; however, it can also be extremely stressful, negative and boring. A downside is that there are not very many places for advancement in the company. However, depending on the boss, can make this up by being very flexible with the schedule and having a close knit bunch of coworkers can be really nice as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the UPS Store and am very grateful for the relationships I have gained personally and business connections I have made as well."
good,"Challenging work "
good,"Working here kept me constantly busy, and challenged me every day. The team was great; helpful with staff, helpful with training, etc. The managers are strict, but accommodation, and it is 100% a company that I would recommend if you want a change of pace from retail work."
good,"good people, friendly environment and modern office space with a focus on collaboration. Provides the necessary tools to complete assignments and provides training as needed."
good,"Typical day : superhero"
good,Overall I enjoy working here at the UPS Store. I have great coworkers its a nice steady pace with a few rushes a day. The only thing I would have to complain about it the management. My boss owns two stores and he seems a little in over his head because he can not balance them. I like working here the atmosphere is great but because of the lack of balance my pay checks have been messed up too many times resulting in me missing money.
good,"My day started off with setting up my area, starting all the computers, programs and checking the equipment before employees arrive. Then a meeting was held for all the supervisors in my area. After I went to my area I managed and checked on employees and who was present. I assigned job duties to employees based on my observation of their training. During the day I walked around watching and reporting on all the employees and their progress. I finished my reports and safety reports of equipment."
good,"I lucked out and worked under a competent and fun manager. "
good,Fast paced job definitely have to be focus and get enough rest as time passed I️ got great at it and enjoyed the work.I️ gave myself goals every night to try to get more and more packages handled
good,A great physical labor job for those who want to work in a fast pace environment. Can be stressful at times but its manageable. Overall its more of a side job for extra money.
good,"Advanced after a few months of working here. Great lead supervisor, down to earth.  Fun work environment and a place where I would want to retire from."
good,"Used proprietary applications, huge expanse around the world, not much room to grow.  They allow employees to purchase stock at a discount which was great"
good,I would recommend UPS to everyone that would like a start to get your life going. It's a great job environment and it provides a lot of opportunities for the future.
good,"In a nut shell USPS is a good job to have if you don't have anything else going on in your life.  The hours are long and sometimes takes a toll on your body. I loved because you were paid to workout is how I looked at it.  I just didn't agree with some of the management, and how things were dealt with during my time there."
good,Fast paced work environment. Staying very busy and on your feet. Good opportunity to advance with relocation. Tough draining job as most positions are at night.
good,UPS is a good place to start if your looking for a career. you can move up in the company fairly quickly the pay is pretty decent and its just an overall good experience.
good,clocking in before the sunrise 
good,Great job for some but not for all advancement is lengthy process if you have 5 10 years to sacrifice for a future that's good but like anything else in life there are no gaurantees in it
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, this is a company that you are able to grow and move up rather quickly. They also many opportunities for furthering your education."
good,"It's great to fix customer's print jobs when they bring in a file that doesn't turn out like they imagine.  When people hire a ""graphic designer"" to make a wedding invitation that doesn't turn out right because the designer isn't aware of pre-press specifications it makes it highly rewarding to see the look on their face when you can fix their problem and win the print contract."
good,The day in and day out activities of a UPS driver can take a toll on your body as well as your mental because at the end of the shift you will be tired and if you can build up a tolerance for this and don't mind all types of weather its steady and well paying
good,"I have good co-workers , we work as a team for everything if I need help finding something , packing something they are there to help me. It’s A great place to work it’s actually inside of The Omni Hotel In Dallas ."
good,it is a regular job you have to be quick with things to get stuff done and you got to make sure you are always on time and to barley miss days of work
good,A typical day at UPS was up and down. Some days you work some days you do not. The hardest part of the day was in the morning knowing if I work that day or not.
good,"You think all warehouse jobs are the same, right? Miles of shelving, forklifts going beep-beep, piles of bubble wrap. But the experience of working in a warehouse varies quite a bit, depending on if you're working for a small company or an international corporation. I've done both."
good,"I was a seasonal package car delivery driver from October 2017 to mid-January 2018.   Training was very good - spent a week in Denver at their drivers training school.  I had my own route once I completed the training and volunteered to work every Saturday that a route was available for pick-ups on Saturdays.  Overall, it was a good experience and I would do it again."
good,It was an ok job but i feel as if they have their favorites that they pick to hire permanent. But overall its ok fast paced you work alone on a assembly line.
good,"Great position for entry level position.  Fast paced environment that requires large amounts of knowledge base. "
good,Uos ia very unique experience. Very cut throat and quick paced.  Hours are very important and you are rated by that . Hard work and a lot of responsibility and it takes a very long time to move up
good,"Great temp position, with great workers, unfortunately I worked my self out of a position by finishing assignment ahead of schedule. Was offered a position but was at a lower rate so I could not accept."
good,Working their was a life learning experience. A typical day there is usually fast paste and busy. You must be able to multitask at all times. The experience was very great and can only help you to further your education and interest.
good,"ubicar estados de cuenta seleccionar por vencimiento proceso de cobranzas, visitas a los mas morosos."
good,"Fun to work for, and has flexible hours. Good if needing something more stable and has several different outputs of job views. Helps you learn how the world of international trade works"
good,"The UPS Store is a great place to work when you are beginning your journey into the shipping/receiving career field.  The experience gained helps to open doors into UPS Corporate, FEDEX, and USPS.  It is a franchise so the benefits are limited, but the teamwork that is established provides learning and camaraderie for everyone.  A normal day consists of everyone bringing anything from small packages to huge furniture to be shipped all over the world.  It's a great way for graphic designers to gain experience and those with a temptation to organize things to help others pack and ship items and gifts for families.  Great place to work and gain experience for the career move into higher positions."
good,A typical day at work for me is to come in early and get to my area and be prepared to work. At times some employees are not on time for the shift in turn shifting more work on other employees
good,"You hustle for little pay. All of us were for the most part because the healthcare is incredible, but if you stick it out for 3-4 years they are always promoting from within"
good,"Knowledgeable on international air freight, good team work, good choice of hours, local / close to home opportunities, easy to get to, good union, good management"
good,Armado de equipos de iluminacion de emergencias y Ups.
good,Entry level job stacking boxes. Worked here night shift while attending school and participating in the Metropolitan College program which paid for my tuition. Learned time management skills. Had decent amount of downtime which allowed me to study and complete homework. Cooperative coworkers and management that was easy to get along with.
good,"It can be a very good job. Each UPS Store is a Franchise, so each store very so much. I've met some owners who were awesome and there business was doing great. Unfortunately most owners are older med who are stuck in there way."
good,"UPS is a tough job. The pay and benefits are excellent if you put in your time (union). The management positions are paid well. The work is hard, dirty, and very demanding."
good,Job was easy but stressful the higher the volume. Coworkers were alright. You do your job and do it right you will breeze through. Late hours are rough but worth it if you're going through Metropolitan College program.
good,Working here is a lot of fun you meet a lot of wonderful people and get the ship items all around the world. Guaranteed at least one day off every week. Friendly work place.
good,"If you make the right choice and stay in the Union, UPS can be a great career. Learn the contract, talk to your shop steward, go to the  local union meetings, and you'll be able to defend yourself and your coworkers from anything the Company might throw at you (or take from you) and you'll be able to secure a stable living for you and your family."
good,"Opportunity to move from part time to full time, as a full time driver can make $60,000 to $100,000 with over time. Very good benefits and vacation time. It is a union shop."
good,"very hard place to work management pay was low  days"
good,"Overall it's a nice part time job, everyone there is friendly, the hardest part is having to do a whole truck by yourself going from 1 end to the other to break jams"
good,"A typical day at work is laid back but you always have something to do. I would recommend to someone working at a UPS store but make sure to do your research on the management first. Unfortunately, the head owners and management thrived off of drama at my last work place. But with the right people, its a great work environment."
good,"They need to get with the days, some of the rules are still from the 40's. I should be able to have a beard if I would like. I should be able to choose any type of part time job I want."
good,"UPS is a very large, international company with over 250,000 employees nationwide, with 15,000 in Louisville. Over nearly 31 years I have had the pleasure of working with and for some truly wonderful and talented people. Overall the my experience at UPS has been a positive one."
good,"4 to 5 hours of hard work in the morning. "
good,Harsh working environment. More assistance needed when asked to perform task that go over physical requirement. Managers better understanding of the physicality of employees below them.
good,"temporary employment lot of hard work and has to be at work very early in the morning which is something i enjoy very much, good co-workers that work very hard"
good,Running from truck to truck making sure that everything is locked and secure getting them ready to go over the road to different places if the United States for delivery.
good,"A typical day consisted of processing 15,000 packages every night. Some days I loaded, some days sorted, and other days I unloaded. Management was poor; everyone was there for a check. Some supervisors said very nasty things to employees. I learned how to work in a rapid-paced environment. The hardest part of the job was staying healthy, trying to keep my back from hurting every night. There was no real easy part of the job due to its physical demand."
good,"I was a unloaded and they expect u to do so many packages per hour. It was only 15-20 hours tops with very good advancement opportunities but it was a 12 year waiting list, which I could not afford to wait. It was also a union job so sometimes my check would be 60 dollars after fees. I just could not live off tht"
good,This would be a great place for someone who only wants to work 3 hours a night. It's fast paced and I personally don't think you're paid enough for what you do. This would be a great job for someone who needs or wants some extra cash or college students.
good,"This job was a temporary job during the holiday season. And unfortunately there were no open positions after the holiday season, but I had a good experience working with UPS."
good,I gain a lot of work experience in dealing with customers and handling difficult situations. although the position was temporary ie seasonal i have learn the nature of the job.
good,"Can get a lot of hours consistently. Fast paced. Very simply, you drive the package car and deliver the parcels. Cannot hit anything. Monotonous but can be a good career."
good,It was a good part time/seasonal job for what it was. They provided plenty of time to make decent money. Gave you over time after 5 hours. Only thing was they only gave you one 10 minute break for a physically demanding job and don't guarantee full time employment after.
good,"This is for the UPS Store.  Each store is individually owned and operated. I really enjoy working here.  It is easily confused with UPS, however.  My bosses are great."
good,UPS is great place to work and they offer a great deal of amazing benefits. There is a core of management staff that make up the main decision making unit and they can make the job however the union takes care of the employees.
good,"working at UPS was not  hassle , it's very fast-paced . the company itself is great . people get their package on time , it gets better having your co workers help you with anything."
good,I only worked at UPS as a seasonal employee.  I helped deliver packages to homes and places of business with the same driver during the holiday rush.  It was a good experience.
good,Unfortunately working for a franchise limits your opportunity for growth. Your growth and opportunity depends on the franchise owner. Some owners truly care about structures and helping you grow but some of them just care about profit.
good,Very good job especially for a first time job . Easy a lot of labor must be able to pick up atleast 50 pounds or more. Must be very motivated wanting to work
good,"Thevjob was cool and I liked to preload , but hours kind of suck at low pay, well atleast at the location I'm at. Only work about 19-20 hours weekly..."
good,"Working at UPS was great, but very hard. It has great compensation, and treats its employees very well. The hours were very long, and the amount of packages were very large but manageable. I would recommend the Ups to anyone."
good,"Fast paced culture, very demanding hours. Some of management is lazy, others work as hard as their employees. A typical work day is 9 plus hours, depending on your truck load, how fast your deliveries go and when you can finish your pick ups."
good,"Très bonnne équipe ambiance agréable"
good,Cool easy laid back job for a youngster who wants to advance. They have programs that help pay for school if you’re into that. Job security is also good
good,"Customer direct shipment resolutions and strategies. Customer Center and logistic integration                                                                           through IT, planning and coordination. Extensive training in UPS systems."
good,Fast paced work place on your feet at all times don’t make friends always just stay to yourself the hardest part is making sure you work and don’t stop untill you feel the need too
good,Not a bad job for seasonal.  You have next to no chance getting hired on full time.  Good luck. Hours are pretty fair lots of walking and lifting. So good luck with that.
good,I think UPS is a good company to work for. When I worked there I enjoyed it but it was a fast paced company. And you don’t stop to take a lunch if your in the truck delivering packages.
good,"Contact all your team make sure they are working, if not document reason on report, Learned how to deal with attitudes.hardest part was leaving, Best part was being rewarded for doing a great job."
good,I unloaded trucks and if you do not meet their standards they will find someone that will. Also the only real movement you could make without a degree would be to drive mail trucks.
good,Was a good job for outdoorsy type people. Learned a bit more on how to handle situations that require cooperation. Have to be fast and wiling to learn to lessen burden on driver during prime time.
good,"Great place to be employed by. Friendly people, patient employees, and generous managers. I initially thought it would be the opposite since there are so many people and they cannot cater to everyone’s needs, but they somehow find a way to make everyone feel welcome and at home."
good,"UPS has rewards and benefits, however, the culture is developed for productivity and not for personal well-being.  It is very possible to work and grow, but personal morals can be compromised"
good,the job was fairly easy and a fun job to do. my only issue were the hours i was allowed to work for the certain route they assigned me to. the hardest part of the job was finding the packages for delivery.
good,"if you like face paced work and alot of lifting this is a job for you, unload all the trucks then load the big tractor trailor truck, very stressful and fast paced, going out with the driver was nice to deliever packages"
good,Hard working and always pressed to empty trailers as quickly as possible. You will be moved from one department to another as the building may need more workers in some areas more than others.
good,"Nice job could be better. I met great people on the job who really looked out for me, honestly the hardest part of the job was trying to deliver a package when the person wasn’t present"
good,"enjoyed my time working for them, along as your willing to be active and have conversations with the people your delivering to then this job would be for you"
good,"The job is self explanatory, fast paced, safety always first. Drivers tell you what to do and what not to do. It is Over all good job you can move up in."
good,"I was hired during an event around peak season. I was quite excited to work there because of the opportunity to climb the ladder and become a manager; however, so many people were hired at the same time, that because of my lack of seniority I often got cut. Sometimes only working about 6 hours a week. the travel from my place to their parking lot at 3 am was not worth being cut 1 hour in and driving back home. I would recommend working there, just personally it didn't work for me."
good,"Job was wonderful "
good,"You can get a lot of hours during peak season (Thanksgiving to Christmas), but after that they may decide not to keep you. Great for a second job if you don't mind the weird hours."
good,A typical day is very stressful. Having to deal with management  and the elements was a hard combination. Their standards a brutal for an aging employee base.
good,Work is fast paced and pretty straight forward. Things are meant to be done a specific way in order to maintain pace and safety for all workers. Safety is most important.
good,"certified me for forklift on my orientation. got to meet a lot of good people, help was provided if couldn't finish or if needed help. weather was only downside extremely cold in winter and oven hot in the summer"
good,"it is a fast paced job that you must be able to learn quickly. you must be alert and safe at all times, and be aware of your surroundings and the packages you hold"
good,this job is very physical it requires lifting walking etc. everyone is friendly and nice for the most part it is a seasonal position i will apply to work part time after this.
good,All in all it was not a bad place to work. Many of the current drivers complain all the time and often the work environment is negative but they don't have much to say when pay day arrives.
good,"The job definitely pays the bills, however the only downfall to it is that starting out you are the lowest on the foo chain and it is very noticeable. Also hours significantly drop after the peek season. It has been a full week and haven’t had work since the peek has dropped."
good,great benefits  great safety culture hard working honest people only a few lazy people manage to stay management will ask for everything but if you ask for something they will act like they don't know  worst management I have ever encountered stingy cutthroat workplace
good,"Too much work, not enough pay. Goof benefits, but it required a full year to get them. I personally had issues with some of upper management, pertaining to them not caring for their employees very much."
good,Not the best company to work for but it is a huge stepping stone. I love the area that it is in. It made it easy for me to commute. Main thing I didnt like was how poorly managed it was.
good,picking and packing using a bread cart to select orders available advancement for equipment operators and those with previous knowledge of shipping and receiving procedures
good,"UPS in the north or Midwest are a much more fair environment. In the south, you will be held back by race, and your academic achievements vs your manager's lack there of. I hope the company survives the amazon onslaught but it may be to tied to the old ways to pivot appropriately"
good,"Excellent co-workers, with a huge range of diversity and always willing to help each other out. Management is overall pretty good with one or two exceptions. Keep track of your own hours and check the pay stub every week."
good,"This is tough work not requiring much brain power, that is if you're a loader/unloaded. I would advise you to be aware that if you are applying to a driver helper position that it is typically a ""bait and switch"" operation. The Driver Helper position sounds fun and is just used to get you to apply so they can get you to load trucks. The Helper positions are applied for by established employees."
good,Everything is very fast paced and constantly moving. Everybody is usually pretty willing to help one another whenever they can. The higher ups are very concerned about the safety of their workers.
good,"Working at UPS was always fast paced but I made a lot of friends and it kept my in great shape. I worked mostly in the unload. This job was temporary, but I would recommend ups to friends and family. My brother actually currently works here part time while he is on school. managers were always flexible with school schedules."
good,A hardworking person will be given the resources they need to succeed. There are many opportunities to advance within departments and moving to other departments is encouraged.
good,"Working at UPS is a very strenuous job. If you enjoy moving around a lot, walking, lifting, basically exercising, then you would be a perfect fit for the job. It is a hard job but very routine so it gets easy."
good,Ups is great please to work if your are looking for a part time job right after high school. They will help pay for some of your college. The work envirement is a quick pace but with your fellow employees time does go fast.
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment and working with new people. I liked to stay busy and UPS kept my plate full. I enjoyed working outdoors and with clients.
good,Nice hard work for someone who is very energetic and hard working convient working hours nice location 5 hour shifts 3 hour shifts and decent lunch breaks
good,"Terrible pay, very slow process trying to advance. You will have to find another part time job just to survive, be prepared to bring home less than $150 bucks a week."
good,Typical day at work was going out on the truck delivering to homes and businesses. First place I Learned door to door service. Hardest part of the job was the long hours.
good,The days at work are always different. Starting with stretching. I start in trailer 15 usually and 10 on Sundays i do a Texas load. The hardest part of the job is moving packages around and doing carts. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting Popsicles when its hot outside.
good,It's was a place of fast pace environment. It was a short 4 hour shift that seem to go by quickly. It was a great experience to work for a delivering company .
good,Ups was an great opportunity and experince to see the in and outs of the world of packaging around the world. the work got a lttle stressful and overwhelming sometimes.
good,"Meet up with the driver at agreed upon site."
good,"I worked at UPS as a Thanksgiving/Christmas temp hire, then got called to stay on after the RUSH season ended, the job was fast paced, a lot of packages to be unloaded label side up then sorted by zip code and organized on the truck for delivery"
good,very early hours and fast paced labor await you in the pre-loading crew. but the job does have a strong union with great benefits. there are normally other shifts later in the day but at a pay cut.
good,Great company - very family oriented. A typical day included helping customers and packaging their belongings. I learned a lot about the shipping and printing industries.
good,I work a couple of different positions.  Management was not the best position to be in.  When working the belt and fixing packages it was a great job to have.
good,The job in it of itself is not bad but the culture is definitely not the best to be in. Negligence and Dishonesty is common; and on top of that it is almost impossible to grow past the first rung of the ladder because of seniority.
good,It was a decent place to work they work you hard but I didn't mind that they keep you busy. Your never sitting around there is always something to do.
good,The job is good in terms of benefits and time off. Pay raises are small and annually. I have not had bad management at my time there. Hardest part of the job was the fact that you never really know what you are going to come into everyday at the job. Anything can happen there to make you work longer hours. Overall not a bad job
good,"Fast production,time sentative,checking to make sure all driver are at job,completing all trucks,trailers are ready for early am delivery.Completing all employees daily data."
good,Ups was my first job when I start working there I didn't understand their work. The work was so hard for me that I wanted to leave but I stayed in work
good,"Various shifts to choose from, hours vary...laid back environment, casual atmosphere, and great benefits. Holidays are basically mandotory,excluding mailing holidays."
good,"Is a good job but if you dont know how drive you gonna find it hard, becouse is in a place complicated to go on bus. They have a lot of beneficts and good equipment"
good,"Simply put, if given the opportunity to rejoin the company, I would not do so. This is a very financially secure company that has high expectations of their management team and hourly employees."
good,"Elemanin hiç kıymeti olmayan, az paraya çalıştıran, şeflerin baskısı ile çalışılan, işçiyi yıldırmaya yönelik çalışılan bir şirket."
good,It was a challenging job but there is definitely room for advancement and a place where people work their entire lives. I needed a change in my life and that is why I left but they had great benefits and competitive pay.
good,I was a seasonal delivery driver. Got all my training done in a week and a couple more late I had my route. It was hard work but I liked it because I got paid a fair wage.
good,"Start off your day really early and it's not stressful when you arrive. It becomes stressful when you see how many packages are in your trucks. The job itself is a workout, you get your cardio in everyday."
good,"Very simple, meet with the driver at a agreed location and would ride with him for however long it took to deliver all of our packages for that area. Would sometimes get dropped off in a neighborhood with multiple packages while he delivered nearby."
good,"Being a package handler limited the hours that I could work.  I needed full time employment so after 5 years, I left due to no full time positions available.  Benefits were good and there were regular increases in pay."
good,A typical work evening consisted of reporting to your location in preparation for sort to begin. The most enjoyable parts is my awesome coworkers who were all in great spirit.
good,this job was a part time position at the moment ups is a great company but i got hurt a couple times an they fired me.the last time i was hurt they was upset because i was out for a week but i had a doctors note
good,"The UPS Store is a franchise so each store is different. Management is usually good. Downside, no health benefits. It's an easy-ish job and at certain stores there is opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great job, exciting atmosphere. My one wish is that I wish it could be a full time, permanent position. Good company to work for, excellent benefit structure."
good,This job can be very demanding in the sense of proving and showing production to climb the ladder for better jobs and better pay. You'll work hard and earn every cent you're paid.
good,Load and Haul a Van OTR. Management needs some training they always have stuff messed up. The sit and wait time for loads because no one has their stuff together ends up messing with your drive time. Other that that a good paying company.
good,"ho lavorato con piacere all interno di questa azienda se pur non continuativamente ,gestendomi in discreta autonomia nelle consegne che dovevo effettuare e trovandomi molto bene con colleghi e proprietà"
good,Working for an independently owned and operated UPS Store is much different that actual UPS. The only thing we didnt do was drive or load/unload the trucks. I enjoyed my job and my working with my coworkers. I had made connections that will be life long.
good,"A typical day consists of constant working, moving packages at different rates. the weight unevenly switches as you handle the packages. You deal with packages that are worn and needs repair. Breaks are giving randomly during the sort which cause many people to get stressed out. You only work on average 4 to 5 hours a day but the work makes it feel twice as long."
good,"The management was poor went to another job working through a temporary so i relocated ......................................................it,was ok"
good,I would recommend a job to someone but I would tell them it involves a lot of heavy lifting and running around the job is based on scan per hour  you have to have 200 or more scans per hour . To keep you out of trouble if your slow in scanning it's not the job for you.  And the pay sucks for all that you do. And it's only a 3.5 hour shift. Per night Monday- Friday. 3rd shift 11:25pm-2:55am. And a great union.
good,"Mon travail était de décharger des gros colis dans des camions."
good,This review is for the stores only - locally owned franchises so can be demanding and training is inconsistent but overall positive environment. Very dependent on owners.
good,Ups is a Very fast paced environment where you load trucks with packages. If you are not paying attention you can have packages that is do not belong on the truck. It is important to stay alert and work fast while follow rules and regulations to remain safe.
good,"On a typical workday I would meet up with my driver near our route. We would spend roughly 4 or 5 hours delivering packages together. Then at the end of the day I'd be dropped back at my car and we'd fill out my paperwork for the day. I'd usually end up spending the day having great conversations with the driver, which is easily the best part of the job. As long as you and your driver get along the job will be fun and the day will pass quickly."
good,"very fast pace with lack of breaks, loading and unloading trucks with packages. very tiring and wasn't a stable job. had lack of benefit and very small window to improve and grow with company."
good,"Even tho great place to work, erratic hours, difficult to make after work plans. Too much management intervention in daily operations. However, overly fantastic benefits. Older drivers may experience difficulty keeping up with daily work."
good,"Able to follow directions in order to ensure safety to people around the worksite"
good,"Lots of fast paced positions in the warehouse in ONT , CA. Managers were good, didn't rush, job itself was fast paced, but no overtime rush feel. Some other groups would need help at end of shifts, and we could choose to help them for overtime pay. "
good,"Faced paced environment. Stressful job. Unreliable workers. Dirty, old facility pushed beyond its intended production means on a daily basis. Every day slightly different than the next. Start times and end times vary. Somewhat hostile environment at times. Yelling, cursing, and degrading people is common place."
good,Good job for part-time work. Takes too long to try and get eligible for a full-time position. Whether hourly or a salary management position. It takes years to reach a full-time position
good,it was a great place to work. like getting paid to work out. it gets extremely hot in the warehouse so that's about the biggest downside fi could find while I was there
good,"I enjoyed working for them. Meeting new people everyday and helping them with their packages, copying, or their pickup orders. Making sure that there items are packed right and sent to the right address"
good,I worked overnight so we didn't start until like 2 am but it was a pretty fun job great people we have about 22 trucks that was needed to be unloaded but on different days they trucks could be more
good,"Much physical work to do with all employees working with a drive to finish their tasks as quickly and as safely as possible. Great company to work for with lots of benefits, especially for degree-seeking students."
good,I was a driver helper at ups for a month or so. The management at my location was very behind and didn't end up hiring me until I only had weeks to work. I rode with a driver and delivered the packages. It was difficult and tiring.
good,"Good team effort coming from each individual, Overall an enjoyable job. Manual labor, in an efficient way, benefits each and every person there. Teaches you that work is a natural and beneficial part of having team members, but also handy to have when alone."
good,I loved the fast paced environment and constant box lifting. Only wished you could work more hours and get a little better pay for being a package handler.
good,"If you are energetic, like fast pace work, are in good physical condition, and are willing to put in the time this would be a great career for you....."
good,Hard working willing to learn more very ambitious very productive  I enjoy making the day go bye if a coworkers having a bad day I hope I can lift that person up to do a better job
good,"If you want money and a dependable position. (As Long as you show you are worth their while) UPS is a great place to work. The money and benefits are very, very good. But at the end of the day you walk out tired, dirty and realizing their will be another billion box for you to move tomorrow. And people screaming at you to get the work done!"
good,I loved the environment unloading loading the trucks. The co workers were also kind also the boss was nice also. Looking at all the merchandise was also ok
good,Atención y servicio al cliente. Trabajo simple de correo.
good,When you go to work a CACH you are guaranteed to work your butt off at first but able to move you in rank quickly. its a very fast paced job so if you like to move slow this job isnt for you
good,Micro-management has taken over. Human error cannot be tolerated. Very demanding job. High value and time sensitive packages along with time restrictions make for a stressful day when driving a large truck.
good,As a part of the management team at UPS I learned how to cooperate and coordinate the tasks at hand with the employees. Training new employees was my favorite part of the job.
good,poor management always looking to fire you they watch every move you make on the street is no recongtion easy job you deliver load and unload truck collect money
good,"UPS demands everyone in operations to do their best, do their most, and they will pay them well. It is demanding and stressful, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,Typical day on the local sort consists of unloading all of the package cars as they return from their delivery routes throughout the day. Once unloaded the packages are sorted into different trailers to be delivered to their final destination.
good,"There are alot of opportunities to advance at UPS. The work is fast pace and physically demanding, but pays well and has fantastic benefits for being part time."
good,UPS was a good I liked it. I was working there seasonal. The only part I didnt like was when I have to go up a couple flight of floors with a heavy package. Other from that everything was great. Its perfect for a first job
good,Haven't work there in years. but was a good place to work. weekends  off never work past 10pm. Nothing bad to say about this place Bedford Park was where I worked
good,Good company to work for with fair pay and benefits. Management is good to employees and works together to solve problems.  Most enjoyable part is the fact that you work alone on the road and manage your own time to get your work done.
good,I worked as a driver helper during the holidays. The pay was great and hours lasted as long as you had packages in the back to deliver. Had they needed non-seasonal I would have continued to work there.
good,"its a good job but its disorganized , like everything was good but the problem was disorganization , like some people sometimes werent in the system ."
good,"A quality alternative to the food or service industries as a teenager looking for a low experience, near minimum wage job. Provided opportunities to work with small businesses and help the community."
good,"This is a great place for you to go to school and have a job that will work with your schedule.  During the peak season, there is work galore so be ready to work a straight shift."
good,"My job was seasonal at UPS.  As a driver helper I only worked during the Christmas season. The hours were long, the work was hard, and the pay didn't quite seem to be enough. But they taught me how to stay safe, and they paid overtime when applicable."
good,Great company to work for! When you become a UPSER you become apart of a second family. Everyone will support your growth and goals. Working for UPS will provide you will endless opportunity but advancement will not happen quickly.
good,"not a typical 9 to 5 job, a lot of walking and heavy lifting, however no matter hard you work it will never be enough for management and temporary drivers are set up to fail if not liked for whatever reason by management and regardless of feedback from supervisors. the culture between drivers is civil, the hardest part or the job believe or not is getting through the first 3 hours of your day after that its rather repetitive, satisfied customers make it all worth it"
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, had great opportunities and excellent benefits. Friends that continued to work there are living well and reaping the great benefits of this company."
good,"unload as many trucks as possible, after that head up to small sorts to see if they needed help. after that sweep and make sure area is clean and clear"
good,"was only at UPS for the seasonal shift when business picks up around christmas time, was a good company when i was there definitely opportunity to advance in the company"
good,Enjoyed working there for the time being. Was a fast paced work environment. Was busy at times but never was overwhelming. Had good supervisors and co workers
good,It was not an easy job. I knew nothing about the workings of this job and I did not have any employees when I started and only had one for a short period of time who did not know anything about the job as well. I was basically put into a position where there was very little chance of success.
good,Got paid to work out.  Greatest job I ever had.  Required minimal thinking and lots of physical exercise.  Most of the people were decent.  Pay is too low.
good,"The culture can be very negative in the warehouse, high stress for small amount of time, often leading to negative reactions to seemingly mild situations. Although management does its best to combat and keep well organized the warehouse, it is hard to manage so many personalities in one area."
good,"Nice Experience, Very helpful in my gaining experience in areas such as Dispatch, Work Assignments, Logistics and warehouse management. The overall daily activities was one in which all employees were trained and developed with the proper tools to make them successful in their designated work assignments"
good,"Very early days, there would always be a lot do for just one person for all four trucks in such a short period of time. I wouldn't recommend the job for a person who is just starting their first job. IT is very stressful."
good,"Physical job, but sometimes had lots of downtime due to plane delays. Overall good experience with opportunities to move to permanent position if interested."
good,Management was great. The job was very fast paced and almost no room for errors. I learned about a lot of states and their zip codes. We had to make sure all packages were scanned so people would know exactly where their packages were and where it was headed to. I liked that they had free medical for your whole family. I had a son that was being raised by his father but I could still get medical for him.
good,"hard hours to work with, friendly environment, filled with hard workers. Lots of teamwork involved and really fast paced! Long shifts during christmas time!"
good,The job requires a lot of lifting and physical activity. But the managers/supervisors aren't on your back the whole night and the pay is ok. I work the overnight shift.
good,"Job that is not for lazy people. You have to be able to move fast and think quick if any problems suddenly arise. Supervisors could be a lil more responsive and have a little better judgment in terms of running operations, but overall great experience for work You have to be disciplined, dedicated, and have drive to excel in this job. With these three key components the sky is the limit."
good,"Communicate plays a major role towards accomplishing the task at work. We use communication to properly load all packages on the vehicles for delivery. Physically, we lift packages and use high tech equipment; so we work together as a team to maintain a strictly safe facility to avoid minor injuries. The most enjoyable part of the job so far, is being acknowledged to become a supervisor of the amazing team I work with."
good,"Coming from desk jobs, I was shocked at how militant UPS management can be.  They aren't caring, professional, and helpful like I was used to.  It's more of the ""break you down and build you back up again"" mentality.  It really wasn't for me.  But the benefits are amazing if you can stick with it."
good,"This job is rather fast paced.  You are required to do a lot of heavy lifting and keep up with a pace that I feel is asking too much, by yourself. I understand that this is a package facility and people's packages have to get out, but to throw someone into a 300 package per minute trailer with no help and expect them to keep things clean is unrealistic."
good,"Reported time sheets, paid bills, collected money from customer, sorted mail, packaged goods, customer service,tallied end of day reports and hired and fired employees"
good,"Fast,steady,non-stop work flow very busy at all times but a fun place to be. Stressful at times but most of everyone got along and helped one another."
good,"This is a job if you have a lot going on, or school, or another job in your life. This job is perfect for if you have another source of income. Ups is a Part time job"
good,cool place to work only if you don't mind being on your feet all night and constantly be on the move and be able to work at a fast pace with minimum break time
good,"responsible for 4 UPS buildings and support of 75 outside vendors,"
good,"I liked it for what it was any problems were outweighed by the incredible healthcare and insurance that come with benefits. But the pay is not something that will put bread on the table. Working there in your spare days is the best way to go unless you're seeking to be a supervisor, manger, or driver."
good,Very well run company with lots of room to grow. I would have stayed longer if it weren't for school . I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a good company and is willing to work hard.
good,I was fortunate enough to work in the office where it was climate controlled and my job was very relaxed so I have zero complaints. I actually enjoyed my time there.
good,United Parcel Services is a great business that includes many benefits for event only part time employees. Working as a warehouse loader is a good entry level job to get your foot in the door of this business. The prospect of upward mobility through the company is always a plus.
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful, however we are required to get the job done in a timely and effective manner. I learned how to have fun when necessary and when to be completely focused on the task at hand. The hardest part of the job was not being able to sit down while having to continuously lift boxes non-stop until the end of your shift. The job was most enjoyable when my coworkers knew how to stay focused on the job while having a good time. I like to be around positive energy when I'm working."
good,Very difficult place to actually get into but i know that when your in it is an excellent career...you have to be on top of your game while driving for them
good,I was called delivery helper. I assisted in getting the packages from the truck to the business or residence. I learned how important it is to have organised workspace and interaction with the customer. The hardest part of the job is conditioning you have to be in shape and ready to run to complete the job in timely manner.
good,"Early morning to noon was my shift, I was looking for a job and so it was decent money for me. I was hard physical labor not everyone can do it, but I manage to stick around until, I found another job."
good,super dirty and super cold In the end I had to end up leaving because they wanted me to do bulk by myself.... and i only get one back for my whole life.
good,人間関係が難しくロボットのような扱いを上司から受ける。派遣と正社員の差が大きく、派遣はひたすら黙々と入力していくだけの作業
good,"work is simple but can be difficult depending on weather & personal heath,benefits are the best part of the job,& you get a raise every year.the longer you stay the more opportunity you have to move up in the company, but you have to stay Very long & show Alot of commitment. Younger Supervisors dont always know what they are doing,some show favoritism,get frustrated easily,ignore requests for help & choose to do work their way.Some older supervisors do better with their employees."
good,the job was very straight foward. help the driver deliver packages to customers homes... was a nice enviroment to work in and not a stressful work enviroment. I enjoyed it though it was seasonal.
good,A typical day is high paced and staying organized is a must. Leadership and supervision skills a must and wisdom is used with each decision made. Being prepared to answer questions and delegate with employees and drivers is a must. Great work environment and working  together as a team is very rewarding. Interacting with others is the most enjoyable. I have learned a lot from my center manager on leadership skills and thinking quickly on decisions that need immediate attention.
good,"i actually enjoyed this job allot. the fast movement, everyone was friendly. the management was ok, not great but ok. allot of heavy lifting, 70+ pounds. most under 70 though."
good,"Excellent company. Nice place to start a career. The day starts early and its ""full throttle "" until the job is done. I would definitely recommend this job for college students looking for part time work."
good,"Package Handlers play a crucial role in the success of UPS, whether they're sorting packages, loading trucks or unloading trucks. No matter your role, you'll work closely with your team to ensure all the work behind the scenes is done safely and successfully. As a result, you're ensuring customers receive their packages on time, directly impacting the bottom line on a global scale."
good,It was a great learning experience for me to be inside and In the field working as a delivery helper . It was seasonal and I would always go back for the seasonal work.
good,"This job puts your multi-tasking skills to the test and also time management. Great place to work, stable. Once you get the hang of it is an easy job."
good,"The job was very fast paced and physically demanding, as you are required to put scan and load a thousand boxes into the trailer in 4 hours. Speed and accuracy was very important, and they stress body mechanics to prevent injury, but most people ended up sacrificing body mechanics to ensure their production was efficient."
good,a work day is very fast paced and very physical. the packages are moving very quickly and you must move just as quick to keep up with the pace. coworkers are very helpful
good,"Seasonal help over the holidays was very fast paced. You don't have time to waste when your schedule is predetermined for your entire day. I did not learn anything from this position that I didn't already know other than how UPS operates internally. The hardest part of the job was keeping my body warm driving around in the winter in Iowa! "
good,"Day to day operations are fast paced and never boring. Slow advancement but good learning opportunities.  Not an equal opportunity employer for females, although working towards balance.  Very conservative business environment.  Customer service quality is most important."
good,"My time spent here was either loading trucks or helping deliver packages as a driver helper. UPS taught me how to sort and organize boxes so that when on delivery, the process is quicker and more sufficient."
good,Sehr gutes geschäft weltweit tätig aber viel stress für alle kuriere
good,I have worked for this company for 4 years and it is flexible but I want something with benefits and better pay. If I was given a raise when needed I would definitely consider this company for a future.
good,You're commended and often rewarded for your hard-work. Shifts are often flexible depending on your co-workers' schedules. You won't be micromanaged if you don't make it necessary.
good,Bests if you have a plan and dont compermise for anything or anyone until you complete your plan or goals . Best I'm sure you will be tested being travel to work on empty gas tank or stomach . Jus make it through the storm
good,"can be overwhelming as this is a fast paced and high demand job and company to work for. depending on the job function and which center you work for, the hours can be long."
good,"Process oriented"
good,A typical day at work consisted of sorting packages in separated connected moving trolleys. The management was friendly yet job security isn't strong.
good,UPS is a great company to work for.  Management can be demanding.  Enjoy working with my customers.  Hardest part of the job is no clear job description
good,Awesome and very friendly group of people to work with. Job is only part time with no benefits but does pay very well. Not real strenuous and very laid back except at christmas time.
good,UPS was a very hardworking job but i enjoyed it. I learned the in's and out's of UPS warehouses. I didnt really get to communicate with my manager there because i was too busy working but he was a nice guy. The workplace was very 'in the zone' and quick place we really had no time to converse with other employees but i liked the work because im a hard worker.
good,"I've breen here a long time and its hard work, hard to have a life outside of work. Your dirty everyday. The pay is ok but most come or stay for the benefits if you have childern."
good,sorting by area codes converter belts and relabeling also ups is a great opportunity to further your career it's also a good opportunity because the part time job with full benefits and also help you were going back to school
good,A quick paced work environment; need the ability to adjust to different work loads with little notice. A higher pay rate would be appreciated. Health insurance is unbeatable.
good,"A good experience.  Typical day to day corporate life, a situation comedy of sorts.  The real enjoyment was the people, guess it is always the people that make or break a place."
good,Over all need a growth in career and place where everyday need to learn something new. need horizontal growth in terms of money. Ready to relocate even if its oversea
good,A typical work day for me included managing my employees and making sure all the work got done in time. The hardest part was really keeping tabs on everyone at the same time. I learned a lot about to to effectively manage and had great leaders to show me the ropes of management.
good,They have awesome benefits that they offer for not only you but also for you family... they work you like under paid slaves though.... overall ok place
good,Management will take advantage of you if you work hard. They will make it very hard to say no to work after you're done with our load. They're always looking to fire an employee to prove that they are doing their job.
good,"UPS is a fast paced, hectic working environment. I learned to give everything I have at work. The one thing I enjoy about the job is that the job is a workout in itself."
good,"•	Take and study orders for package picking and ensure that they are understood properly."
good,"a typical work day was to do data entry, as a part time job was enough, you could hear music, while coding. I learned to type faster, management was great. The hardest part of the job was, maybe, because of the recession, that your work depends on people sending packages. "
good,"I had worked here almost thirty years ago, UPS is no longer privately owned. I did not enjoy my time here, there was a discrimination against women. I like to think women are now treated fairly at UPS."
good,"Easy work for lousy pay. Good for a side job because of the late hours, i worked the 10:30-3am shift. Wasn't bad, just loaded trucks with mail or be on the belt throwing boxes to trucks"
good,A typical day at work is starting off with making sure everything is in order and safe for the employees. Making sure they are matched up with the correct unloader to maintain the pace. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the individuals to stay calm when they start to get frustrated. The most enjoyable part of the job is reaching the goal and coming out successful. Everyone leaves happy and the day has been productive.
good,Work place was a little under organized you didn't get many hours not a set schedule ....work was easy an simple....managers were kinda all over the place an always new people coming so made things hard for current workers when they wouldn't train new workers .
good,The sense of urgency is critical to working at UPS. You must also become well-adapted to your environment. It is also critical that you take stock in completing your own training.
good,"This is my first job, I learn a lot while working here, they have a good working system and they trained all employee before can start perfoming our duty."
good,"Drive a large vehicle, more than 8 hours a day, making 100-200 stops depending on the route both residential and commercial. Heavy lifting, lots of walking on uneven surfaces. Great benefits."
good,"It's a good place to work,  weekly pay,  good benefits,  ups has a union,  every 6 months there was a 50¢ raise and a $1.00 raise every year of employment"
good,Enjoyed the fast paced and team oriented environment under the management of people who truly cared about the wellbeing of their employees and the satisfaction of their customers.
good,"Show up at 8:30 for a crew meeting, then study my load and arrange things the best you could for your run.  You got to know your run like the back of your hand in no time.  I enjoyed how busy and how efficient I could get."
good,tres agréable dans cette boite le peut de temps ne ma pas laissé en apprécié la chose
good,The work expectation for each package handler loading trucks is high. Mangers will push each employer to their best potential to fullfill companies expectations. Its a very face paced job requiring a lot of stamina and being able to make quick decisions while loading trucks. The benefits are the most attractive part about working for UPS because it offers decent health insurance to hard working people along with paid vacations and other employment opportunities.
good,"It is hard job but very rewarding.. supervisors are good people and help train and prepare you for driving and delivering of packages. It is an easy job once you get your locations down but can be physically exhausting.. Great pay, but hard job.."
good,a typical workday starts around 2 or 3 AM and ends around 8 AM.  we normally would get 1 15 minute break in the day unless it is peak season.  other than the short break it is a great place to work.
good,"This job is a seasonal job , but it was great because I loge being active and also outside, you also learn costumer service skills with this job because you have to interact with business owners who have big shipments"
good,"Loading/unloading, mail sorting, scanning, verify labels, walk belt, break jams, sort packages."
good,"it was productive and a lot of miss organization,not enough people.the supervisors wouldn't bother helping just be on there phones and not the right equipment to do the job right"
good,"Exercising "
good,"The work was extremely physical with lots of lifting, pushing, pulling, bending, etc. There was a lot of stress placed on the body but the work was fast paced which made the day go by quickly."
good,If you can get into this job then take it. Its fast paced and will get you into shape. long hard days but they pay your for the work you preform. They try sometimes.
good,I have nothing good to say about the management that did not hear out any employee with issues and just cared about top production even if it was dangerous at times.
good,I was a delivery driver for R&S Crafts and delivered many different arrangements to many different events. I was able to gain valuable time management skills while following strict mapped out routes.
good,"Great place to work someone looking to gain real life experience at a younger age, someone just out of high school or in the midsts of working on a four year college degree."
good,"Unload package cars, training and guide employees to loading trucks. Going over the safety aspect of working at UPS. Safe by choice and not by chance."
good,"Had some mild cattiness but that comes with any interaction with people.  Work can agitate and aggravate anybody which can cause attitudes among the team. But other than that, sweet people."
good,"I started here as a handler and quickly became a supervisor. Day to day operations were the typical ""go faster"" mentality. Overall it was good but the occasional employee would slack off behind the cover of the union"
good,"When i first started working there, it felt like slave labor, slowly graduating to a more easier workflow as long as you can keep a steady pace through the workday. Working holidays killed me, working 12 hour shifts every day for a whole months and a half. Now they cut our hours giving us time to do more work in less than 4 hours time"
good,"Not always organized, but its a fast paced job that gets your heart pumping in the morning. The fast pace helps make the time seem like it's going by fast. Good benefits. Wish there was more of a chance to stick on after the holiday season."
good,"Structure un peu à part d'UPS, localisé sur les Chantiers de l'Atlantique pour le suivi de colis lors de la construction du bateau."
good,"I loved my UPS Job SCS Healtcare."
good,nothing was typical at this business.  I enjoyed every moment until the sizes and weights of shipments became more than I could handle.  Enjoyed all the people I met.
good,"good school benefits "
good,"Working in the Samsung/Hanwa Techwin department, generally the most busiest time of the account was the last 5 days of the month (The last day of the month usually consisted of working 16+hours). The other times, if there were not enough orders to fulfill, you were shipped off to another account in need. I manage to learn a lot about shipping packages (especially international) through UPS & Fed Ex. as well as working with the system GWS. The hardest part of the job was when management would prioritize other accounts ahead of ours and would take labor from us, even if we were busy, and move them to other accounts. They always 'shot from the hip' and never seemed to have a solid gameplan for the near future, thus making the work more difficult to accomplish in a timely fashion. The environment was amazingly clean for a warehouse, but were seemingly treated as if you belong in elementary school (using safety games to reinforce the culture of safety as one example) The most enjoyable aspect of the job was to always try to be the most efficient and accurate individual at any task I was thrown at. There was also my colleagues in that particular department, which was always a joy to see each day."
good,"Working at UPS is no easy task. But if you decide to make that decision, it will pay off. Full benefits for part-time workers.Tuition reimbursement. Amongst other perks."
good,"Working with drivers is a fun thing to do. You will spend anywhere from 4-6 hours with the driver helping them with their deliveries. Overall it was an enjoying work environment, the only issue was how I was laid off when the season ended. I did not receive a call or any notification. I found out when I went to the hub to collect a paycheck."
good,"The overall culture of the workplace was very safe, fast, and efficient. I imagine it would feel like the environment you'd find in a factory when in the main shipping center, and while out on the routes it feels more like going to the gym."
good,"Fun and exciting"
good,If not for the supervisor who was set to injure me out of the company. I was trying hard to wait out the supervisor in order to keep the job I liked. I was Informed the Supervisor was transferred after application of the wrongful termination lawsuit.
good,No reward for hard work. Workers who show initiative are given more work. Those who are lazy but unionized get less work. Management tends to micromanage. Hard to move up in company. Physically demanding job. Not for weak minded.
good,"I was led astray with this position."
good,I worked for the United Parcel Service for over ten years. I was a package delivery driver and enjoyed the ability to work mainly outdoors. they provided benefits and a retirement package.
good,i started off as a loader then became a driver. there's was not really anything easy about this job. but they do pay really good. the medical is outstanding.
good,Awesome parttime job with full benefits.  Great for college student and working adults.  Able to gain leadership experience
good,I enjoyed working at this facility.  I drove UPS Freight and was a dock handler.  It was hard work but enjoyed every minute.
good,I is a great company to work for.  I learned the required work that is put into making sure customers receive there packages on time.
good,"Its A Well Balanced Job That Put You Through Some Physicality but Its Well Balanced "
good,"Gute Arbeit, gute Bezahlung."
good,Good work and life balance however there is no job security until you become union after 45 days clocked. As well 4 of the 5 supervisors are rude and power hungry.
good,I worked with UPS for seven years and it was a great experience which built my career and overall growth. It was very diverse therefore I was able to learn global procurement practices.
good,il lavoro consiste nel consegnare pacchi bisogna sapersi organizzare xche le consegne sono tante e ogni cliente ha degli orari diversi di solito si fanno delle consegne alla andata e delle altre al ritorno . i colleghi di lavoro erano tutti abbastanza corretti anche se il rapporto era molto distaccato x via che si lavorava ognuno x conto proprio .
good,"Cool seasonal job, when you get assigned to a driver, you work up to 40 hours a week, plus overtime. The breaks were short though."
good,"Managed a group of multi aged, multi cultured employees to process packages and hit production goals on an hourly basis.  I was responsible for making sure production, safety, and service goals were achieved."
good,Great Entry Job. And very good benefits after a year.Hard word but has really good career opportunities. Really good workout.
good,Pretty good job. The holidays can be rough with the crazy schedules and long days. So many packages can make it stressful at times.  Its hard to get a fulltime delivery job because of the list being so long.
good,"Contratti più lunghi e più collaborazione tra colleghi "
good,"I enjoy this job because it's very easy to learn but very easy to get comfortable in. The work is very common, someone is always shipping something or returning a online package."
good,"Typical day includes shipping and packing customer's packages. Separating mail, printing, and organizing the store. "
good,"Great company to to work for and offers a wide range of benefits. Competitive pay, and can work you for very long hours, especially during the peak season."
good,"Work went by fast and things usually went smoothly. The management was alright, not everyone was on the same page.The hardest part was getting all the packages to fit in the places they need to go. I enjoyed the people the most."
good,I took a skilled role that I was getting paid part time for while working on a Masters Degree. I chose to move on because with a Master's degree I was looking for more.
good,"I enjoyed working for UPS, typical day was intense levels of unloading or loading. I learned how to move and work efficiently as a team member quickly to reach our team goals which were processing 35%-50% of the volume (usually 70k-85k per night) by 1:30am. Management was stern but diligent and well-respected. Working among UPS staff we became family. The job wasn't tough really, but working two jobs because entry-level pay sucks (excuse my language) it became strenuous on my body. Being around the intense environment was enjoyable."
good,The work was tough but this was a fun place to work. The working conditions were shaky at best but the pay was good. The management wasn't very active in training.
good,"Great people to work with.  Pretty lenient with staff.  Hard work for the shift, only one 10 minute break regardless of how many hours were worked.  And 10 minutes means 10 minutes.  Fast paced environment."
good,Being a seasonal driver is a challenging yet enjoyable job. Every day is different. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that customers are getting their packages because of me.
good,"We Unloaded at least 10 trucks Everyday."
good,"This was a great job love the friendly leads, an supervisior that they had there wonderful hours an benefits that was available and the union was awesome."
good,great experience if you'd consider being a delivery driver in the future. My job was to take the packages to the door that's it very easy and customers are always nice. Typical day was about 200-250 stops per day. On peak day was 300+ stops which is the next work day after Christmas. The hardest part of the job is the weather really rainy days are worst then the snow days. You could bring snacks and drinks on the truck with you and the most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,It is a good place to work. It is face-paced work. Everyone is nice there. The work day ends when all the boxes have been loaded on the trucks.
good,Busy environment but fast paste like I like it. Team players its better to work together. Mangers get down and dirty and help out. I also got to meet new people
good,I enjoyed working with the driver's I was assigned to assist. The fast pace of the job really makes the work day go by quickly. I also liked how the driver's would assist each other in finishing routes if/when they finished their own routes early.
good,Dealing with clients and reps on a daily basis was the biggest challenge. Studying trends and building portfolios was the one of the most rewarding parts of the job. Implementing policies and procedures was what made this job the most challenging.
good,Well while working and ups I have experienced pore service and I don't like it. This has been a bad experience for me and I wouldn't recommended that anyone apply to this job because they don't follow protocol and rarely give you breaks .
good,"UPS is a great company to work for, and offers many opportunities for advancement if in the right field/area. Management was very friendly and made me feel at home. The setback was the temporary nature of the position."
good,I as not there long enough to fully understand the company but the drivers and management were friendly and caring about any injuries that might occur.
good,"I loved my job at UPS, I was able to learn and grow.  Days were hectic but we had a great team and we were all very good at working together.  However, they were long days away from my family."
good,The UPS store is a fine job for a teen or someone looking for extra income.  The owner of the store I worked at was hardly ever there.  The customers were mostly great.
good,"Although I was seasonal, UPS was a very good job choice at that moment. The benefits if your working full time and part time were amazing! The hardest part of my job was making sure our full truck load of packages were empty at the end of our work shift. Great employees!"
good,"Although I have been out of work full time for the last couple of years taking care of my mother I still maintained a part-time job working on weekends doing different security jobs that my services has been requested..I learned that ove the last 10+years how to become patient, understanding and also different coping skills on how to resolve a situation before it is esculated."
good,"I was an unloader in the hub. In the summer it was hot, and in the winter cold. We unloaded packages at a fast pace and there were days I'd get home and wring the sweat out of my clothes."
good,"Great opportunities to advance your career. Hard, fast paced environment but will pay off. Everyone works hard and is involved every step of the way."
good,"People get things done, packages get delivered, trucks get packed,"
good,Rewarding place to work and move into management. Can work long hours and weekends especially during the Christmas holiday season
good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping customers with over the counter medicine, checking inventory, being a cashier, closing out credit card sales."
good,UPS Canada is a good place to work. There is a lot of politics in the company around promotion process. The company does have some good people with great skills and vision.
good,"En typisk arbetsdag för mig är att se till så att den dagliga operationen i helhet fungerar, Planera tid och plats i fordonen samt assistera våran kundtjänst i vissa frågor."
good,Fun and good people to work with. A brotherhood relationship established immidiately. Fair and professional leadership by management.
good,"The hardest part of the job is there are no breaks its tiring and the hours don""t really show up on your check.Its very time consuming because everything is based on time and you got to be quick and on your feet in order to progress in the company. The cons of it is an injury can happen at any time so you have to be very careful and quick with a time remaining still."
good,Detail and process driven / degree of administrative complexity / outstanding performance and visibility / limited ability for customer individualization of account needs
good,"The typical work day was busy throughout with a constant flow of packages that needed to be loaded. The way package handlers such as myself were taught to load made the task at hand much easier. Teamwork and safety were the cornerstones of working at UPS. With proper technique, safety, and teamwork, efficiency followed and it was easy to last a full shift without feeling overwhelmed."
good,This job is good for people who need a job as a stepping stone through life. The union is strong and good. Work environment is a little harsh buy nothing you cant adapt to.
good,"A typical day as a package handler is unloading or loading packages into a trailer that ranges from 30 to 50 feet."
good,days started at night. they give you trucks to unload in a certain amount of time. base your pay on how well you work. got a raise in less than 5 months. was pushed to become a driver. only thing that wasn't so great were the hours. 4 hours everyday with the weekends off. 4.5 hours if you decided to stay after and wash a truck for an extra thirty minutes. supervisors seemed to not like each other and when assigned to do a task another would tell you to do something different and have you constantly seeking validation on what to do.
good,Ups was very challenging yet very rewarding job.you had to be sharp both physically and mentally.i watched it transistion from pen and paper delivery to the logistical giant it is today.
good,"great benefits and hours, holidays and wonderful people.  Very fast paced.  Very hot working environment but you get used to it."
good,"An overall good company to work for. Good work environment with a great team to work with everyday. The pay could be better and at times, there is not enough work for a full shift."
good,"Working for UPS as a drivers helper was a good way to make money during the holiday season. Although I was not hired for full-time work, I had an overall good experience while being employed there."
good,"My job at UPS is very challenging, yet rewarding. In my management role I am given an opportunity to help others help themselves.  I have learned a myriad of new HR and management  skills through online learning at the UPS University and hands on daily work, this coupled with my previous employment and a life time of job experience, my time at UPS has allowed me to hire and support many hundreds of employees. "
good,"Absolutely loved the job and the people I worked with.  Upper management was awful.  Treated employees very badly and made threats against employees all the time.  From my start date to my end date, employee recognition went from great to into the toilet."
good,the people at the job are very nice the job allows you to have freedom when your out on the road doing deliveries it was a seasonal position
good,The UPS store was a fun and busy environment. There was always someone coming in with unusual and interesting items to be packed and shipped.
good,"Ups isn't a bad place to work. But in my opinion I believe the work conditions we has to endure as employees made it not worth it. No benefits for a year but we barely have decent airflow during the hottest days of the summer. There were no breaks, the management was a bit unorganized. They also didn't  know how to utilize their good workers."
good,"As a part-time Pre-Loader I worked from 3am to 9am, Monday through Friday. When they say that this is a fast-paced environment they mean it. I started off only loading 3 trucks but eventually they bumped me up to 4 trucks. From the time I clocked in to the time I clocked out it was non-stop movement."
good,This company would run a lot better if everything was based on performance instead of seniority. Guys who been there for a long time with higher pay rates don't do much work. New employees do the majority of the work for the least amount of pay.
good,A typical day would getting told the safety type for the day than be sent to the trailers to unload. What I learned was how to unload trailers without getting hurt and getting the packages on other trailers. Management would help it got to hot in the trailers to let us have a quick break to rest before going back to work. My co-works were all nice to help me if I really needed it with the packages that I'm not able to move. The hardest part was only getting 10 minutes break than getting back to work didn't really help me sometimes. the enjoyable part was when everyone would be joking around with one another.
good,"You just move boxes from the line and stack them on the trucks. not that hard, was fun, but it was hot during the summer. The one thing about the job is that you got some long hours but the money is good"
good,"During initial hiring process you are told repeatedly that it is easy to move up within the company.  This is only partly true.  The vast number of employees will most likely not see a promotion for several years.  Some of the promotion process comes from the luck of your initial placement within the company, some comes from who you know in the company.  While I was able to work my way up, learn, and grow, I was repeatedly deceived by upper management in many areas.  I take this opportunity as a learning experience and will use my skills and knowledge to better myself within other companies."
good,"Being a snowboard instructor was great because I got to work with kids and learn a lot about myself through teaching. I found that in the beginning I wasn't as good of a teacher as I thought I was, but through practicing the skill, I became more confident in teaching large groups how to snowboard in the end."
good,"good company to start your work with, Work Culture is good and Provides good facilities to employees, employee oriented Company and allows to follow u the rule"
good,"good hours, decent benefits I went through a temp service so they let me go because of hours people are friendly and nice sometimes its an easy job sometimes its challenging and different"
good,"Constantly busy, learned how to ship and handle packages, management is okay, co-workers are lazy, hardest part is dealing with customers that disagree with time arrivals and prices that you have no control over, and the most enjoyable part of the job is having customers who appreciate your work."
good,"Days were usually laid-back with lots of free time. Mostly scanned in ""drop off"" packages and created shipping labels. Must be able to take measurements and use best judgement when packaging items."
good,"Overall great entry level job.  Work mostly consist of logistics, mailbox, printing, and notary services.  Learned cash handling and phone experience."
good,Its a hard working environment to deal with. I've preloaded trucks for delivery. Also Im a package handler delivering packages to businesses and residential buildings .
good,"Great job for spring and summer time, your always out and it's very easy going. Your pretty much work most of the time so the day goes by fairly quick. Good job overall."
good,Excellent company to learn new skills to help succeed in the future.  Company has flexible work schedules and prides itself on promoting from within.  Wealth of opportunity
good,"Job requires a lot of work in short shifts.  Its a physically demanding job, so be willing to work hard and do a lot in a short amount of time."
good,I enjoyed my time at UPS. It was a good place to work in that required a person to learn good working skills and time management.
good,"At UPS, I started working at a young age, and worked my way through college. In this time I learned life values and created vision as to where and how I wanted to pursue my career. UPS and my aspirations did not align leaving me to make the decision to leave and pursue my goals."
good,"Great company to work for. I enjoy commutating with the customers, and solving their shipping issues. I learn great customer service"
good,Extremely hard work with lots of heavy lifting. They offer a lot of benefits tho such as tuition reimbursement and dental insurance. I enjoyed working with the staff they are all hardworking people.
good,i would come in and see if ne thing needs picking up to be shipped then would pick it up if not then ne thing already there needed to be packed then would do sorting of mail. I learned a lot about shipping and packing of different materials my boos was great person always willing to help n great fun  co workers made the environment great to work in  hardest park was picking up of packages n most enjoyable was the packing of them fun place to be ...
good,Honestly all you get out of this job is how to do your own taxes for the rest of your life. They pay horribly for the first year. They take all your commissions. I just didn't like it. you get paid less than a MacDonald's worker. (no offense)
good,"I really enjoyed working here at the gateway hub sky harbor."
good,"Hard work, but I am not afraid of working so it was fine. Difficult hours during the holiday times. Never knew what the weather was going to be like."
good,"Work place is very active and keeps you in shape. With it never being a down time, you never get restless or bored. Management was involved in helping with overloaded work."
good,"Very fast paced. Can be demanding. Need to be ZEN. Once conveyors start must stay focused, easy to fall behind, not easy to catch up. Before you know it. It is time to go home. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"The typical work day consisted of managing inventory, handling sales and packaging of shipments. Up-sale and/or cross-sales when available. The managers where not there very often and at times were rather difficult to get a hold of when problems arise. My co-workers were good team players, and we solved issues through communication. The job became more difficult due to physical ailments that came up. As much as i enjoyed working for UPS, I could no longer handle lifting/ moving of large objects."
good,"Constant work, great benefits but they over work you with not enough raises. They did supply lunch every so often. Certain shifts got certain privileges which wasn't ok."
good,"Would come into the warehouse and load the packages in chronological order, as well as neatly, into the trucks I was assigned too, for the drivers to deliver to the customers in a timely manner."
good,"Great hours, and an awesome work environment. It was a pleasure working here last winter. My position was only temporary and seasonal but I would definitely recommend this job to anyone looking for a job for the holidays."
good,It was a good job would've stayed but school got in the way even though it was hot sometimes with limited breaks the job was my first and every time since then I've always wanted to keep a job.
good,"Working at this company was great. They taught me how to deal with conflict, and how to multitask when I'm working in a fast paced enviorment."
good,"I enjoyed working as driver helper in 2014 because I worked with the same driver every day I worked. In 2015 I had to work with 5 different drivers at different times, It was chaotic. I got bit by a dog and since there was no bleeding the supervisor did nothing & told me I could not call animal control."
good,Fast paced environment dealing with the continual lifting lowering and carrying of parcels. High degree of difficulty and performance expectations
good,"I served customers to meet their satisfaction needs in a fast pace environment, especially on the weekends. I enjoyed helping customers."
good,I would do 80-100 deliveries a day and about 30 pickups. It kept me moving and on my feet.  It was seasonal work and did not last long.
good,"working hours was 8 hours and 6 days a week. It was not really hard job it was more sensitive in focusing in quality and quick work.my manger was sportive and that helped me to learn in short time. the best things it was the life of team work it was really great team. i felt i was lucky. only one thing was upset me little bit it was not enough paid but i was trying get experience more than caring about money. the hardest was covering and solving previous shift time because i will have to deal with all accounting stuff in mooring with the bank which only me can do that,"
good,"I have worked for UPS for 3 months "
good,"A typical day consisted of sorting mail, packing items, entering data, and basic office skills. If there was available time we would do online class training."
good,"Good seasonal workplace,flexible schedule work hours,helpful co-workers,good management,clean workplace,give out free beverages and food for employees,"
good,"Just like any other job. Clocked in, did are job, went home. Co-workers were great. Met a lot of cool people. The hardest part of the job was 53' trailers. Those things could hold anywhere from 800 packages to 2500 packages. You also had to unload them by hand."
good,"While this was my first job, it taught me discipline, and how to conduct myself in a work environment. I would say the hard part about this job was unloading a sears truck by myself once a night, but it was very productive."
good,"work is hard labor and requires you to be physically and mentally read to get through the work day, also co-workers are easy and fun to work with"
good,"Good work environment, good pay scale.  I am looking for a change to give me more of a challenge, perhaps in sales. Excellent retirement benefits."
good,"I usually tracked incoming and outgoing loads, dispatching and importing documents into the feeder system. Had A great time working and being able to improve my typing and customer service skills."
good,"I worked for UPS part time at the UPS Store so I can't speak to all of the aspects of a career there, however I really enjoyed working at UPS. Learning the how the UPS system for shipping works has also proved invaluable at other jobs and in my personal life. I worked in a small UPS store and frequently finished my shifts alone so all of the responsibility for shipping deadlines, cash, closing, printing etc were mine, which kept me challenged to see each shift  if I could do better than the last time. Customer service is central and learning how to juggle multiple stressful activities while people wait for you was par for the course i.e. setting up a PO box for one person while accepting drop off packages for five or more people at once."
good,A typical day of work for me is Loading and unloading merchandise off and on pallets located in the storeroom. The overnight team wors very hard.
good,A typical day at work is 10 hours long. If its our peak time you could work up to 12 hours a day 4 to 6 days a week. The bosses are friendly and the people are also friendly.
good,Great company to work for and do business with. they have a great management team that helps you reach your set goals. I would recommend them to anyone.
good,Everyone at UPS is friendly and always good to interact with. The job was fast paced and sometimes physically demanding but never came as an issue to me being a collegiate athlete.
good,Its a good place to start with but I dont see myself working there in along term. The work hours are flexible and a fun place to work.
good,"Pack tailors with boxes, then unpack tailors full of boxes."
good,Assist as a helper delving customer packages.  Worked with various drivers and all where easy to work with.  Would like to have one place to drive to work found it challenging to have to meet up with each driver and leaving my car in various parking lots for him to pick me up.
good,"UPS est un grand groupe qui permet une évolution constante."
good,i liked working there. I like working because it was fun and fast paced.MY coworkers were cool and calm. the hardest part was keeping focused at such a fast pace.
good,Worked 3 part time shifts for company over course of employment. Job is very hard physically lifting anywhere for less than one pound to 70 pounds individually and up to 150 with help.  Management isn't union and most supervisors are young and inexperienced.  GREAT benefits and pay is really good with raises every year.
good,some mangers were great to work for and i loved them others i hated working for the ocmpnay.  its a hit or miss company for sure
good,"Always busy, a lot of work to do but its a typical warehouse. Stuff is heavy so eat your wheaties. Get paid well and overtime is always available."
good,UPS is a very hard and demanding job. I liked it though. The pay is good and there is always room to move up higher in the ranks.
good,"trabajo bajo mucha presion"
good,"My department is the busiest and the brain center for the entire company. For the amount of responsibility that is required, the specialist in the department should be compensated more."
good,"As a UPS driver the day is filled will spur of the moment decisions,but at the same time can be pretty orderly. Teamwork is a must and everyone seems to be able to work together to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say is sometimes trying to get straight answers in a timely fashion from management about some policies/situations. What I loved most about it is being outside getting to see a ton of different or the same people every day and being active."
good,A day at work here was generally busy answering phones about tracking numbers and shipments. I also work with other UPS employees around the world.
good,ups was a great place to work.  I had to ability to make decisions that impacted the day to day operations of the company.  I had the opportunity to get to know a vast number of people and learn a wealth of knowledge in management of people.
good,"Everyday we loaded the packages, its a workout in itself so no need for the gym. Great benefits, full health care. Very team like staff."
good,"At this job you are everything except the host, because they seat themselves, or have assigned seating. it is very chaotic, fast paced, and trains your memory center to engage itself."
good,working at U.P.S. was altogether new for me I never loaded trucks before they trained me and show the what when and how to do the work in a very short point of time It is good work but it was only seasonable
good,"Very easy to learn the day to day job requirements."
good,"Good and fun but serious work."
good,Safety plays a big part and hardwork is what should be prepared for if interested. easy job if you have the right mentality
good,"The SCM (Service Center Manager) is great to work with.  However, Upper Management doesn't provide incentive to stay with the company.  When the removed the pention from the benefits package for the Management it left them without a leg to stand on. Keeping good motivated Supervisor/Management may be difficult unless the change there business strategy."
good,"A night at UPS entailed us unloading around 50 trucks a night. I learned to stick with the job through the bad times and good times, respect managers, be a team player, become a leader to motivate other employers during long nights, and ultimately have fun with everything. The managers and co-workers treated us very well, and valued our work ethics to get the jobs done in a timely manner. Me and all my coworkers worked well together as a team and competed with each other to see who could unload truck faster to keep a light atmosphere. The hardest part about the job was adapting to the hard physical labor in the beginning, but eventually everyone gets used to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun with fellow co-workers and supervisors to make the nights go by quicker."
good,I worked with a UPS delivery driver and my typical work day lasted about five hours. I had a good rapport with the driver and the customers that we served. In all it was a rewarding experience.
good,"Working there was one of the best jobs I've had growing up. Since I was a college student, they were very flexible with the scheduling. Typically, I'd come in and check our social media profiles, respond to any notifications and then proceed to man the counter. The pay was good for a student and overall office environment was comfortable."
good,"A typical week as a 'Peak' season employee at UPS consisted of 40+ hours of work. The time frame of work was inconvenient for me, we worked 12 A.M - 10 A.M. most days, Monday - Friday. The money was good because they paid time and a half when you pass 40 hours in a work week. I felt over worked in the Peak Season because i often loaded four trucks of 250+ packages each, while other workers would load three. The company gives no one full-time employment until you become either a driver, which can take upwards of three years as a part-timer to get a chance at the test, or a Full-time Supervisor which takes a Bachelors' Degree or above in something UPS can use (Logistics, etc.) All in all, the experience was worth while, but when a part-time job becomes a full-time dedication with little to no real benefits at the time, it becomes harder each day to keep morale high enough to want to continue. The only reason i ceased to continue employment here was because i relocated to North Carolina."
good,"Working for UPS was a hard and yet rewarding job, there is always something going on and always a job that needs doing.  Can be quite stressful but the managers and staff are always helping each other out, there is a great sense of team playing with this company"
good,Always good to see my co-workers every morning and also good to have a great team to work with. That makes the job and day go by good.
good,"This particular UPS branch is not the best nor the cleanest warehouse. They are efficient in getting their mail out, but very unorganized with there shifts and break rooms."
good,UPS is a good company to work for it offers the union for protection and has a benefits package that is affordable. In the three hours I am their I am using concentration along with physical skills combined to load 1000 packages in those three hour I am on the clock.
good,Great place to work if you're lucky to get a full time position. The workers are very helpful and are willing to help one another anytime.
good,"A typical day would be to come in and go exactly to work. Whether it be covering someone's lunch right away, helping a customer as I come into my workplace, or help maintain cleanliness throughout my area. I've furthered my experience with customer service with this job."
good,Delivering packages to various customers and businesses in an safe and timely manner. Follow DOT regulations. Provide great cutomer service and appearance .
good,"Strenuous job for a lot of people though its good for part time work."
good,"UPS is a fast paced, on your feet type job; it can be stressful at times but the work payed off in the end makes up for it. If you like hard manual labor then you will be bound to enjoy it."
good,Very hard work both mentally and physcally.  Compensation package is great and the medical benifits are the best that I have ever had.
good,"everyday in work, we helping drop off customer, we helping shipping customer and mail box customer, each have different needed. my supervisor was there everyday and helping me if I have any trouble or problem I'm facing"
good,I liked what I did but it was kind of routine and basic throughout the day. You knew what was going to be done that day and you just had to ride it out each day.
good,even been one of the most solids corporation on the entire glove the lack off support for the lower management employees by the upper management have make this place ruff to work in.
good,"Fun job, great manager. I enjoyed the people and clients. I worked at the front desk and also special events to bring in walk in clients to the salon."
good,More like the night shift I did was fun. Come in unload and load trucks. Make sure to always watch your step and head. Management is cool as long as you do your work. I enjoyed the work. To bad I had to move.
good,face pace job. keeps your physically fit.keeps you focused and goal oriented. Safety Awareness becomes a habit and practically applicable in daily life.
good,typical day at work starts off lazy but once you get used to it. feels like nothing. i get along with just about everybody. everybody is friendly.
good,"Help the driver of the route with making deliveries."
good,Drive-thru and front counter team member. Take orders either face to face or threw headset in drive thru. Handle and make change to customer. Hand food and drinks on a timely manner.
good,very supportive working environment. every worker is ready to help out with each others duties and that makes working there a great experience.
good,Soon as you hit the warehouse your on the move. You have to be in shape to work a fast pace job like that one. It was ok for me. The benefits are ok.
good,"Overview of staffing for the day. Planning a day that is cost effective and enables me to service our clientel. During regular season we service 15k-19k daily. During our 'peak' hours which are generally the holiday season we service up to 30k daily. I make about $72,000 yearly. I work 12-16 hours daily. The hardest part about the job are the hours I report to work at 12 midnight and work until 12 noon or until the job is complete. And during the holiday we start as early as 10pm and work as late as 4pm the following day. The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching and counseling my work group. I learned how to multi task, ensure safety, organize, accountability, leadership, time management and how to run cost effectively and still service our customers effectively and efficiently."
good,My typical work day consisted of picking up and delivering of packages on a strict timeframe.  I was responsible for maintaining good customer relationships and obtaining new accounts.  I learned the importance of safe driving skills.  The most difficult part of the job was battling ice storms making the job more challenging.  Interacting with the public was the most enjoyable part of this job.
good,"The job is fairly easy, most of the people you'll work with will be honest hard working people. The company has an excellent benefits program, and is great for would be college students."
good,This position at UPS freight has provided me with an insight into leadership and interactions with other business outlets. The position continuous t provide day to day challenges dealing with direct reports and customers further strengthening my business acumen.
good,I learned a lot working at West Jefferson Hospital. I started as a supply tech but became a EMT and Hyperbaric tech. Lots of advancement opportunity.
good,"I enjoyed working at Bargreen Ellinson, Inc. I enjoyed working there and learning new skills, such as the cherry picker."
good,I love my job and a typical day at work is opening the store at 8:00 am get register ready for our customers. I have worked with customers for about 20 years. I have learned a lot working at the UPS Store we all have to know how to take of your customer like packing their item before they are shipped out. I feel the management could be a little controlled because I never worked at a place where you can come to work late and get fired and hire back at the same day. If was the manager there would be a lot of changes in the store. My co-worker is good to work with if they are watching what they are doing. The hardest part of my job are lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of my job is we all get along and my boss is wonderful and sometimes understanding.
good,IF you like working hard an do not mind working I think it is a good  place to work. UPS do have good benefits. If you are just coming in the work field I think its a good thing.
good,UPS is a company that I would have to say holds their company name to the quality it provides by securing that the associates provide quality in their work as well as satify customers in good timing.
good,"Management and other staff members are a very good team and we all work together every shift."
good,"Open Programs, LMS, SAP, Outlook Reports"
good,This was a great job in which i had fun because i like seeing people happy. my typical work day consisted of checking out items and packing bags. the hardest part of this job is keeping the people who come happy because people get mad when you mess up their sales. i enjoyed my coworkers they gave the family vibe made me feel right at home.
good,"This company taught me hardworking skills through different jobs at the company. The company paid for all of my education and has free health insurance. The company is part of a union, but it guarantees that you get a raise every year."
good,I loved it at UPS but I don't agree with the short time frame you have for days off. I have to say that I might recommend this job to someone
good,"very laid back, not much customer traffic, not much room for growth, very little supervision, great staff very reliable, flexible scheduling."
good,This was an interesting employment opportunity. The most enjoyable part is the enviroment that comes with working here. You are a part of a big team but at the same time independent.
good,great learning experience in customer service and learning more about the retail business and logistics and how to keep people safe at doing their job.
good,"During my time at UPS I did plenty around the store, from processing to organizing to dealing with customers. One of the funniest thing I remembered while working was how UPS chargers their packages by size as opposed to other companies. My manager was always very friendly and helpful. My coworkers were very understanding during my training and helped out plenty. The hardest part of my job would have been processing packages, and the most enjoyable part would have been working with the costumers."
good,A good place to work with supportive and understandable management. Many opportunities for growth and advancement. I would recommend this job to any one who is looking for a career.
good,I enjoy the game at hand.  I like the fast pace and the challenge to get all the work out and to stay on task.  I like to get the process the paperwork and get it too the dock work.
good,With this job came with a better understanding of daily logistics that are involved in order to make this company run well and to give customers exceptional customer service.
good,"Overall, working with UPS is a relatively easy job. My difficulty is with being separated from my family all week. It also becomes significantly more challenging when work schedules fluctuate from day to night, week to week. The work is physically demanding and little time is available for personal health and fitness, which ultimately is necessary to maintain a good work conditioning."
good,"Great training personnel that help along the way.  They are very tuned in to newbies needs. This is rather difficult physical work,  it's a great place to get a full work out five days a week."
good,A typical work day I would load 4 trucks at one time. This meant I had to not only be physically ready at 4 am but also mentally ready. I learned more about the supply chain in this job. As to having people buy online then that goes to UPS then it is delivered to the customer. Management was very hands on. They would walk around and also help employees that were falling behind. My co-workers were very nice and also worked very hard to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was starting early and the pace being so fast. I would show up early just to get stretched out and also wake up my brain so I was ready when it was time to start. The most enjoyable part of the job would have been not making many mistakes by where I placed certain packages in the truck. This showed who was the most aware of what truck they were putting packages on and where they were putting them.
good,too much work for one person need two people in one trucks its usually one person in a truck but supervisor makes one person per three trucks.
good,The company I worked for had an interesting way of treating their employees. Everything has a way of coming to the light. I enjoyed my position  when I had it.
good,Decent amount of red tape and politics but that is expected of a big company. How high you go is dependent on how hard you work and network.
good,Fast paced office. I learned about international freight forwarding.  The hardest part of this job-long and late hours. The most enjoyable part-working with the in/ outbound drivers.
good,"all about logistics, got to finish days objective or wont go home until done. but will work with you if you have obligations. benefits and is a union job"
good,"It's not UPS, it's the UPS Store and they are not affiliated. I enjoyed greeting the customers and helping them. The manager was very nice."
good,"Well managed with very specific work laid out so there is little guess work. Work is physical and as long as you are healthy it builds you up. Goals are specific. Very little hidden agendas. Management can be very pushy about production but the union is very strong and protects workers from intimidation which does occur frequently."
good,"Fast Paced and challenging work environment which encourages creative problem solving in an effort to satisfy customer needs. Work culture also tends to promote brotherhood between employees and in most cases between management and labor force as well. Competitive pay and good benefits. "
good,Since being employed I would not say the company is an enjoyable company to work for. I feel as if management is very unappreciative towards the workers as to how hard they work and only seem to care about everyone working faster and faster which has led to some people being injured. Also I have heard of instances of a manager provoking workers into a altercation which led to the worker's termination.
good,"Meeting the new person with new ideas and demand to satisfy our view and suggestion  to get approval for their demand.There will be huge amount of red tape and politics to cross over for our development and to holding the customer at our end."
good,"Delivered packages door to door for the drivers on the route. I worked for $8.50 which is a low ball. The experienced drivers would agree. Some of my drivers were cool enough to give us a lunch break, or even buy us lunch at times."
good,"Fun work place, one of the best jobs I ever had. Very flexible, easy going, fun co-workers. Management is easy to get along with. The employee are easy-going"
good,"First I have to go through security via company policy show my id to get into the building."
good,UPS is an intense experience. You never know what to expect.You are under constant criticism but you are in and out as far as a work day. Its is a full days work in 4-5 hours.
good,"Typical day at work is loading a truck with boxes in the correct location,I learned how to properly load a truck,management is pretty structured and organized, hardest part of the job is seasons due to high volume of packages, easiest is after the holiday seasons."
good,"Easy place to work at. Not really much room to grow though. Not enough pay for the amount of work you do. Have to learn about fingerprinting, passport pictures, all sorta of mail, packing, how to pack, delivering mail, laminating, anything dealing with the office (scanning, faxing, printing, ect)"
good,"Very fast pace working environment, short hours and co-workers are fun to be around. I enjoy working at this company and the pay is very good as well as the benefits after working their for a year. I do not like that the breaks between work is very short only 10 minutes and the work environment is very hot which makes it very difficult to keep up with the company's fast pace work environment."
good,"same as other review"
good,I enjoyed working and learning here. I worked with hard working people in all different kinds of weather. This really helped get me through college.
good,"Will learn a lot working for the organization."
good,"To be absolutely clear, I worked at The UPS Store, a privately owned franchise, NOT UPS. For whatever reason, Indeed will not allow me to change anything in that description."
good,I like working at UPS. The team members are very good to work with. I learned a lot about how to lift things and the proper to do lift boxes. I became more familiar to sort items.
good,Great Place To Work and learn a lot about small business tasks as well as packing and shipping all over the USA and other countries.
good,Safety and team work are two main emphases at a work place. Authorities and the team are very helpful and understanding. Among disadvantages are short hours and lower pay.
good,UPS is a production based company.  Performance is closely monitored. I enjoyed being employed by UPS for 27 years but currently looking for a change.
good,The hardest part of my job was sorting out all of the location that was assigned to me to designate to specific location by packages sent to my area.
good,"If you're looking for the kind of job where you punch in, do your job and go home with no strings attached, this is definitely the place. Opportunity for advancement to part-time management positions comes quickly, if desired and you meet the qualifications. Excellent choice for a second job during the holidays!"
good,"management Sucks, but over all get opportunity. wish i can get another job with this company. in a location near me. ful; time"
good,Every day is a bit different which allows for a always changing work. I love how fast paced the environment is it always keeps my thinking of ways to overcome the new challenges.
good,"Started very early in the morning supervising the loaders, making sure they was working safely and quickly. The management was great to work for and most of the co-workers was fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was having to be up so early in the morning. we start at 3AM and i was waking up at 2."
good,"Days were fast paced,learned many new tasks and how to work under timed process,management was no nonsense union,my co- workers kept to themselves most wanted to drive at some point.the hardest part was keeping pace with varied amounts of packages each month and the most satisfying part was getting everything out every day,keeping the trucks washed and ready for the next day"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was each day as a temp worker you were able to pick the brains and ask full time workers for advice on how to do the job better. it was a very inviting place to work from the employee point of view.
good,"I like it, but it is only part time, and no benefits for 1 year. I like it. It is the biggest UPS warehouse in the Nation. The supervisors and managers are always there hands on, to get to know you ."
good,While I enjoyed my day to day job duties and responsibilities I had to be at work 4am Monday- Friday only to work 3.5- 4hrs a day for $11.00 ending with a weekly pay of 100- 150 dollars.
good,Opening the store was always fun and the people i worked for were great employers who loved to satisfy customers and employees
good,"A typical day would be to stay on top of the packages unloaded from the trucks. I would sort packages, audit certain ones that needed shipping corrections to it. Crunch time was very fast paced, so everyone was buys. "
good,Long days as a full time supervisor. Gave me lots of knowledge of the industry. Management over all was good but a few were not. Company Policies were over all good. Co-workers made the job great. lot of comradery and support from peers.
good,I enjoyed working here. You wont do well if your lazy. pay sucks but the work isnt too bad. Work hard and you can work you was up to sup. within a year. great place to make connections.
good,"A typical day at Ups would consist of me loading trucks according to ups standards while keep a steady pace. The hardest part of the job would be pick season, which is when we would receive more boxes than any other time of the year."
good,A typical day at UPS was arriving early and loading my truck for deliveries.  I learned how to be more organize and use a DIAD to complete my tasks on a daily basis. I also learned the 5 seen habits and the 10 point commentary. The hardest part of the job was finding a location not found by the GPS. Overall I enjoyed the driving part!
good,"It is a high pace and innovated environment, where we learn to respect other and get along. We work together as a unit to get the job done well and on time."
good,"Hard work and very tiring. Would make on average over 200 stops per day and was the most productive delivery team, my driver and me, of the delivery squad."
good,"Early morning shift, get job done quickly, with minimal hours. Room to grow as opportunity is presented through seniority at the workplace."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. My coworkers was amazing and very entertaining, giving and pleasant. the drivers was awesome always full of energy and eager to start their delivery routes. The job was easy I started and ended my day with making phone calls to residential and business areas to set up delivery times."
good,"Everyday I had to unload delivery trucks as fast as I could. Its like I was in a gym working out for 5-6 hours. Management talks to u like your a slave. Rushing you to hurry when your're moving the best you can. As said before, every job has lazy people, but not so much at UPS. UPS will actually terminate you for being lazy. Unloading 10 - 15 trucks in 5-6 hours was the hardest part because it had to get done. No Exceptions. The best part of the job of course was the opportunity they had to make more money."
good,friendly employees located by multiple stores. reliable and fast workers that get the job done. the management are friendly nice people.
good,Had learned a lot of different things when it had came to unloading and loading a product.Learned a lot of different zip codes and was trained to the best of my ability.
good,Ups was a real good place to work the work was hard at times but we were appreciated.We were expected to unload/load trailers fast.
good,"Shipping and handling are a small part of the deal with the UPS store. Building relationships to ensure loyalty was extremely important with this job. There are a variety of ways customers could send their mail, but offering the customer something they can't get at the post office or a competitor was essential. I learned a variety of new skills that I had no idea this job would require! Computer knowledge, measurement, analyzing the best and cheapest way to ship things for the customer, being concise with print jobs, and international shipping were some of the many skills I obtained while working here. New challenges were always presented which was always rewarding. I loved working as an individual, but knowing the team was there if you needed any assistance."
good,"Overall, the job is pretty easy. Working out in the elements is probably the most difficult part of the job. It's a decent part time job to have."
good,"I would get to work early and review my route for the day so I can map it out and know what to expect. Any questions i would ask dispatch, my boss, or fellow co workers whom had the route to learn more about my upcoming day. Getting started was the hardest part of the day if I didn't know the area. Once I would get going, with the maps i bought it made the day a lot smoother."
good,A challenging place to work where one could be as creative as possible. Co workers were appreciative and supportive. Membership decline led to the decline of students.
good,"Great Pay, benefits and fun place to work but 3rd shift was difficult for me sometimes, I only worked here for 3 and a half months under a temporary contract."
good,Wish job could be permanent. Always on the go so time moves fast. Interacting with public in an outdoor setting is a plus.
good,well this place is in fact a highly busy place working non stop. there are so many positions and they can switch you to almost any one if they want.
good,"A typical day consisted of packaging, stocking trucks and loading conveyor belts. Seasonal. Some days are busier than others. Lots of work."
good,"It is a great experience in management, and great to learn logistics on the freight side of it. There are great educators and mentors there."
good,Before every shift we have a meeting where management informs their employees how well we did production wise the previous day and how we can improve as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is the very short ten minute break for every shift. It allows my coworkers and I to relax and build good working relationships. The hardest part of the day is are the other five hours and fifty minutes we are working. We are constantly lifting and moving throughout the shift so maintaining a good diet and exercising regularly helps keep my body in shape for the rigors of the job.
good,"I would go in and open the store.  Unlock the  gates, put printers on, log onto the stores website.  "
good,I enjoyed working with different people. I really enjoy helping others understanding what they did not understand in the beginning of the job task. I also like translating words in Spanish for those people who may present a difficult understanding.
good,A typical work day at ups involved sorting boxes and taking orders. co-workers were fun and helpful good team work. Management was respectable.
good,"I enjoyed working here at the UPS Warehouse. Typically the main task would be to move packages from one belt to another, it was definitely a workout. The management was okay but the co workers were the best."
good,"A driver helper position is a good job for starting out, but your experience can vary wildly depending on the driver you are assigned to. "
good,"hard work in a tough environment, but a great way to stay in shape. also challenges the mind juggling addresses constantly"
good,"Fast-paced job that requires physical stamina.  Management can be difficult, but you learn how to let things go in one ear and out the other while still accomplishing the job at hand."
good,"a typical day very fast paced work day non stop movement, life lessons learned in the place management is not so nice very rude vulgar language co workers was great the hardest part of the job was making sure your punching the clock on time most enjoyable part was knowing that the customer was gonna be happy at the end of the day"
good,nothing much to say the workplace is great and pay is deserving. also nice staff and union workers there too thats all ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
good,"It's a college job, not too crazy of a pay even when you get bumped up to management. You get food bonus and a pay bonus when you get into management so that's very nice."
good,This company has really great benefits. Really treats their employees right in that regard although the job is very fast paced.
good,Open opportunity for gain within company. Weekends are available to you. Paid weekly at least $400. Very demanding job.
good,"i liked everything about that job, the people, the environment, the money was cool, nice experience. Everyday, i came to work willing because i knew i was going to like what i was doing."
good,"Operations are evenings to early mornings, hard to get things done during the week.  They do have a ping pong table. Co workers are great."
good,Wasn't too difficult but very long hours and supervisor telling me to work harder and constantly coming in trucks to tell me I wasn't doing a good job.
good,"A good day at work"
good,"been working at UPS for over 3 years"
good,My first job in college! I have so much that I can say about UPS. This job taught me the value of working hard. I was able to meet some good people out there. I miss my old supervisors so much. That was my family
good,"El tipo de trabajo,a manejar importacion y exportacion a conocer diferentes clientes y tipos de productos asi como la relacion con los jefes la cual siempre fue cordial"
good,"Management seems to care about our well being, and also helps us get better at our jobs. As well as training us to be better"
good,Hardest job I've ever had. Made me grow up quick and become a man. The conditions in the hub were very tough. Its always hot. But in all of it made me stronger worker and made me appreciate things in life. It was a great experience for me and i think everyone should go through something like that in life.
good,"i was not there long enough to give a genuine review."
good,Load and unload packages onto UPS trucks for deliver. Became a part time driver and delivered packages. When I was loading trucks the hours were 4:00am to 8:45am. Driving hours were from 9:00am to 7:00pm
good,"Fast pace work environment "
good,"Been here for 5 years and the benefits are amazing. Every day is different, keeps you in shape, but can take a toll on the body if job is not done correctly."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me meeting my driver at a set location to be picked up by the box truck. From there we would deliver packages to their customer's. The job was pretty enjoyable for the most part, i got to meet some very nice customers but the job had a down side as well, dogs."
good,I learned how to packed shoes and shipped shoes. Working with co-workers was great we all worked together. The hardest thing was shipping steal toe boots the whole shift it gets very heavy sometimes.
good,"Major company with lots of potential for growth and career advancement.  Excellent benefits and retirement package.  Only down side for me was not being able to take time off in between Thanksgiving & Christmas due to 'peak season' restrictions.  Being born in December meant not being able to take my birthday either, that was a real bomber. If you are willing to relocate on the management level, there is no real disadvantage to where you can go with this organization."
good,"Somewhat flexible schedule if they like you. Overall, the owner looks out for his employees and likes to make them happy."
good,meet the driver where he says to meet then go to the neighborhood that we have to work and deliver packages to houses and some times have people sign for them
good,"On a typical evening of work at UPS would be getting there 10-15 mins early to stretch before start up. Receiving our safety tips of the day. Wait for the main belts to start up. And get working. Moving from left to right. Lifting packages with a smooth and steady motion at a fast pace. Repeating for the rest of the evening. Lifting and sorting over 1200 packages an hr five nights a week. "
good,Extremely well organized and systematic operation.  UPS breeds a culture of perfection and analyzing all aspects of the job for seamless standardized SOP's.
good,"First job for me in Canada. nothing to say about it, except it was an ok job. normal stuff to do at work, loading and unloading, learnt the job within few weeks. how to scan the barcodes, how to load the trucks, how to do audits and extra,"
good,Lots of opportunities in different areas of the business.  Free insurance and tuition reimbursement but pay is pretty low.
good,Management is often understanding of any situation that may come up.  Pay is competitive and reasonable for positions available and help is always given when asked.
good,My experience at UPS was good because i was hard worker and me and supervisor before i became a supervisor could relate to each other and he inspired me to become a supervisor myself.
good,"On a typical work day at UPS I would clock in, get in a truck with my driver, sort out packages and organize packages and mail. After that we would be on the road and on our routes for the day. My work would consist of me getting in the back of the truck tracking packages and delivering them to the appropriate and correct destinations. Me and my driver would talk about our lives, etc. The hardest part of this job might be to someone else, is being able to lift heavy boxes, 35-70 lbs. And being an assistant you have to move with a good pace of speed to and from your destination. personally, I enjoy the job. I am physically active everyday. And plus you would eventually get use to the job. And that's a typical day working at UPS."

good,"A typical day consists of the following tasks: "
good,"The job is hard if you have no upper body strength. Requires a lot of moving and bending. You only get short breaks (10 minutes) if you part-time because you work less than five hours a day. The people you work with are super nice and make the day go by easier. A lot is expected of you though. But you are trained well. Plus, you get paid weekly, weekends and holidays off, and you have a set schedule always. And they pay for your college education."

good,"The daily work load can be very difficult at times. But I found the relationships formed with customers on the route, and with other drivers, to be very satisfying personally. If you are eager for lots of overtime work then this is the place for you."
good,Working at UPS is quite challenging but it gives you a sense of accomplishment when you're done and review your work.  A typical day at work is sorting packages as they come down the belt.

good,"good benefits, great company, financially stable, and flexability. Friendly co workers. no so friendly management staff"
good,This job was very physical. Loved the employees and I had some really great supervisors. The benefits you receive are substantial.
good,Zustellen und Abholen von Paketen. Dabei ist auf Express Sendungen zu achten da diese Intime zugestellt werden müssen. Arbeitsbeginn ist offiziell um 08:30. Wenn man seine Tour kann und auch eine feste hat ist man um 17:30 fertig. Morgens ist es immer etwas stressiger da man viele Firmen beliefern muss und auch die Express Sendungen an Privathaushalte.

good,"I work part time and I load trailers that can way up to 50lbs or more. "
good,"Das  schöne war das man in verschiedenen Bereichen Erfahrungen sammeln konnte wie schweißen und Sachen in der Mechanik."

good,Work usually starts around 11 a.m. and I would have to meet my driver somewhere along their route. The beginning is really slow due to not being about to find packages but as the day progresses the pace hastens until sundown where is slows down again. Through working with UPS I learned that not everyday has the same rhythm and I would have to adapt to the changes of circumstances to make sure we finished our job in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is the morning where it looks like you will never get through the day.I most enjoyed being able to bond with the driver and having our own fun so that we can make it through the day.
good,Hard Work but good company.  You will not obtain seniority until about 2 years.

good,"The typical work day consisted of waking up at 4 and calling in to see if they needed help that day. If your help was needed you would usually arrive around 5. Once at UPS, I went down to the two trucks I was in charge of loading and waited for packages to come down the conveyor belt. Loading packages seems easy but for some it can be chaotic. The co-workers helped each other out when someone would fall behind which made the job a whole lot easier."
good,Hard work and you get a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.
good,The hardest part of the job was occasionally having to lift a heavy package. The work schedule was very flexible and I was constantly learning new things. The training was very thorough.

good,"A typical day was cleaning theatres and helping customers at the concession stand, nothing really big to talk about. I learned a lot about customer service and helping people and being able to think on my feet. The hardest part of my job is when it got busy and everyone was in a rush.

good,ECM to employees with the plans for the day and get all them started on the daily task. Learned all types of WMS systems. Management was hard to talk to but the co-workers were easy to talk to and was always helpful to each other. The hardest part of the job was working though the sales in the accounts to ensure staffing levels were in line with the volume. The most enjoyable part of this job was when I was training employees on the system to ensure they understand the daily job.
good,"Clearly stated expectations of employees."
good,"good first job, felt under employed, "

The worst day by far was on a rainy day and having a leaky truck to unload. They didn't allow schedule changes for my class that interfered with theres.
good,This job has great advancement opportunities. Honest labor for honest pay.
good,I loaded and sorted the packages being transported to different hubs. I learned to work quickly and efficiently. Management was fair.
good,Great company with opportunity to advance. I would recommend to anyone working through college.
good,"start shift everyday at the same time."
good,"fast paced work, early morning hours, but once you make an impression it pays off"
good,"Good job, good drivers, outside all day, busy and active all day."
good,"Whilw working at UPS store, I would interact with all kinds of customers. I learned how to operate different equipment, packing and shipping techniques, also guidelines.  I happened to be very close to my co-workers, lots of team work was shown while at work. The hardest part of the job,,,, there wasn't any hard part. While the most enjoyable part happened to be holidays, because of the business pickup."
good,Busy 10 to 12 hour days nonstop. Disciplined and dedicated to delivering and picking up packages from all stops daily.
good,"As an Inside Sales Representative with UPS I currently manage a territory with approximately 5,000 accounts that ship nearly $88,000 per day/ $22  million per year. My primary role is to consult new and existing customers on streamlining, process improvements and supply chain optimization. Build relationships with key decision makers and act as a customer's advocate. Researched competitors’ strategies and offerings, and uses product knowledge to generate solutions that meet customer needs and business objectives"
good,"The majority of this job was great, however the pay wasn't worth the stress or the drive to and from work."
good,"I will continue to learn and work harder to get to my Goal."
good,"UPS is a good place to work while you're going to school. The company will pay for your classes. Ups provides benefits for just about everything. Its a fast pace company especially for the outbound loaders. we need to load the and have them delivered by the drivers to other UPS facilities across e country in a timely fashion. It's interesting to see who the people and companies are that ship products out everyday. At the Chelmsford, MA facility, Thursday tend to be the busiest day of the week. I would have to say the best time of year to work at UPS is November to January which we like to refer as peek seaon. This is because of the number of hours you work is high. Normal hours are 20 to 25 hours a week. burin peek its like 30 to 35 hours a week."
good,if you can deal with part time hours for 5 years . This is a good place to work
good,"Good Company, for a student or someone seeking less than full time hours. Great benefits as well."
good,A typical day at work started at 3am with a drive from San Antonio to Kerrville. Most of the time I worked the pre-load shift where we scanned and sorted packages for delivery. I also made address corrections and helped out in the office with customer service duties when needed. Sometimes my day went on to driving a route and delivering packages. I was mostly a cover driver but drove and delivered a lot through our peak seasons. If I worked pre-load only my day ended around 9am. When I drove in addition to working the morning shift my day ended around 6pm. During peak seasons I was prepared to be out on delivery until 10 or 11pm. My job always included lifting heavy packages. My job required working as a team and the most enjoyable part was seeing our customers happy and satisfied with our timely and efficient deliveries. The hardest part of the job was working to resolve any issues with unhappy customers due to packages not arriving on time. Management varied according to the shifts which were typically part-time shifts with different supervisors.
good,I would help the main driver deliver packages. The hardest part was delivering in the harsh weather but I worked itself out
good,"Typical day includes loading/unloading packages in trailers or sorting packages accurately and efficiently to the right belts. You must be part of the union to work there. Therefore, some co-workers can work very slow. The job is not mentally challenging but the job is very physically demanding. On most days, packages come at a very fast pace."
good,"Worked during holiday season, 10 AM to 7 PM were very hard hours but it taught me good discipline. Manager and all of the drivers were very helpful in the training."
good,Learned the entire delivery process from when the trucks are loaded to the end of the shift when everything is delivered.
good,The management there is pretty nice. The job is just too far from where I live at. Everything at UPS is amazing! The hardest part of the job is loading the trucks.
good,"It's a part-time union job.  The benefits are excellent and you are guaranteed a pay raise every year.  It is a very physical job and it is like spending four hours doing circuit training.  Some people take pride in their work and want to get everything done quickly, while others have the ""I work by the hour, not by the item"" mentality that can be found in any union shop.  Doing everything quickly and correctly with a decent attitude will work in your favor."
good,Good pay but long hours. Management is good as long as you do your job.
good,I enjoyed the physical part of this job. It was fast paced and I was part of a team. We worked together toward one goal.
good,Long hours. Days are spent driving back to and from warehouses
good,"Its a great career, although spending a lot of time a way from families."
good,"Hard work for to little pay. Harsh conditions to work in, management is ok. Its super hard to advance to full time, they go strictly on seniority. They make you wait for management positions. Then you have to pay Union dues. The benefits are great though."
good,"A steady changing society which mainly work loads almost never change! Majority of the times we had tons of work to complete in a manner of 3-4 hours. Though work was pretty much the same the enviornment changed from competitve to friendly manuerving if someone needed extra help or training of the position assigned, the staff were almost never to busy to assist a fellow member without slowing there work pace!"
good,"Being a Driver Helper for United Parcel Service was good for me because i met with the driver about 8 times a day for packages to deliver and the rest of the day was doing work by my self. Not a lot of people to deal with, very good exercise as well. Non-stop walking will get you in shape very quick. Made me feel good about my self and my work."
good,Productivity is a must. Dealing with customers is to be expected but the company must be where your interest lies in. Ups provides a great environment and also keeps you informed of the stocks if you are interested in it.
good,"IT rocked, super good experience and I wrote a little bit about it before"
good,"Fast Past, Plenty of Lifting and  Bending"
good,"UPS Security Services has no sick time, vacation time, etc. The company only  has a bonus benefit every year."
good,load/unload and sort packages monday thourgh friday i having nothing more say
good,"Typical day at UPS is pretty straightforward, you come in and punch in, you go to your assigned area and do your assigned work and you punch out when your shift is over.management is there to provide us with any questions or concers we may have about anything work related and are always keeping us on our toes. Teamwork is one of the major qualities taught to us because the only way we can acheive our long tem and short term goals is by usng teamwork. The hardest part of the job is the work iteslf cause it is heavy and non-stop and unrelenting. Your co-workers can be the reason your day goes by smooth and steady, if you have co-workers that are efficient and good to work with that have a good attitude and are good at their job it makes thing easier."
good,Very straight forward job but they do truly care about their employees.
good,"Great place and good environment. Nice, but firm managers."
good,"Great people, great place and learned a lot from this job. Very friendly and uplifting."
good,"Making sure UPS truck's were emptied by a certain time for"
good,"good people , seasonal work , you have to be able to keep up with the driver you are assigned"
good,Great opportunity for learning how to pack and sort by zip codes and states for shipping purposes.
good,"Safety awards   "
good,Good company to work for its always busy and dont get much time to get bored
good,"Shapes you up, you gain more than muscle from working as a loader at UPS. It's an experience."
good,I learned a lot of safety working for ups and a typical day of work includes loading in a fast pace.
good,"A typical day at ups was very interesting. the day started about 2 or 3 pm. seting up 32 work stations making sure all stations had ink, paper and labels. making sure scales were weighed correctly. packages and all other mail was shipped out on time."
good,"working around people that share a lot common interest. The management team I am grateful to have always offer me support in everything I do, inside and outside of work!"
good,"I would start the day by reviewing and finishing all task from previous shift that was left incomplete by myself or co-workers, then conduct a priority check list of work needed to get done. I bring about an energetic attitude to the work environment which helps the co-workers and mangers preform day to day operations with ease."
good,UPS was and actually cool working job with just understanding the way you handle boxes and how everybody was working as a team
good,A very fast paced hard working union job. You have to work your way up.
good,I enjoyed the hands on training to assist customers with their shipping needs. My fellow coworkers were a joy to be around and I appreciated learning to what goes into securely packing and shipping  different products for customers.
good,"During a typical day at UPS, I would be responsible for unloading specially shaped packages and transporting them to their designated delivery trucks. I learned how to self motivate myself to keep moving and stay focused on the job. I didn't really have management telling me what to do everyday because the job was the same thing everyday. When the work day started, my coworker and I would just start working immediately. Unless there was some important information to be known or if assistance was needed somewhere else, my manager would leave us to keep doing our job. The hardest part about being a package handler was the labor work. It was a lot of picking up of boxes of different sizes and weights. The easiest part of the job was determining where each package had to go. For this part, all we had to do was scan the box and a label would print out telling us where it goes. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the various people throughout the warehouse."
good,"This is a great company. The work is very demanding, however, if you work for them, they will work for you. The benefits offered have helped my family."
good,"Friendly colleagues, multi-national team, well organized, tidy. Great place to learn and grow as company tends to promote their current employees."
good,"hours are good, the work is tough and fast but enjoyable, supervisors are both good and bad"
good,Great place to work. Management and co-workers are excellent
good,"I have a passion for employee communications and I am fortunate to have a supportive management team at UPS who is committed to not only seeing me succeed but also seeing my team succeed. They have purchased additional tools (computers, cameras, software) that have allowed for changes to be made in the way we communicate with the over 10,000 UPS Canada employees. We now have the capabilities to be more visual and creative in our communications with graphic design and video production – this is exciting. Because many of our employees are on the road or in an operations setting it is challenging to reach them because they do not sit in front of computers. We encourage face-to-face communications as often as possible but also make sure that visuals like posters and signs are posted in all centres across the country. We have even started producing a newsletter that is intended to be printed and posted so that operations employees feel more connected and engaged. There are positive and negative aspects to working for a company that has such a strong hold on its history and legacy. Change can sometimes be difficult. It does not mean it doesn’t happen, it just might happen as quickly as one would want in this age of instant communication and continuous change. What I love most about my job is that I get to work with all levels of employees from the president to the drivers and all in between. I enjoy making sure that everyone is kept well informed of what is going on with the business and I love sharing the great things that UPS employees do every day in their jobs and outside work"
good,Typically worked 5-6 hours daily. I learned to work with a variety of people. I learned to lead. My co-workers were always there to help and assist in any way. The most challenging aspect of the job was motivating workers who didn't want to work. The most enjoyable part was finally getting through to guys who didn't want to work to see the bigger picture and value teamwork.
good,"I'll have to say this job isn't for everyone."
good,Makes it tough to manage employees that make more money than you
good,Worked there for 5 years. The people and organization are top notch.  The benefits are amazing.
good,"i am in charge of 13 staff and overlook another 20+ drivers"
good,I learned the different sides of what makes UPS function i.e. how to load the Semi truck trailers at night and deliver/pick up packages during the day.
good,"As a helper, would wait for a call from the distribution center, then go to meet a driver in a location that the driver would choose. Work until the days work was done and do it agiain the next day"
good,"Good benefits, workout and get paid at the same time, good group of people to work with."
good,I delivered packages and had scheduled pick ups. It was a very busy schedule and had little time to break or have lunch. I was in great physical shape but it took its toll on my knee.
good,"Loading and unloading of aircraft. Preparing weekly safety meetings, and following up on previous meeting concerns. How to operate a various amount of heavy machinery, and how to lead meetings and following up on issues that were brought up during meetings as well as how to prepare meeting notes and follow up reports. Management was always fare and by the book. The most difficult and most enjoyable part of the job was it was only part time."
good,I like this job the only thing it was seasonal. I love working with other and meeting new people. When i was helping deliver packages to residents and business people treat you with respect and a smile everyday.
good,A typical day working at UPS would be spent in a semi truck trailer loading packages in a very orderly fashion. Packages were to be stacked to fit side to side and bottom to top very neatly so there would be little to no movement with-in the trailer. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work flow as there would be a lot of packages coming down into the trailer at the same time. Co-workers and management were friendly but most of the day was spent in the trailers so there would be very little contact.
good,I really enjoyed working there It was a good place to work and they are all about the employees.
good,"I audit the The UPS Store locations around the United States. They're mostly completed in house, however there are occasions we need to go on-site to conduct the Audit. A typical day at work consists of reviewing and working through Audit packages until they’re ready to be presented to the Franchiee. In addition, I review Royalty Reports for accuracy. I’ve learned how to deal with conflict, improved upon my analytical skills, communication skills – both oral and written - , and time management.  My management team has been great. They’re very supportive and will always have your back. My immediate co-workers are great. There are three other Auditors who work with me, so we’re a tight group that always jumps in to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate Franchisees who feel we’re accusing them of stealing, that we’re nickel and diming them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you’re able to help a Franchisee, teach them something new and help them grow their business."
good,"A place to work hard and to get the feel of, I need to work hard and push my self."
good,Aprendi a ser secretária de direcção. Excelente equipa de trabalho.

good,This job requires one to be in shape and walk up and down hills for a full six to eight hours.
good,"Great outdoors type of Job.  Physically demanding but resulting in great physical shaping."
good,"fast paced, serious and mentally stressful. this job will mold you into a better person but ride is a struggle"
good,"Great place to work, beautiful building and nature trail.  The connections you make will last a lifetime"
good,"The work area is small for a guy my size but the overall work itself is more physically hard than the anything else. Some days are pretty laid back, some others.. well Haha Good luck."
good,A really laid back place to work but no chance for advancement.
good,learned a lot about responsibility and how manage my time at work and my personal life.
good,"A typical day at UPS. Ok so my position was ""Driver Helper"" and basically my primary duty was to ride along with a UPS driver in the truck and assist with deliveries aswell as pickups from both commercial and residential areas. The way it works is that we are assigned to a specific route to work on, so i would meet with my driver on the road most days and begin working right away. The supervisors and managers patroled the routes daily keeping a eye on the workers, making sure everybody was safe and being productive. Everybody was helpful all the drivers respected each other and i can honestly say that i was treated well. My driver was really helpful."
good,good benefits and stability. Micro managed on every level. safety picture is greater than most companies in the industry. Able to learn on the job and they offer several avenues to advance your position
good,Driving was fun and kept me in shape. Supervision was cut throat
good,Very fasted paced environment and physically demanding.  Though most positions are part time the amount of physical exertion makes it feel like its full time.
good,"preloader .self manageable self relient,must learn how to manage time on your own time.Judgement calls should be upon ones knowledge"

good,Makes the days got by quickly. It's nice getting to know all the people along your routes.

good,overall a good workplace. Everyone can improve on somethings
good,Only worked there for 2 months.  Loading trucks for the holiday season.
good,"Good work place, good team, easy to catch on to work requirements "
good,"Many positions available, as well as promotions within. Must be open to changing conditions on a daily basis."
good,"i was a loader/unloader and everyday was the same, load and unload freight to and from trucks. management was ok and co-workers were great to be around.  the hardest part of the job was lifting the hardware on or off the truck.  the most enjoyable part of the job was finally getting finished."
good,"Shipment loading, management, time management, loading procedures, delegating work load, belt supervision"
good,"I loved being the man everyone depended on, in a sense. Seeing the smiles and satisfaction on peoples faces when I brought them their packages made me want to get up and work every day. With it being the holiday season and all, sometimes I felt like Santa Clause."
good,"I typically setup my workstation with prepared seal controls to placed on corresponding area trailers and coordinated my work group to load the planned flow into the trailers."
good,"I was a Full time supervisor, so I was non union.  By bosses take advantage of me being a younger supervisor.  I did majority of all the paperwork, ran the toughest location and was expected to have the greatest outcome.  The operation was only about 4 hours long, but I would work 16-18 hour days on a regular basis."
good,"Loaded UPS trucks by zip code"
good,its a good place to work if your fresh out of high school. not so recommended if you are older. but it is good honest work
good,Was a good job for seasonal i wish it lasted longer i wouldn't mind working there full time.
good,"I would say that the inside of UPS (unloader, pre-loader) positions can be a bit rough at times especially during peak season, and during those times everyone is on edge but I must say there are other opportunities when it comes to things like being a seasonal driver or driver helper.When it comes to management or supervisors they will try to push you to go faster to get the work finished quicker which increases the risk of injury or mistakes basically cramming 8hrs of work in about 3 to 4hrs.Some supervisors can be bit unprofessional at times 'Some"" not all because I personally know some supervisors that care about you as an employee and as an human but if like working out and moving and moving at an fast paste overall UPS is a good company and has the potential to be a great company"
good,"Come into work and work hard while laugh every now and then and nothing end up challenging that I can't handle. People help to explain and train me in new areas. "
good,"excellent company, great coworkers, starting rate isn't bad & there's room for growth"
good,At first going through the interview process you get an idea that the work is manage-able but when you are actually placed in the field its nothing like what you've learned or seen within the first week. Although the work conditions takes a toll on you the work day is short ranging from 5 to 6 hrs a day with a 15 to 20 minute break. Employees like to compete or give one another talks to boost up their spirit during the day to keep work interesting. The whole entire day is bad though but you'll end up getting use to it is what most employees told me.
good,Great company to work for. The company is going in a different direction than when I started. Great co-workers.
good,"Good company to work for, but position is only seasonal. Typical work day is about 10 hours, hardest part of the job is getting in and out of the truck 300 times a day."
good,"mentally and physically demanding, have to be able to plan and execute daily demands on strict time schedule, management demands productivity with out failure,  awesome co-workers with a willingness to help and overcome deadlines, most difficult part of job is managing time effectively, always meeting new customers makes the job satisfying"
good,"UPS is so well known that there isn't much to say here. Few people see beyond the brown trucks though. The inside is a machine of industrial engineering, technical innovation, and willing hands all moving in concert to get packages and inventory from point A to point  Z. "
good,UPS's work culture is great.  Everyone pulls their own weight.
good,I loved fast pace eniv .   Really learned about inside sales.  Gain alot of new customers
good,"Great company, managers however act confused. Benefits were awesome."
good,"Good job for working out.  Also, helped pay for college.  Nice hours and flexible management."
good,"This was a very challenging job. I dispatched to independent drivers in the mountain states.  The worst part was having no drivers available to deliver critical equipment when the weather was bad, snow storms and white outs."
good,"Well, a typical work day for UPS started around one am in the morning long after the sun had been down and the stars burned bright and I would sleep all day just to get into the right set of mind for the long, laborious hours that awaited me. I would drive there, park my car, walk to the factory in between the yellow walk path and you must walk on that yellow walk path otherwise you'll get fired or run over by a eighteen-wheeling semi-truck containing loads and loads of boxes which make the truck weigh even more to make it that much easier to turn your bones into dust when you got squished. Thank God no one got squished when I worked there, but I've heard stories. Then I would walk into the factory and the fun began. Noise. Loud noise, everywhere. Beeping noises. Gaunt, grunting, breaded, red-eyed figures talking about last night's football game, who won, who lost money. Just union workers standing around drinking a cup o' joe waiting for the typical (and always you must go) health meetings before the work day started."
good,"I spent my days creating load plans for the entire GA district.  This involved creating, reviewing, and executing load plans daily with the operation. I worked 12 to 14 hours a day."

good,Working with Driver during peak season.  It is a physically demanding position.  Have to get on and off the truck two hundred times a day.  They have a culture of safety.  It is rewarding to bring customers their packages.
good,"A typical day involved processing packages for customers, organizing and dispersing mail for the mailbox holders, occasionally doing fingerprints for Daon, an electronic fingerprinting company. Along with this I would close the store, balance the registers and process the Daily cash report for the End of the day reports."
good,"Being a driver helper with UPS was the best job I ever had, hands down. Great hours, 40 plus a week, raking in a good chunk of change, ranging from 450 to 500 a week..the job was fast paced, pushed you to be perfect no matter the situation and management was efficient. Beneficial, profitable, and competitive, I couldn't ask for more."
good,"Team oriented company, work together for a common goal. Hard work, but not very much thinking involved."
good,Quick paced enviroment and sorting boxes. Employees help with your trailer.
good,I really did not like it. The managers seemed very biased and didnt care about their outside cart workers

good,"I enjoy working on and beside the aircraft, all while still maintaining a safe environment."
good,"Receiving, sorting, and shipping mail"
good,there are no typical days here everyday is different in the warehouse. the hardest thing about this position is keeping up with the amount of packages you should unload /load when you first start

good,Great company to work for. Great group of people and managers.
good,"A typical day at the UPS Store consist of fulfilling customers needs, such as faxing, packing, shipping and making copies. While working at this location I learned that addressing each situation with a positive attitude, shows the customer confidence in your services. Management included one individual whom was just opening his first franchise, an with my prior years of experience at a different location I was able to assist unfamiliar areas of the business. There were three additional co-workers, not including myself and we all got along for the most part without any issues. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what type of mood the next customer will have upon entering the store. Most enjoyable part of the job was accommodating customers needs we were able to insure delivery."
good,Work with a great group of drivers. Customers are nice and understanding of the demands of the job.

good,I enjoy working at company.  Love 10 to 12 hours shifts with the company.
good,Working for UPS gave me a first hand experience with our mail system. 
good,Early shifts that required teamwork and strength. Timely fashion with my driver on all aspects. Weather played a factor but we were prepared. Scanning boxes and tackling task over delivering over 200 packages daily.
good,"Working for the UPS was a very exhausting job. There was never a dull moment during our night shift. Loading 10 to 15 semi trailers in just a couple hours means a lot of hard work. Even though the work was hard, the people I worked with were a lot of fun making the job easy to handle. "
good,Half to be dedicated person to work there on time ready to work
good,"There was nothing difficult about the work done at UPS. It was pretty striaght foward, deliver parcels with out harming your self and collect some signatures with a d.i.a.d. I learned just how stressful it can be when drivers have to pick up the slack for other driver when they call out or get hurt on the job, one driver has to learn anothers route and that makes the work day longer. The hardest thing about the job was finding a good hiding spot on a customers property for an large parcel so that it wouldn't be so obvious for random people walking down the street to steal. I enjoyed working with my driver, he was pretty cool and funny."
good,"For being just a volunteer, it was a tough but enjoyable job, learned how to manage object and work with flow."
good,loved the job but it was temp. so didn't last longer than 8 months
good,"I would walk in the warehouse and get all my equipment ready for work. Then, I would go and prepare my trailers ready to load in. I would then begin to load my assigned trailers and help others when possible until the night was over. I learned how to build a tight and secure wall inside of a trailer. The managers were good leaders and helped everyone push through the day. My co-workers were hard workers and were always nice. The hardest part of the job was the heat inside of the trailers some of the days. The most enjoyable part of the job was always keeping busy and not worried about the time."
good,"Physical work, not managed well, management only cares that the job is done on time and correctly. Need more employees or they need to slow the flow of the belts down, especially the sorting belt. Most enjoyable part of the job...the 10 min. break you get. Oh and no a/c or heating."
good,This was a great company but i have a passion for working in the medical field.
good,I really dont like it but its ok. must of the people there are nice and fun to work with. Its alot of hard work and anybody can do it
good,"very demanding job both physically and mentally. best co-workers   "
good,It was a good job I really liked working at ups. My co-workers were also good workers so we got everything done on time

I enjoyed the diversity and the training."
good,Good economic and financial analysis experience.  Solid internship opportunity for b-school.

good,Like any place there are some good points and some work that company can work on with employee relations. 
good,Fast paced and full of variety. Working for UPS allowed for interaction with a variety of people and ability to enhance customer service skills. Computer skills were an asset as well as being able to multi-task and switch between unrelated tasks as needed. Adaptability is a must for working for UPS.
good,A typical day required you to be physically ready speed and strength are key factors in this job. Management and co-workers are good respectful people
good,"It was an ok job, great way to stay fit.  You should only work as a truck loader if your strong mentally. Loading trucks can sometimes  become frustrating during peek season, and there's lots of packages coming down. You may come to a point where your at the top of the truck and are only getting heavy boxes, this requires you to put the boxes aside until some light ones come along and you are able to fill the top space. This results in your truck being unclean, so you have to move all the heavy boxes you've set aside to the correct position in order to start a new wall, this can become highly frustrating if you don't have a strong mind set. Plus the flow doesn't stop so you still have to manage the boxes coming down, while trying to clean your sides The job requires speed and efficiency. "
good,"For Me.. UPS has Been A life Changing Experience.. I have grown from a young man knowing nothing about the company.. Outside of the brown trucks, (Which are called Package cars, Which dock in the Metro section of the Hub)To A Slightly older young man who can Work a Scanner, Set-up A workload, Pull trailers, Sort & Load packages.. I Personally appreciate My Management team & Co-workers.. We all come together & communicate in order to get the Job Done. All in all I would say Its a great experience.. & I mostly enjoy my crew..  If I had to choose a part of the day that is challenging it would probably be, being short staffed.. "

good,"long days hard work"
good,"I learned a great deal about business from working there.  Learned about marketing, logistics, sales, customer service, graphic design.  A typical day there ran the spectrum of all of those things.  Wonderfully varied. "
good,"As a Package Handler, I enjoyed my time with UPS. Although my primary responsibility was to unload trucks, I still became well-acquainted with most of the employees on my shift. "
good,Get to work at 8:15 to organize my truck so I would be ready to go at 9:00am to make sure early airs are delivered before 10:30am then continue with the rest of  my deliveries then after 5:00 pick up time will not be done till 8:00pm. To  have the best customer service I could  possibly have is what I learned. Some of the management was the best and some not so good. Very good co-workers team like atmosphere.

good,"You find, as in any job, a new family but you CAN also find close enemies if your looking for them or not. Work is as expected, repeditive but manageable. You may be asked to work longer hours but most of the time it comes with warning especially if you have worked during the busy seasons with UPS. "
good,This is where I got my first chance to learn about management.
good,Flexible hours. Decent pay for someone who is looking for a first job. Work is easy.

good,"Very organized workplace. I learned to be reliable, cooperate with my team. Management keep you updated about what was happening around you. Co-workers were very friendly people. The hardest part of the job was about timing everything you do. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the customers you serve in a daily basis."
good,Typical day is handling mail and packaging and shipping customers mail. Owner isn't the best. Management is good though. Nothing hard.
good,i would get a call from ups telling me where and when i needed to be to be picked up by the driver. i would meet the driver and they would take me around on their route and i would deliver packages while they drove and sorted through the packages in the back. it got very cold in the trucks at night even when wearing the very thick jacket during the day it would usually be very warm but the jacket is an absolute requirement for the job. best part about the job was the constant change in scenery. the hardest part was the cold.
good,"Very fast paced work environment. I enjoyed being out on my own for deliveries. Excellent pay and benefits. Great training program. All co-workers and managers were the hardest working I have seen an any work environment I have ever been around, it was a breath of fresh air."
good,Great place to work with fun co-workers and informative managers.
good,I would take assigned trailers to the designated area that was made by my dispatcher

good,"My responsibilities at The UPS Store included, but were not limited to: opening and closing the store, packing and shipping customer boxes, designing business cards/invitations/flyers/etc, binding, laminating, printing services, taking inventory, and balancing cash drawers. Throughout my time there, I have learned how to communicate effectively with all customer types and the importance of this skill. I am also capable of teaching new workers how to be more efficient without losing quality in their work. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of this job is designing a document or editing a picture that pleases the customer."
good,"een dag ziet er nooit hetzelfde uit. soms heb je veel te doen, soms weinig. bij een drukke dag zijn er veel stressmomenten, maar omdat het werk leuk is kom je de dag prima door."
good,"We delivered packages, and I also got to meet a lot of friendly people"
good,this was a great job
good,-A typical day would be hard cause the boxes were heavy
good,opened and closed the store i was the only worker all day the day starts out with opening the store getting the cash register ready and the pos system up to proses the packages.

good,Days at UPS were ordinary and peaceful.. i learned how to control my body during heavy lifting
good,"I am a sorter, a person who sorts incoming boxes throughout the factory according to the zip code on the box to be delivered. It is actually amazing, for I have dealt with boxes not only from the United States, but also from around the world. France, Brazil, Africa, and Great Britain are just a few of the places the boxes can be from. I also get a great work out at this job. I rarely have to worry about setting up an exercise plan because this job is that active. Walking the belts is pretty cool. Looking for boxes and breaking jams is almost like trying to solve a puzzle. Also, my coworkers are pretty awesome to work with."
good,Corporate style Management practices.. Strong Union for hourly employees which makes for a frustrating managment challenge.
good,"Overall is a good staff to work with. General manager has a high knowledge about the tasks. Rest of staff is very good at job, has one quality that makes each of us special. Owner can come off wrong at times but really tries."
good,"I really honed my skills here, learned to prioritize, organize, and become an effective project manager."
good,"Night sort typically began each night with a meeting where the previous day's numbers were discussed and the expectations for the night. Supervisors are responsible daily for the set up and wrap up of trailers and belts, work areas, employee attendance and performance, and necessary paperwork. Here I learned invaluable management skills through training and interacting daily with many different departments and co-workers. I would say the hardest part of the job was adapting to the ever changing whims of my supervisor while keeping my employees motivated each day. This of course was the most enjoyable part because I had the opportunity to work generally with the same people every day and build relationships, all while breaking a sweat ensuring customers would get their packages."

good,"It is a nice place to work at, that is very team oriented because if the team fail we all fail."
good,"a typical day at ups consisted of 5-7 hours of loading trailers lifting, bulk boxes up to the other trailers, or running metro carts with a 15min break between. a lot of what I learned at ups was team work if your building a wall of boxes with another person your going to have to work together to get it done or you or that other person could get injured or you just have poor quality wall because your not working together"
good,-Whole work day included unloading UPS packages from tractor trailers onto a conveyer belt.
good,Working with UPS was an experience that was fast paced and it taught me the importance of accuracy. I enjoyed being a part of a team of very little mistakes. I learned to quickly recognize and correct mistakes that were made by myself or another member of the UPS team.
good,Hard Work and slight hours at $9 if you are loading trucks. The Tshirts they give as incentive are nice but can be done without. A Typical day at work is 5 hours (1 hr overtime). Management is strict and meticulous. Co-Workers try their best to assist with work load when possible. Hardest part of the job is the hours and the rediculous amount of boxes.

I've learned a lot about the transportation world in this position, and I gained some good experience with working with all types of people. Oracle was a program that I learned how to use in this position. Nothing comes to mind when I think of the ""hardest"" part of the job, I just think that sometimes in this position it can be fast-paced and deadlines have to be met, so keeping cool under the pressure is very important to maintain. The most enjoyable part of this position for me is working with positive people and I enjoy working with numbers."

good,A typical day at work was being a caddy and assist golfers with their needs while they played. I enjoyed my job when I knew I was assisting professional players. My co-workers enjoyed this job as much as I did. The down part of this job was that our only busy season was the summer and spring.
good,Days were always started early morning.
good,It was alwAys very buy helping customers with All their complaints And problems. Working As A team very important to getting All shipment out on time. Dealing with AIrlines and drivers was A daily duty for rates and routing flights.
good,"My experience with UPS was one that was to be expected. I consider this to be a good thing as there are no surprises beyond a given job description. When hired, it is outlined exactly what the job functions were and there is very little deviation from those functions. The HR staff was very friendly and the full time drivers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would have to be the constant exiting and entering of the UPS vans. People who are more out of shape than others will find this very tiresome and taxing. Overall, I learned just how much more busier the holiday season gets for businesses such as UPS."
good,i have worked for U.P.S for 13 years and have learned logistics management and to supervise multiple people and to muliti task.

Here i have learned how to manage different types of work tasks such as under time sensitivity and pressured situations. Management here is awesome, they are open minded to options and different types of opinions to how to work quicker, safer, and with a professional finish on all tasks. One of the best parts about working here is working with co-workers, they are always there with a positive attitude and will do almost anything to get the job done correctly. The hardest part about this job is the multi taking. In other words either you have what it takes or just simply your not cut out for meeting challenges."
good,"The store is a good place for college students or the part-time employee. Hours are flexible and pay is relatively good, but no benefits or any ability to truly move up."

good,Good place to work. Always busy. Friendly people. Nice environment.
good,"Overall, UPS is a strong company to work for. The schedule is excellent and the pay is reasonable, the benefits are very good. However, the Inside Sales role is shifting incrementally to a more classic sales position, which is less to my preference & skill set. The goals & metrics adjust more often than is helpful, and it's often difficult to discern how daily efforts impact the 'commision' portion of the compensation."
good,the daily work was always the same. the environment was cold and often a lot quieter than a warehouse with forklifts all around you. very hands on work..
good,have to be able to work fast to be done early. in and out the truck does take a toll after a wile.
good,this was a seasonal job and i would work for them again and could work there fulltime
good,Time was of the essence at this job. Accuracy of delivery address even more so. Over the phone directions from customers would always be interesting in remote areas of the cape.
good,"I like working for UPS. When I get to work, I like feeling the challenge of how fast I can safely load packages in an orderly fashion on the shelves of the delivery car. I have five delivery cars to load and they all have different areas and streets, which is a bit more challenging than my co-workers, considering most of them have only three. Mainly, what I have learned is the almost all of the streets and places of the city. The most enjoyable part of my job, is the actual loading. I like to make a tight ""wall"" of boxes with the packages, so they won't fall from the shelves, and get mixed up, then give the delivery driver a hard time. I also liked being a Driver Helper. Accompanying the driver to various locations, and having that experience of handing expected merchandise to people. What I dislike about my job, is that employees progess by seniority.You start off as part time employee with 3 1/2 hours. It takes as much as 10 years (depending on location) to become a full time employee. It does not matter if you work harder than any other employee, you will not see progess until a few years pass."
good,i enjoy a physical job.i have been with ups for twenty two years.
good,UPS is a great place to work. The workers are extremely hard-working individuals. The atmosphere in the workplace is always positive. We always strive to do the best work that we can and also make things flow more smoothly and efficiently.
good,"Was a great experience, as-well-as the training and honestly of the Trainers."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you dont mind waking up before dawn and working 8 hrs. in 4. Great for someone just starting out, graduating high school."
good,A great place to work if you need some extra cash. The benefits were great but the pay had little to be desired.
good,Good job if you need a job with benefits. i started making 11 an hr after the 1st few months the only thing was it wasn't that many hours
good,"It is really fast paced, but, if fortunate, long hours and money for a short amount of time (if working temporary) is worth it."
good,"great people to work with, hours ok, pay ok, only had seasonal job"
good,I loved working for UPS. It has opened many doors for me and helped me gain an education to further my career.
good,"It is a very fast paced job, dealing with customers all day in person and on the phone, It is a very challanging job"
good,"In this job, I learned a lot about helping deliver and process packages. Overall, this was a good opportunity for me."
good,"UPS was a great employer, which offered plenty of over time or should i say made you work overtime due to understaffing. I did not mind the over and double time but it was a constant every day thing that deprived us mechanics of our out side lives to make and attend personal apponoiments and spend time with familly and to cordinate with wife for her shift of work and to find help for the kids if no parent was going to be arround."
good,Worked with alot of different people in my brief time working for U.P.S. and enjoyed everyday learning something new about those people and the job they do everyday.
good,The work was very hard and i learned alot about packing and loading trucks it was my first job out of high school it prepared me for the work force and now i am ready to engage in the work force
good,"You have to constantly triple check your hours to ensure you are paid properly. Second, the hours vary way too often, as well as start times. There is also no definite end of shift time."
good,"Theses stores are owned by people , not companies. It’s pretty relaxed. This is a great job if you like working with packing and meeting new people. You also deal with putting mail in the lock boxes."
good,"Seasonal worker, and I was able to get time off as needed. The work was too physical for me because it does require a lot. I enjoyed working with the customers for the most part although some you could never make happy 🤪!"
good,Working at UPS was a great opportunity to interact with a numerous amount of people each day. Working in the fast pace environment of the work truck was interesting as well.
good,"Fast paced work environment, can be a fun place to work. They will train you to operate forklifts, reach trucks etc. However there was a very high turnover rate while I was there due to the long hours/ mandatory overtime we had to put in."
good,I enjoyed working at UPS. The hours were convenient considering the fact that I had a second job. It was nice to lose some weight while working their. Don’t apply if you bother with or have issues with your legs/knees.
good,"Getting routing order and "
good,Nice work environment. The definitely keep you occupied with work. The staff is nice. It's not a issue with the checks if so the correct it for you. Its a fast paced environment. The coworkers are helpful as well in finishing up job
good,"Very fast paced when out on the road delivering packages. You delover packages until you get done,  no matter how long it takes.  The drivers I worked with are hard working and earn everything they make.  The drivers and management were friendly."
good,i liked working here is good job if you are a night person/early morning person. the one thing i did not like the best was that the start an finish times are different every day.
good,Very fast pace must be able to multi task. Fairly flexible with time. Pay is not competitive but very good experience. I would say great starting point to gain the knowledge to start a career in logistics.
good,Its a pretty fun job I just hoped it would of last long if only it wasn't a season peak or part time for me. The salary was great but there wasn't enough hours for me.
good,Make sure you get all the phone numbers you can for your supervisors. You need to text them to get the work schedule if you don't you may looses the job.
good,"This job was very challenging and fast pace, but it was also very strict. Their was times were it was fun working here but it demanded of a lot of physical."
good,"Over my 20 years experience with UPS, its been, at most, a satisfying  period. The friendly, teamwork environment, family-friendly and flexible time provided is worth noting. The overall paid package, including its pension is comparable."
good,I really love my job the older supervisors are easy to work with but the younger ones really have power trips and let their positions go to their heads..
good,It’s pretty unorganized you get laid off whenever they need workers from other areas to come into the building so that’s really tough. The workloads are a bit excessive as well. If you don’t mind getting up at different times of the night then I say work here it isn’t that bad it can just become tedious.
good,This job is good for keeping you in shape and with decent pay. I’d recommend it for college / post high school students in need of a good job. Was a season hire.
good,Good if your looking for holiday work or peak season hours will need a second job or may need to find other employment altogether after peak season is over
good,I like working in a fast paste enviroment because it keeps me energized and people also benefit of physical strength and losing weight overall its a physical job that requires good strength and the ability to work for a lot of hours non stop
good,"La empresa es buena, politicas y reglas bien definidas"
good,If you're looking for a second job preload for UPS would be a good place to start to eventually possibly become a driver which is a lot of hard work but they get good pay and good medical benefits
good,This is an intensive job. You must come in each day energized for the labor ahead. There will be times of little to no work along with brutal periods of heavy package flow.
good,This Provider only gave out 25 hours a week and was only seasonal. It was not a stable position. They rarely have those available. They need to offer more partime and full time positions.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal driver assistant, I had worked as this the prior year as well and I could see a lot less business this year for UPS due to Amazon building its own delivery fleet. UPS is a good company to work for, fair and flexible as allowable, but the hours for us workers were far less than was promised at hiring. "
good,UPS is a good company to work for. Very fast paced. I was a seasonal driver helper but I liked it as a job. Good extra money for the holiday season. I’d recommend working for UPS.
good,"Position was seasonal.  Hours were not consistent but days were Monday - Saturday before holiday.  After holiday, work was scarce then position ended."
good,"I liked the job and i worked for a fair amount of money, but the only thing about it that was troubling was that it communication needed to be more clear between HR, the driver, and myself."
good,UPS was good a good place work for a first time warehouse job. Only bad thing about it is the intense summer heat and the freezing cold. There are also no full time portal positions which I don’t get
good,"It's boldly made it seem in the recruiting and training, be a seasonal helper now get full time/management later, but there is nothing for me after the season ends. Asking my manager only neted me a brief ""look if we have something."" No ""seeing as you are already with us, let's see what we can do"" Which is disappointing. (thus far) "
good,"Work at fast pace , heavy lifting, multi tasking , and working with others. Stacking boxes in orderly fashion keeping your area clean. There is always something to do never sit around."
good,Its probably the easiest job I've had. Walk boxes from truck to door and back. Beyond that there's some organizing here and there but it's very easy if you're physically capable.
good,"Nice environment, friendly coworkers, it was a franchise so no chance of growth.you have to be able to uplift big boxes and to learn the system. it was nice."
good,Part time unload was the best to be at if you  can lift stuff 75+ pounds but for females or something they got a bag belt that was the easiest but don’t pass time well
good,All the drivers I’ve had have been professional and great people.   It’s getting me in shape for the army and it’s fun to meet different people.     It’s a $19 an hour job without any XP required...yes you are going to get a workout...snowflakes...  Terrible management and communication with scheduling...I once called a dispatcher out for terrible communication and they withheld work from me for a week....
good,It was a really fast-paced job that needs one that is really physically and mentally alert. I think that the hard part of the job for me was the issue of hopping in and out of the delivery truck in the snow-filled side-walks.
good,"I scanned the boxes so people can track there packages, than I stack them in a trailer after I scan each one. The job was kinda easy it’s just my transportation at the time"
good,"If your aiming at being a driver or in-house supervisor or management then it's worth the struggle to endure. Doing preload especially during peak season is hard. You work 9+ hours 6 days a week. Your constantly moving, lifting heavy/light packages for hours at a time."
good,It was cool a lot of lifting and bending but long as you stay busy go by fast I enjoyed working there was only seasonal work for me might try to go back
good,"Productive Working space where i learned UPS Delivery service en route , devices used by drivers for UPS , the hardest part of the job was also the environment , hard weathers"
good,typically you would show up clock in and start working after the meeting. I learned how to pick items in a warehouse. management various but usually its pretty good. the hardest part of the job is not getting distracted.
good,Working there during the holidays was pretty hectic but overall fun delivering peoples orders during the holiday season . You go door to door in the heat so thata a downside
good,"UPS offers both a sense of stability, yet offers different challenges everyday, which prevents complacency. I obtained focus, alertness, and responsibility from this company."
good,The people at ups don't care about you as a person and just want you there too get the job done its very hot and people don't care if you pass out they pay good but its not worth what actually happens at ups
good,"everyday is different, having to solve new challenges everyday can be exciting yet also stressful. November and December are by far the busiest months you will have."
good,Was an experience that I enjoyed. Had great people working with me and that added to my being able to do my work well. They were also very patient with teaching me how to use the DIADS
good,"deceptive tatics to end contract and unwilly to talk face to face which is kind of cowardly, may be some of the management inexperience. I will say that their lack of experience will lead to their downfall."
good,"I had a good experience working in recovery! Besides the pay, you do get benifits, so it wasnt terrible. I liked working there! I enjoyed the work I was doing! It was really fast pace and you did have to ne a quick learner!"
good,"One of the best things about UPS is you have a chance to move around and do different jobs within the company. "
good,I am only a seasonal driver and have not been offered any chance at advancement.  Enjoy working for them on a seasonal basis but am actively seeing full time work.
good,"I like the job ,but have not gotten many hours .I have been waiting for them to determine whether they can inspect a second vehicle because my first one had an issue."
good,"Starting out is a little tough due to the sheer amount of different responsibilities you take on, but after getting the hang of it the job becomes fairly fun."
good,A typical work day consists a 4-5 clerk shift and usually 2-3 hours of shuttle or various other activities during the day. There is a fair amount of labor involved in a typical work day at UPS regardless of position
good,"This was my first experience with driving forklifts and machines, It was a great place to learn the basics of working in a large warehouse.  They started everyone out as a temp, then you had to apply to get a full time status which makes sense.  The temp work is basically the interview for a permanent job.  Some of the managers have a no none sense approach, others are way more laid back.  "
good,If you are looking to work a seasonal job this is a great one. They offer training and you work assisting a driver delivering packages.  It is not easy work but it is fast passed and the day goes by fast.
good,Fast paced and goal oriented. Great place to start a career.
good,"Fun job if u like to work out, must work hard and fast because shipments are always coming in, Warehouse workers needed and always looking for new managers"
good,"I was a high school student willing to work from the hours of 4-10. It was worth it, but it takes a toll on your body after a while. UPS was a great starter job."
good,This was a great job that entailed working alongside a UPS driver to assist in the timely and accurate delivery of packages. The job was extremely fast-paced.
good,Just got hired have not started working just yet looking foward to working with the company.Im a very hard worker I think I will love working for ups.
good,"I have no comment to list under this section, its overall a ok job. Pay rate is good hours are not. I guess because it's just seasonal hopefully will work up to more hours there."
good,"Good pay and benefits with advancement opportunities. Inconsistent HR and management. Not for the thin skinned or faint of heart as you will be pushed to your limit.Good compensation but some other companies have passed them by, Some very good co-workers, some not.Your life is not your own during peak season months of November and December, crazy work hours demanded."
good,Agréable sérieux bien payer entreprise bien gérée.
good,Needs better equipment and they way staff communicate is poor Bt the benefits are were it’s at and the people are nice and if u want career it’s perfect
good,"arbeit in der nachtschicht"
good,When i started at UPS it was fairly simple as i was told. i would arrive on time wait for the trucks to arrive then get to work start unloading and what was to heavy we would use a pallet jack that way we dint hurt ourselves. after that we would load trucks that were heading out.
good,"In my time there, the experience was stressful, fast-paced, and hostile. It was a brash place with a rough assortment of people and on several occasions, my items have been stolen despite my locker being properly locked."
good,Great training and community involvement programs. Long time employer with a strong culture. Strong brand that is recognizable and provides credibility in the work community.
good,I think preloader is a great part time job. Given the overnight schedule it pays above minimum wage. It also allows one to pursue other opportunities during normal business hours. Once trained you are given minimal oversight as long as one is efficient.
good,"Working at ups was ok, it was like I was getting paid to workout and stay fit. There is money to be made during peak seasons When you can do overtime."
good,Ups is overrated. What they pay you feels like minimum wage for the work you do. The managers and supervisors seem clueless they don’t know what their doing.
good,Like working there its ok got to move kinda fast bur you will get the hang of it.....supervisor need to b more comer need more help in different areas but overall good job to work
good,A very Good job. but stressful work conditions and a waiting list for full-time. but besides that excellent benefits. union job and very good job security.
good,"Nice place to work, close to home. Didnt llike that in the winter time didnt have no heat. I love working there the time went by really quick in the mornings."
good,UPS was a good job..when speaking in terms for job Sercuity and structure...but this JOB was one that would display some of the Bad Stigmas that go wit WAREHOUSE work.
good,They work you very hard fair but hard. No easy jobs at this company. It is a great career if you have no children and dont mind working long hours and weird schedules.
good,If you can't keep up don't bother to work there make sure you wear the proper Footwear and move very fast pace it can be exhausting sometimes depending on where you are working
good,"Fun to work with the other employees "
good,"Usually I woke up early as 2 am since my shifts were mostly from 4 am - 7 am. Most of the time though during rush hours or holidays we would be there overtime trying to get everything out delivered on time. Some days were pretty nice and smooth and some days would be rough, just like any other type of work. As a package handler, you're more in the factory than out delivering so you don't need to interact with other people other than your coworkers. I had a nice time there since it was my first job, but being safe is probably the most dangerous thing about the job since you work around machines that deliver package from one end to another as well as vehicles driving around often. The hardest part about the job is just lifting things above your head to get packages to fit."
good,"As long as you're in the union it's a good place to work. Management is cut throat so If you want to go into management DONT, once you cross the line into management you can never go back into a union position."
good,"If you are in good physical condition and know how to maintain good health, UPS is a fun place to work with many interesting people to work with. There are no weekend shifts."
good,"Great place to work and a team environment. Methods are set and followed but  excessive stress is beginning to hamper the EOD process. Unfortunately tech is severely outdated and causes issues ."
good,"Good job as a second job or someone in school. "
good,"It’s alright to work at ups if u just now starting to work "
good,Always fun to meet new and help people. They offered flexible hours and accommodated students. Holidays were a bit hectic and busy but the bonus incentives were worth it.
good,I’m hardworking outgoing and reliable on my job. I show up n do everything I’m supposed to do if already knowing about it or trained on it either way I’m working cause I gots to make a living .
good,"Budgeting, Finance, and P&L Responsibility"
good,As long as someone isn't afraid to work hard the job was pretty easy. You have to hurry sometimes to get the work done but that was what made the day go by fast
good,I love the company plus benefits are great just can’t deal with the hours any more having a family As a driver your work day begins at about 8 am and ends at about 9 pm if your lucky. The money is great so are the benefits but it’s a very hard place to work
good,The hardest part of the job is not feeling overwhelmed as a package handler. It can be intimidating when there are packages piled up everywhere but just do the best you can. As a management person its always best to look at the positive side of thigs and build a relationship with each one of your employees. If they don't feel like they can trust you the job will be a little more challenging.
good,"A very team oriented workplace with projects to do everyday. Flexible schedule, good hours, and great staff. Hardest part of the job is customer claims. Most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction."
good,Opportunities within UPS are endless. I have learned a lot about the working culture and the desired output from an employee. Monotonous and repetitive work is the hardest part of my job. I have some great colleagues to work with which make your day worthwhile.
good,"Great place to work if you have an open mind and a positive attitude, well better then most people ppl who work there.  Big routes, long hours, no life,  great pay and bennies.  Management isunorganized,  Somewhat scatterbrained and all over the place.  Great people but just to much on their plates.  When you need to take to them it's all good if they are right there next to you but good luck getting a return call"
good,"For a seasonal position this was a great place to work to pick up some extra cash during the holidays. Very busy but also organized, time goes by fast because it is fast paced work sorting and loading packages."
good,Hours were cut tremendously its no kind of teamwork communication just doing what u can to make it thru the day ...employees miss alot of days without any disciplinary actions
good,"we would clock in then go to our stations. Then I would start scanning packages that would come down the belt from the trucks, work about 2hrs then a 15min break then back to scanning once trucks were done we would scan air packages that one of our drivers would bring back from the air port. All in time for the trucks to leave at 9am. If the air was late some of us would stay behind and get them scanned in then we would go and meet the drivers on there route. It is normaly very hot in the wharehouse and the fans help if your lucky to be infront of it. It is a very fasted pasted job and you will need tobe able to left min. of 60 lbs. and able to withstand the heat or cold when its winter."
good,Delivery drivers are what makes UPS successful.  It is extremely hard work but rewarding.  Very numbers driven and the supervisors enjoy riding you hard.
good,Working at UPS was a good experience as it was my first job ever. It taught me that working is not easy and can be very tiring. I learned how to use certain equipment and how to operate some machinery. The hardest part of the job was doing the same type of physical work day after day. It's very hard on the body so I don't recommend doing package handling for too long.
good,"Great job for college students looking for extra money and tuition assistance. Management can be a bit rough, but as long as you work hard they will not harp on you. Benefits as a part timer are the best."
good,This is a great part time job for someone who is in college and can't work full time or needs really good benefits. There are 2 different  shifts 3-9am or 5-10pm
good,"hard work, long hard hours during the holidays . as a new worker for the company hours various due to probation and seniority hours were given the maximum hours"
good,The hardest part of the job is that you have to move fast and play a bit of tetris with the boxes when placing them in the truck. Need a bit of muscle to lift heavy boxes.
good,I dint like how certain shifts in the afternoon were handled.I believe they were disorganized and very careless. I had no training and night shift was careless.
good,UPS is a great opportunity for relocation.  They have a loose work schedule so the flexibility is great.  The hardest part of the job is to reach/exceed their goals for their bonus program.  It makes it really hard to live off of the job.
good,Decent place to work.  It was fast paced but noy unrealistic. Hours and pay were the only draw back to working here.  Location was another. For a college student or retired person it would be a decent job.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced. I learned to work with the team and pick up the tricks of the job quickly. Management worked well with employees. Workplace culture was fine. The hardest part of the job was just keeping up with the pace, but it wasn't terrible. The most enjoyable part of this job was the experience."
good,You stand at a conveyer belt and load 3 trucks at the same time when the package would come down the line. There is no time to stop and think just do. At certain points you have to balance all 3 and lift very heavy items onto the conveyer and then into your truck. Being well built is almost a requirement.
good,"Load trailers by scanning every package that comes off the roller to assure zip code is correct. Stack boxes heaviest to lightest building a durable wall for transportation. Unload trucks constantly picking boxes up and placing them on a conveyor system, while repairing damaged boxes, as well as pulling any marked hazardous. The hardest and most enjoyable part of this jobs was figuring out how to move E -rigs, or items/boxes over 70 lbs., without getting injured.  No complaints here. Great management and company."
good,When you first start the work is physical labor intensive. They offer a tuition reimbursement program that begins as soon as you are hired on. If you show initiative they will likely promote you from package handler to supervisor. Be prepared to work more hours for less pay as a supervisor.
good,I like the fast paste jobs. We work as a group getting the job done. Unloading the trucks at ups is time consuming. You stay busy and no time to clown around and thats the good thing about unloading trucks.
good,This job so far I experience the most growth. My manager taught a lot that'll help me with my future careers. I was put into situations at a young age that I will now know how to be able to handle at a later date.
good,"a typical day was stops in and out of town. weather was from warm day to wet snow. Driver kept close eye for safety of his helper. Thanks."
good,packing items and matching labels to correct packages.  Making sure packages get out on time to customers.  take care of customer complaints and correct the matter.  track missing packages and inform customers of there status.
good,"UPS is a great company, great first job for a student, offers student incentives and able to move up in the company, also ups has many shifts to work on making it felixable"
good,"Management was not the greatest. Neither was the work environment. It did have some pros. If you excelled during the work day sometimes they would give you free UPS hats , coffee mugs etc."
good,Great work envirernment that is welcoming. As well great benefits. Biggest downfall would be the lack of compensation compared to the rest of the demographic
good,"Good, temporary job for college kids on winter break."
good,Hard work environment which required long hours.  It can be kind of stressful and hard on mind and body because of long working periods.  Management can be unorganized.  Workers there are very sociable and friendly.
good,"Daily task were organizing, receiving, storing and handling newly arrived product. As well as maintaining the warehouse in a safe and orderly fashion."
good,Helped during my winter breaks from college. Got to deliver packages with drivers and also had experience in the sorting of many packages. Good job environment.
good,"Choice of shifts enables each employee to balance home life and additional employment to suit their needs. Environment is no-frills, extremely physical."
good,Evolving into new innovations due to other companies forming and competing for business. Always plenty of work due to fast paced industry. Facility management is lacking. Poor management skills and preparation. Typically last minute work authorizations from overwhelmed supervisors that seem unqualified to perform the tasks at hand yet somewhat routinely scheduled on a weekly/monthly basis.
good,Loaded tons of boxes into trailer during shift essentially playing Tetris.  Management at least the full-time supervisors were all pretty ruthless. Pay isn't so great until you get into full-time positions which will take quite a long time. You will get a pretty good workout doing this.
good,It was tough work but I’m thankful for them paying for school. I have made life long friends simply by going through tough nights together. It really is a war-like mentality
good,"The UPS hub, was awesome to work at. I met a lot of awesome people, that were looking to become drivers. The Manager that I worked under, always found a way to keep the crew going strong."
good,Basically at this location you need to be prepared to be yelled at by customers over things that don't seem like a big deal. Also be prepared to be asked questions that don't pertain to you and people thinking that you are USPS but you are UPS.
good,"Load and unload cargo `planes and jets at the airport"
good,Working here you have to be quick on your feet but otherwise its pretty simple. There are some rules and protocols you need to learn but once you get it everything is smooth sailing.
good,"Fast paced environment but very awarding at the end of each day. Everyone there is important to complete the daily mission and that is to get the customers there package(s) on time, every time. And all employees to go home as they came to work in one piece and healthy."
good,"The work was fast paced, but fairly organized and simple. The driver I worked with was very friendly, he was always at the pick-up location on time. I enjoyed getting to interact with all the customers on the route, and I especially enjoyed their pets. UPS was a pretty fun job and I would work there again if I could."
good,"Stressful and not a professional environment, the pay is average and co-workers are always stressed out, depending on your position it could be laid back or stressful."
good,I met some great clients and learned how to use programs that I had not had any experience with before. A lot of experience using photocopiers and learning how to do some minor repairs on them
good,They push hard to get the workload done for the day finished as fast as possible. The building isn't big enough to get the amount of freight in the amount of time it's expected. Tough work environment.
good,A good job for a second income or full time students. Great benefits for a part time union job. Short easy hours with many different shifts to match any schedule.
good,Straight forward company. Work hard and get paid decent. Move packages from one place to another or deliver from truck to residence. friendly environment but probably not the healthiest condtions.
good,"Being a driver at UPS is a very stressful job as what you do for management is never enough. They push you to work harder all the time and try to fire you over everything, On the brightside, you get to eat steak every weekend."
good,Ups is a good place if you need some money on holidays and want some hours. But after holidays work starts to become slow and the hours slow down a lot.
good,"First i would meet my driver at a designated spot, from there the driver and i would proceed too different businesses and residential areas to drop off packages that were being sent too them or take packages if they needed to be shipped out."
good,"UPS is a great company for individuals trying to figure out what careers they are interested in. The pay is top notch, but the hours are hard if you have a family."
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door, and move up.  With two routes management or hourly, the potential to satisfy every need is available.  "
good,"Typically the work day was very laidback, with several intense moments varying from shipping problems, claims or advanced customer service, requiring a store clerk to be prepared for stressful situations."
good,It was my first job and a good experience it was some times where I struggled but I still got through it and I refused to give up and it wasn’t the work that was really hard it was the supervisors making it harder than what it was and the only reason I’m not at the job now is because it was part-time and I was lookin for full-time
good,"It wasn’t that bad besides the fact that you were working outside, other then that it wasn’t that bad, people were friendly, outspoken, good intentions with everyone."
good,"No stress after you leave.  Hard physical work in a dirty, un air conditioned or heated factory.  Excellent union benefits for a part timer which kick in after 1 year service. Low pay."
good,I delivered packages during the Christmas season so it was long days and very fast paced. I learned how to drive the big package truck and how to devise plans for my daily route to improve daily.
good,"Good job "
good,great work place and exciting work! great job. wonderful place. lots of breaks. its active. its fun. its great job. wonderful job. clean place work is fun.
good,Was a okay plac to work. Boss was always there to keep us up to unload the trucks. Always nice. But it’s a fast past job. Always had to be on it unloading trucks
good,Working at UPS is painful be they gonna keep over 10hrs and everyone in there been in the hospital because of the job. And my friends are OSU football players and they  quit  After a few weeks because it was to much
good,"Some things that i learned were that UPS is a fast paced placed to work in however, it betters you I've seen people come and go just because of how competitive the work it self is. The joy of being a UPS employee are of  course the benefits."
good,"meet with driver. drive to each home on out list to deliver however many packages is on our DIAD. Being out in cold weather, ice, sleet, rain and snow you must dress accordingly."
good,Good company to work for. Hours are long and tough for work life balance. Great place for a young individual to start a career and learn a lot about a major organization
good,It's warehouse hard labor but once you master your technique work becomes easier. When you double shift that's were you start making the money. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Try to help others when you can but make sure your area is caught up before you go help someone else
good,UPS is a great company to work for as far as I am concerned. if you want a career and you have no job skills this is a great starting point. will definitely be working hard. Upward mobility is limited because frankly people stay there long term if they can make it past 3 years.
good,Pay was not worth the work you do during the season driver helper position. Worked 2 yes straight because regular job gives us 3 weeks off during holidays.
good,"A typical day is very labor intensive.  Even with all the automation, packages still have to be physically placed inside the vehicles for delivery."
good,I loved the customers but management was so unorganized and unprofessional. I cam definitely say I seen a lot of favoritism going on. So would I consider this a good place to work? Absolutely not!!
good,"i learned a lot working at ups. Teamwork was key , you couldn't get the job done correctly without communication and chemistry. I definitely took skills I learned with UPS throughout my everyday life"
good,"The most enjoyable part - the people I worked with, 3 day work days."
good,"The company had been much better 5 years ago or longer. Career advancement opportunities are limited, definitely politically motivated. No sense of how other companies operate, very focused on internal matters."
good,The job itself is not horrible..some day can be brutal and make you hate it.. it's all about the people there that make it working there tolerable.....
good,"excellent place to work,excellent benefits and extremely fast paced, the hardest part of the job is the lack of personal time and the changing culture"
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal driver helper while I'm in between jobs ""Medical Offices as a CMA"". It's defiantly more physical labor than I or most people are aware of, but the benifits out way that as even part time employees get full benifits paid by the company not just for the employees but their families! That's amazing in its self, and I hope to either get hired on full time after the holidays or even part time package handling at night for the benifits!"
good,ups really good to me cause work simple 4 hours that it and a week 25 hours pretty good but a lot of psychical more challenge me and more gain i love it
good,"The job itself is pretty simple and straight forward. It is noteworthy to mention that productivity may differ for someone else but the tasks are pretty simple and its not too stressful on your body. I am by no means in ""perfect"" shape but i was able to keep a steady pace and help get the packages delivered to the right address."
good,"A typical day at Ups for a loader, scanning 400 packages in one hour. 5 minute breaks inside trailers, smoke breaks. 30 minute lunch, vending machines available"
good,"For the position, the pay isn't terrible. The work is extremely fast, and can be very stressful. Often times reasoning behind choices aren't made clear to package handlers and we're told to simply accept them. It leaves us to feel that we can't get invested in the work beyond simply handling packages. With our limited scope of information we see some choices as illogical or even incorrect at times."
good,It’s a nice and interesting place to work. You can be yourself without be stress out . As longest you do your job you will be fine. The customers are great.
good,very fast pace work environment a lot of moving around picking boxes stacking boxes catching boxes that come off belt or putting boxes on belt friendly work place
good,"Was a great job and learned a large amount. Management could be better with supporting supervisors with continued training and development. "
good,Good place to work good work out everyday I go in. Maybe more hours will be better. Good people there to work with. The manager are great . And a good job to start a career
good,A typical day that I worked was proper packaging and weighing of items that needed to be shipped. Provided the best option for packages to be sent safely.
good,"Being a part time worker and not for a long time, i was not able to recieve"
good,"I met up with my driver every morning or afternoon, depending on which shifts I was needed. My task was simply to take packages to the doors and got a signature if needed."
good,"My typical day at work as a UPS Seasonal Package Handler was very quick and efficient. I would come in after noon most days, and immediately start delivering packages in surrounding areas of Winchester, Stephen City, etc. On average I worked for about 6 hours a day. It was a lot of physical activity so it kept me on my toes. Therefore, I learned to work in a fast-paced environment. Also, my driver(s) and the rest of management were very fair and hardworking towards me so that helped in my experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all of the new people."
good,Good company. Enjoyed my seasonal work experience. My trainer was great and showed me a lot of short cuts to saving time and distance in delivering packages for the Christmas season. Meet a lot of nice and interesting people
good,"Eventually you can get promoted (depends on how big the union, after you prove yourself and your cool under pressure. At first your soar from all the new muscles developing from all the going up steps carrying etc. The good thong is that after a while your multitasking like an octopus on zombie mode. I met alot of interesting people and some became friends. Best thing about the job was finding the beauty in the labor staying in shape and buying a house and toys."
good,It is a job for 4 hours a day so... The people there are helpful when you ask but fail to tell anything until the question comes up. The work is fast paced but in a relaxed way.
good,"it is a place of excitement and also need to work hard. one the customer complain:"
good,The UPS Store is small business atmosphere.  Is locally owned and operated.  Enjoy working closely with customers and other business owners succeed in their lives and/ professional lives by assisting them.
good,If you do not want to work then do not apply here. there is a lot of lifting different weights and sizes of boxes. very high paced environment. they start you off slow and try to bring you up to speed over time.
good,UPS was a experience to say the least I was a package handler meaning I unloaded trucks every night it wasn’t overwhelming you just have to keep your speed up and always pay attention to avoid injury
good,"Pros:"
good,"I have nothing to say,"
good,"Fast past work culture."
good,you will need to make sure you get your packages in your truck and make sure you don't leave any packages laying around because it will be a safety hazard.
good,I got the chance to learn the proper steps to pack and ship packages across the world. The work place is small and relaxed and you get to know your co-workers very well. Although the pay was low its a good first job to understand the workplace and even get a foot in the packaging workplace.
good,"I was a driver helper during Christmas season, it was a seasonal position. I enjoyed the driver and the management. It was fast paced and strenous at time but I enjoyed going to work. For the right people they offered full time driver jobs."
good,Its a good place to work at while in High School or any type of schooling. Very fast paced and must be able to lift all packages by oneself. Good work ethic is a must here.
good,"It was long days for a short time, high paced and fun but challenging and long during x-mas season. My driver told me what to do and we did it. Hard work and very straight forward"
good,"It was fun for the most part, nice people,  apparently awesome benifets if you stay, decent pay but not enough hours for me a in a work day and promoptions are either hit or miss or really slow."
good,"Ups isnt a bad place to work, I like the work I do, you can wear anything clothing you like, just work safe and comfortable. Make sure you stretch, eat light on the job, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated"
good,It was good to work for this company promotion came quick and fairly easy as long as you did your job. The only thing that wasn't great was dealing with the union made things more complicated.
good,A typical day as a Content Manager at UPS included synthesizing tariff information from multiple sources and integrating it into the proprietary web tool for customer use.
good,I worked as an package loader for 6 months and am now working as an driver in traning. Its a hard and physcially demanding job. Management is either hit or miss. I  have a very close and supportive relationship with my manager but mannagers like him are rare. Be prepaired to work hard and make sure you drink alot of water.
good,"It isVery fast paced"
good,Working at ups doesn't take much just good dedication persistence attitude it can get stressful being a package handler from being in the back of multiple hot ups trucks loading and unloading there's good team work but not really good communication skill due to the one I was working at in Austin Texas
good,The district manager is numbers driven. The guy thinks we live in the 1920's; therefore the culture isn't as good as it could be. The individuals in my terminal do not work ahead. Everyone does what they need to do in order to not be fired.
good,The work is hard physically. Mentally not as challenging but must have mental toughness to be able to endure. Making the right connections is a must for advancement.
good,"Working at UPS has instilled in me the importance of punctuality and dedication to getting the job done. Having to deal with my employees' different personalities and determine the best way to give them appreciative and constructive. "
good,Everyone starts at the bottom moving packages in hub. This job totally sucks. Its hard manual labor in a none heated or cooled facility. You will go home dirty and tired. But UPS only promotes from within. Which means everyone above you started wear you are. You can either stay in the Union and wait until you have enough seniority to bid your way into a better job with better compensation. This may take some time but you will get there. It is only a matter of time. Or you can join Management and try to work your way up through merit based promotions. Beware to get a full time management position you will need a 4 year degree. Either way you should eventually be able to support a family it just depends on the kind of work you want to do and if you want to play corporate politics to get a promotion.
good,fast paced working environment that is constantly busy. nice to feel the breeze riding in the truck though. watch for dogs ;) to bad my particular job duty was seasonal I would love to work for them again.
good,"there are busy days and slow days but, there is always something to do. Management is great. I've learned that there is a lot to do in this job and it's not easy. The co workers are great to work with but, still have it's usual drama but nothing no one can handle. Besides the drama everyone gets along."
good,"UPS is a fast paced and stressful job. In any position.There are very long days, however, you are well compensated. Especially once you get into the Driver position."
good,"My time at the UPS store was decent in time but great with coworkers. Everyone there was willing to help me learn regardless of how many questions I may have had. They are always more than willing to help with customer service and teach you some tips about customer care. In my time there I learn how to use Microsoft Office in more ways than I would have previous learned. Such as making business cards, Flyers, and posters for small businesses or personal needs."
good,Ups was a good experience .It was stressful and hardwork at times but my fellow employees were good workers and supervisors had well understanding how to manage.
good,The job is very fast. There is a certain time frame that everything must be done in everyday on time and on schedule which makes the day go by quickly.
good,UPS takes great care of their employees and do their best that they are compensated properly with the added benefit of annual and performance based raises.
good,UPS is a huge company I work at the air hub and things can be hectic during the unload equipment is old but we still manage to get the job done by any means.
good,"Work shifts are sometimes long, with additional helper for unloading trailers/with bulk products...environment could be a little friendlier..."
good,"The company has to get a new time clock, something is always wrong with the machine. And when can when can we start getting the benefits. The supervisor has to help when we need them ,  because any time you have a problem and you tell one of them, he will tell you to go to the next person or he /she cannot help you with the problem."
good,"The job was okay. It taught me that manual labor was not for me however helped me pick up on certain skills I may have been lacking. A typical day was from 9am-9pm of non stop moving, unloading,distributing, and helping others.The best part was seeign the truck that was sometimes filled from front to back empty after each and everyday."
good,Overall decent company to work for. 9 years there and I did what I had to do for those years. Ups just needs to recognize it's employee more often and recognize good workers and elevate them.
good,Your potential is umlimited....UPS is world wide so your are not confined if you were trying to relocate to a different city....The benefits are excellent and this is a company that has excellent retirement benefits
good,"Tough job. Feel rewarded by doing job and accomplished. No time for family or other aspects in life. Good pay, great benefits. If you get the job just be ready to work long hours and not much time to rest."
good,The UPS Store is a proud and tolerant place where people do hard work without trying to causing problems. It's employees are calm and well-disciplined.
good,"Ups is something i would recommend to anyone whos ready to work hard to bring home the bacon "
good,Was a seasonal Parcel Runner and ended up in clerical side. Very good knowledge of the parcel post system. Management was behind the scenes most of the time. Workplace culture is diverse. Physical work is a necessary part of job. Wages were probably the best part of the job.
good,"Very labor intensive job.  Stable work environment with excellent benefits package.  The work can become repetitive and a bit boring.  I enjoy working in a more physical capacity therefore the physicality of the requirements were not a problem, but at times I felt stagnant.  They offer many shifts therefore they are an excellent source of additional income."
good,"Worked on the dock to get the trailers loaded. Was a driver trainee, but stayed on the dock. Had to learn a lot of things on my own. Worked overnight, kind of a drag."
good,"It is great hours if you are a student looking for a constant evening job"
good,"It's a job that allows you to interact with different people, and meet many. Hard work gives great workout. Opportunities for promotions withing the company. Free transportation"
good,"Its a good place to work, job security and international recognized company. work is a challenge as it increase on daily basis, i worked four year in this company."
good,Every day my truck was pre loaded with my packages to deliver.  Most of the time they were arranged in order of stops.  Day was done when all packages on truck were delivered and other drivers in your area were finished.
good,"Average job.  Only work about 4 hours a day, its a lot of work for those 4 hours and it doesn't really pay enough at the end of the week. Training was good. Supervisors are nice and can be helpful for the most part."
good,"Great Company"
good,"UPS is a culture, an environment that must be customer focused and always make sure packages are delivered timely. You must be ready for ""anything"" to happen and act quickly, but safely to evaluate and fix the issue."
good,"Over all good place to work plenty of paid holidays "
good,"Hub operations is very fast paced and demanding work."
good,C’est une bonne entreprise mais’ nous devons rester longtemps intérimaire avant d’avoir innové contrat
good,Ups is a good job to work at they help you go to college. They have good benefits too you work Monday through Friday and they have different shifts they pay you 10.00 a hour
good,Job is always difficult at the beginning but you will get used to it. Experience workers always say the longer you work there the better your experience.
good,"I actually quit but that should not be a reflection of the company as a whole. I just didn't fit the gameplan that was laid out.The last 3 weeks I worked there I managed to work a total of about 12 hours, as a provider of 5, 4 hours a week is no good I tried to stick it out."
good,Its a relaxed job with cool people. The pay was alright for the job required. the management is not as organized with a lot of miscommunication between management and drivers.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you are willing to relocate.  Unfortunately, if you want to stay in AZ the room for promotions is limited.  Management can be supportive if you listen to their advice and raise your hands for open opportunities."
good,Was a over all challenging but rewarding job experience. From the starting class which was on safety and proper package handling to actually setting foot on the floor and working. It’s a physically demanding job and if you are willing to test yourself it’s for you.
good,"fast paced, physically demanding constantly on your feet.  Management range from young college kids as PT supervisors and FT supervisors who have been with the company for awhile."
good,"The job can be pretty exhausting, but it is a pretty easy to get the hang of. The pay advances quickly and after six months they provide you with free insurance."
good,"felt like I was being useful delivering the packages.  The driver I worked with and I made a good team.  "
good,Es muy buena empresa y cuenta con buenas atenciónes de parte de RH
good,not a bad place to work. i worked twilight shift which was difficult since i had to go to school all day afterwards. benefits are good and management is good.
good,"The freedom of creating your own schedule is great, however as with most Account Management positions, maintaining a work/life balance is difficult. "
good,This job is for a young person just starting off. Pay is good. The management team is supportive. I didn't want to leave the place. But the opportunity to advance was just not there.
good,"Great pay but it is hard work. It is more of a mental job, you have to really push yourself through the day. There are great benefits and your get up to 60 hours a week."
good,At times the amount of work was crazy but at other times it took forever to have anything to do. Everyone was friendly and down to earth. A very relaxing place to work.
good,"It is a great place to work for, but if you work at a call center, you might not have secured health benefits, no paid time off, no paid holidays, etc"
good,"Times have changed and UPS mentality is still a little behind the times.   Great company that pays well for hard work, however time to add some focus on the work life balance."
good,"If I had been younger when I applied, I'd still be working  there now. When I originally began working, I was a driver's helper and I LOVED it. Ever since I was a child I wanted to drive a ""brown truck"" so I thought with the helper experience, I'd have a chance. You have to have worked there for years before you can even be considered mostly because position advancement is based on seniority."
good,"I’m my humble opinion, it’s good to start at the bottom. It gives you a chance to see all levels of the operation. Advancement is encouraged and assistance is available to those who want it."
good,"Was a company that had good job opportunities, but was not for everybody. Management makes work load greater on those who put forth more effort. Everybody complains every morning. Benefits were great, but it seemed like the environment kind of drained the soul."
good,It’s very hard you have to be quick and it’s all abt team work getting the job done with your partners you can’t leave until your job is done and you and your partners are done
good,"This is an enjoyable job except for the obvious downsides to customer service. It is high stress at some points throughout the year, but there are so many different things to do that it's rarely ever boring."
good,"Anyone not willing to work hard need not apply. There is plenty of advancement opportunities and great pay plus benefits. Depending on location, some managers need to work on their organization and people skills, but otherwise UPS is a great place for career opportunities."
good,"direct supervisor was supportive, however there was a lot of cliques, which could really make a working atmosphere toxic. Great benefits, room for advancement."
good,Come to work on twilight shifts
good,"Make sure all the packages are loaded on the correct routes. Complete pre sort, post sort, and day after reports. Inventory supplies to make sure we keep needed materials to operate."
good,"Pros"
good,"Each day I met my driver at the same parking lot and started work when I entered the delivery truck. This job was very easy, but maybe because I enjoyed working with my driver."
good,"Working for UPS was fun, but yet a fast pace consistent job.I was there 10 yrs and throughout those years i have grown and learned during my time i was there......The people and environment  are great.....The benefits are awesome....."
good,"UPS is a great place to work as long as you are a hourly union employee. the ""part time"" supervisors are treated poorly and are expected to accomplished goals without the proper resources, and punished if the goals are not met."
good,"UPS can be a wonderful place to work for, they just need to work better on more full time advancement opportunities so that their workers can dedicate their time more fully to the company. They need more article 22 positions."
good,Waiting around for customers to help and can be slow. I am one of VERY FEW stores open on Sunday's and its a hit or miss. UPS stores are independently owned franchises and all have different set prices.
good,great place to work fun and fullied with great people. i would walk in and pass the metal detectors and go to clock in and start loading 3 or more trucks at a time
good,Had alot of work hours. It  also had a fast pace to it but it wasn't a problem. It was a good job and the managers were alright. Its easy to learn and not hard to do.
good,"I started working at UPS part-time in college. I loaded the delivery trucks in the early morning. Typical shift lasted 4-5 hours. I was asked to join management but at part-time status. I turned it down waiting for a full time position. Delivery driver became available which I applied for and was chosen for the position. However, I didn't have my own route. I was a fill in for vacations and call-ins. Although the training was good. They didn't train you for every route. I often found myself on routes where I was unfamiliar or not working at all. I became quickly unsatisfied with my employment."
good,"Start sweating 10 min. into shift because of work load. During Peak business season can work 8-9 hours strait with only 1 10 minute break, unpaid. Very physical work loading packages up to 150 lbs."
good,A good place to work for college students on break looking for extra spending cash. 
good,"UPS is a great place to work. It was exactly what I was looking for when I applied. The pay could be a lot better to start because of the work being done through each day. Also, with the Christmas season, or ""peak season,"" ending, the hours were cut significantly for the shift that I work for."
good,Working at ups is tough because it is constant lifting and lowering of packages ranging from 10 - 80lbs. I would only refer this to someone who is willing to break a sweat.
good,"Good company, worked there under staffing companies for 21 years never hired."
good,"I was only there for a short period of time but it was fun working there. I was there sorting packages that came my way, and i was also  loading trailers"
good,ok to work place .Need a better management.Is the sefety and safety only for drivers and workers .Give you un apportunity  go to school online and finish your education or start one on discount rate.
good,"Unloading and reloading packages onto trucks.  Being a good people person by working with others,  establishing good relationships with the other employees and management."
good,Well the work experience depends on your work ethic. It really depends on how long you wanna remain with the company. You can go down the supervisor road or go for driver. But the pay ain't really good when you start. You have to work your way up to the top.
good,This was a cool place to work for the time I was there the only problem is the lack of hours part time isn't feeding anyone in 2018 they need to get that full time available.
good,"For 1 year, I loved my job as a package handler and I loved with the people that I worked with. Pivoting, loading, and unloading boxes was an awesome exercise to catch up. It has timely and efficient manners. I left my job for full-time opportunities. The working conditions were in good rating. So if want to load packages, then I suggest your bring your working gloves! :-)"
good,Basically i just helped manage and keep the packages organized and in order as well as bringing them to the address on the package.  it was what you would expect from a package delivery service
good,"The job itself is a rejuvenating. Simple, straight-forward, low on stress."
good,"Job is very physical and hard on your body, but it was a good work-out.  Driving could be stressful, but interesting to see new areas of the community and meet different people.  The worst part was the long hours especially in peak season, often working 60 hours per week."
good,"Working at UPS you realize that your kind of under paid. My position is very multi-tasking and sometimes stressful. I am a supervisor for 60 employees and out of that 60, about 50 are truck drivers so dispatch and time cards are a requirement."
good,Fast peace at times very stressful. But you can vital work experience  and knowledge of the importance of getting the customer package to them on time. it gives you a appreciation that your helping some little kids dream come true. helping that person who is waiting on and organ or something of vital importance. You help make that happen.
good,A few good people to work with but the lack of training provided is unbelievable very fast paced environment though was able to multitask efficiently in different roles.
good,"Working for a UPS facility is a fast-paced and somewhat stressful job depending on your position. The pay is ok, but the hours are incredibly flexible and can allow for a great amount of overtime. The people who work there are generally easy to get along with so long as you can keep up with your work. The difficulty of the work varies from day to day, with some days being complete cake-walks and other days leaving you completely exhausted."
good,"As soon as I arrived at my duty station, I begin to sort through all the packages.  Using my hand scanning to determine which truck or bin to place the packages in. Everything was timed and you had to complete your assigned task within the limit."
good,"Great part-time work, fast paced, and decent pay. The fellow employees at this company are great to be around and help you enjoy your work. Would recommend to someone looking for great part-time work."
good,This was Seasonal position. When hired I was told 40 hours but most weeks only worked 20 and was let go several weeks before the date I was told. If hired full time this is a great company with good pay and benefits.
good,"The  Hub is  on Go at  all times. I loved driving for them. The hardest part of the job for me.Were not knowing the package  weight until delivery and alot of walking,hills and  and all sorts of animals.Ugh"
good,we usually show up early during the day then get ready for a 8-10 hour day of sorting and moving boxes for about 5 days out the week and during seasonal time the pay is good
good,Serving as a Personal Vehicle Driver for UPS was a new and enjoyble experience. A typical day was to meet my driver and obtain packages out for delivery in rural areas. Management and Union workers seemed to butt heads on a daily basis..
good,"The management genuinely cares about you and your safety, ensuring that everyone is properly stretched out and is reminded of nightly safety tips. The work at times feels can feel tedious, but is very rewarding when it's all said and done. Although the work is demanding, management often does little things to boost morale, such as providing radios to listen to music while you and coworkers are working or bringing snacks around for people to stay energized."
good,good job good money health care week ends off starting hours good trucks good tools for unloading and loading trailers good routes bid start times union
good,I learned how to be a package runner the driver that i worked with was a real good person the hardest part of the job was working outside in the cold and rain Management i didnt see them
good,"Grow the business, make connections and increase customer base. Work with operations to ensure customer satisfaction and increase revenue. Challenges are competing with competitive carriers and showing value of why customer should use our services. Negotiating price verses portfolio of services to save time and money."
good,"start work slow pace pick up from the shift before not bad ever but half way through must send two people home, work then gets slammed and we are behind, move fast and then we pick up and clean up at the end of the night so its clean for the next shift"
good,"good career choice, start young in the corporate area, save maximum for retirement and retire early. stay in good phiysical shape . keep your driving record clean"
good,"Pack,  guide and on to the next package. Tho it's ups it actually is as simple a job as a packing job in a warehouse. Very boring , good thing is your allowed headsets."
good,"A typical day would be loaded and unloaded packages onto trucks while making sure they were placed in the right places. it was very hectic, if you are not strong, I wouldn't recommend this for sure"
good,"Typical day at work was loading 2,000-2,500 packages in a 73 ft trailer. Teamwork was key at this job and tyhe hardest part about this job was the mental motivation you must have for yourself."
good,"It was a great experience, especially going into a field of work ive never done before. You learn alot in a short of time, but i'd say it isn't a job for everyone."
good,"Too many spoons in one bowl! No one ever knows what’s going one, poorly managed and not enough of trucks. Too many deliveries for one driver, and very little hours. I was promised full time position and after 4 months (season busy holiday months) they told  me they had no hours for me any longer!"
good,"-The daily routine for the preloaders is loading 3 package cars a day while using scan tech "
good,"During the interview we were assured that we would get hours; however, that wasn't the case. Work hours were very unreliable. I enjoyed working for the driver I was assigned to. The seat for the helper was uncomfortable."
good,"Good place to work, in between jobs. Not much of a chance to advance if you're not in school. People are nice, laid back, will work.with your daily schedule."
good,I was lucky to have this job not only the job but the driver I was assigned was patient with me but direct and was working me to ensure that was on the job even tho I was seasonal
good,a typical day is very fast paced...you don't have time to eat..jump on and off the truck deliver packages. Got to be a people person and have good communication skills dealing with different people The management is not with you. Driver is the one who tells you what to do the cluture is great if you like to see new places.The hardest part of this job is watching out if someone has dogs that may attack. I learned that it takes hard work to deliver packages & to feel people out.
good,"UPS is a fast paced business with heavy lifting. It is a extremely physical. Highly busy nonstop, management is hands on and helpful. If you do not mind working hard this is the job for you."
good,UPS was a good company to work for. It was a seasonal position. It had a lot of hours. I interacted with a lot of people all day working for UPS. Overall a good experience.
good,The hiring process is convuluted and unpredictable. It is set up to promote from within if you can work part time for an extended time. They will send you home without prior notice if volume is down without regard to your financial needs. It is clear that you are merely a number
good,I only was a driver helper but i enjoyed my time. My driver leon was super friendly and easy to learn from. i never knew ups had so many packages to deliver around the holidays.
good,"They work you very hard but utilize many /t positions to avoid paying a salary.  They benefits are good and the management is supportive, but they fall short in advancing people to what should be full time positions"
good,its a good job for making some cash but it sucks because if you are a student or have other things going on in your life it is an everyday commitment and is five days a week.
good,I enjoyed my stint at UPS.  It was one of my first jobs straight out of college and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  No real complaints. I left because I needed a full time job.
good,"At UPS you will constantly be on your feet working. Very physically demanding and high stress, but the benefits outweigh the negatives of the job. Management was extremely condescending."
good,"The job is seasonal and straight forward. The employees are pleasant.A typical work day begins with a call from the driver, and scheduling a meeting point. Packages are delivered on time and also arranged according to location.."
good,"Fast pace job, sort mail from letter to 10 pound packages or more , put mail on pallets to be shipped out.  friendly work teams, everyone worked together, helping each other out."
good,"It was a good job, it was just seasonal so I don’t have a big description on ups. I was the helper for the driver and my driver was good. He educated me on the job and how I should apply after the season was up. Unfortunately I didn’t hear back from them, but I thing Ups would be a good career choice."
good,You will start either loading or unloading and will have to move up in the company from there. It will be part-time unless told otherwise. The normal wait to move is 1 year.
good,"A good place to get trained on picking and packing, also using a rf scanner, cycle count, and train you on operating forklifts. A good place to gain experience to start picking and train to learn how to operate forklifts"
good,"Ups offers a lot of benefits to their employee's however you have to work there a year at the very bottom of the totem pole struggling to get through every day with an extremely fast pace, and a lot of strength mentally and psychically."
good,Face pace. How to load and unload a trailer. Work at night didn't see management. Was a mixture. There was nothing hard about loading and unloading trucks. The hour was nice.
good,UPS has relatively high integrity and their employees are dedicated. If you're willing to give up some work/life balance there are ample opportunities for advancement.
good,"Im großen und ganzen gut, da man sich die Pausen selber einteilen konnte"
good,"There was a nice balance between the fast paced work and the down time between stops, it was stressful at times but nothing i couldn't handle. I would definitely recommend it to friends of mine."
good,"You go in move some packages for about 3 hours or more a day and that's about it. I learned how the packaging  process works and all its pieces to get that task done. Management was week point in the job with poor and sometimes harsh communication between management and regular package handlers, this created friction between work areas (sort, unload, load, small sort) and union alike often with an ""us vs. them"" attitude. The hardest part of the job was trying make my transition form package handler to management, the bar that was held was not held by my superiors and i couldn't find myself happy in that position. As a part time package handler with the union and less worries on my side i was able to accomplish goals in my job field and outside of work that i wouldn't have expected."
good,I'll give a 75% for the benefits and discounts and things like that it's just not enough money for me I would say but it's an ok job to have for benefits wise
good,"The levels of management that I have met thus far at UPS are friendly, motivating, and safety-minded. However, I have also noticed that direction from some senior management and PT-supervisors to employees is inconsistent, and that there is not a consistency of holding to the company's standards."
good,"I worked nights. This made us the anchor shift. We had to get the work done no matter what. The people I worked with were top notch. My managers were the best I've worked with in years. It was fast paced and very physical but, it was rewarding. The only downside is that you need years in to make a decent living. I would have stayed if the hours and pay were better."
good,"A time sensitive operation/always under pressure to exceed demands of weather, customers and the clock. A regimented format, as close to being in the military without being in the military."
good,"not a bad place to work. just a lot of heavy lifting, good hours and everything s fast paced. Just not a good fit for me, im more comfortable in leadership and management positions"
good,This is a fast paced job where you always are doing something. Standing all day and customers can be difficult sometimes. Management could support more with training and continuous check-in's with employees would be nice.
good,"My time working at The UPS Store provided a lot of learning experiences for me. For the most part throughout the year the pace of work was steady, but obviously business picked up around the holidays. Did not feel like I got much support from management."
good,"Great Company to work for if you want job security, nothing else. It appears as if the employee's benefits keep disappearing on a year to year basis even though the Company makes billions on a quarterly basis."
good,"Great job for people that can sleep during the day or have no night life.  The work is hard work and very fast paced but you are rewarded with full days to do what you like, work a second job or go to school"
good,"Work environment is great as well as salary and benefits but work schedule is always unstable. A"
good,"Overall great place to work. "
good,"If you like working your but off for low wages then this is the job for you, a day here is like a day in the desert with no water and no shade you are expected of a lot just starting out"
good,"Good company to work for, was flexible with hours and lots of overtime and promotional opportunities which allowed to advance quickly, Pay was not adequate to the work done and ended up leaving for more money."
good,The UPS Store is a challenging and fast pace store that provides the highest customer service relationship with each of their customer to provide a great autmospher for emplyoees and customers alike.
good,"I only was at UPS for a short time during the Christmas rush. You more or less get hired on the spot and they try to post you close to home. I worked as an assistant on the trucks delivering packages. I got lucky that I was happy with my driver and the area I was working in. There is a LOT to do in a day and if you're under preforming they will not call you back for more shifts, It was hard but also satisfying that you were able to accomplish so much in the course of your shift."
good,"Rendez vous sur Paris avec un chauffeur."
good,Interacting with the customers was fun. Shipping and receiving packages nationwide was interesting. Solving problems that customers encountered when shipping a package made their day as well as mine.
good,"it is a face paced worked place to unload the trucks and then reload the tractor trailor,  going out with the driver on his route was nice, it was a change of pace"
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Lack of reliable transportation from work during late am hours is why i had to leave. If things didnt play out as such I would still be happily employed here. Great coworkers, hard nosed yet down to earth management, and just an overall amazing work enviornment. If there were to be a postion opening I would recommend it to any and everyone. Great company"
good,"Poor management in the Pacific, WA facility. Stressful working environment and hard to advance with the company. Hours from 1or 2am until 9 or 10am Monday through Friday or Tuesday through Saturday."
good,"As a supervisor, the only way your gonna go full time is if your boss retires. They can help with school, but honestly that's all this job is good for."
good,"UPS is a good job to have if you're looking to turn it into a career or if you're going to school. It can be stressful at times, but if you can stick it out, it can be very rewarding."
good,"Time is money and UPS never lets you forget that. Everything is about the on-time network. Dispatching loads on time is paramount . This requires employees to meet efficiency standards (load/unload pieces per hour) that are somewhat difficult to maintain throughout a shift. Once those efficiency standards stop being met, packages start to pile up and jams begin to form on conveyors. Dealing with those problems as they arise or, ideally, identifying them before they actually occur is my responsibility with my group of employees."
good,There options of advancement aren't presented clearly. There should be more opportunity to grow within the company. The turn over rate isn't high which can go hand and hand with the promotion opportunities.
good,"working at ups puts hair on your chest. you are constantly lifting up to 70lbs onto or off a conveyor belt and filling in wherever you are needed. there is a heavy amount of pressure to finish the shift before 9 am, but it was nice getting paid to go to a gym more strenuous than Crossfit"
good,only worked a few months and they let me go cause I worked for a temp service.  if u work for a year they let u go anyways . my supervicer was nice...
good,"very high stress"
good,It was a fun workplace when the owner was not around.  We always did our jobs well however the owner brought his personal life into the workplace and it was like you never new what was going to happen.  He would threaten to kill himself and we could not work under these conditions.
good,"Fast paced work environment,and you're basically working in a warehouse so whatever the conditions are outside is basically what you will be working in. More opportunities come in the holiday seasons."
good,"I had a temporary position at UPS during their Peak season and I loved the job. It's a very fast paced job that left me tired at the end of the day, but I felt accomplished knowing that I had gotten all of my packages out to the consumers."
good,"As long as you are looking for work, there is work to be done. The more you show that you are willing to work, the more responsibility will be assigned to you. If you are patient and dedicated, you will advance."
good,"Had the opportunity to learn from the owner to we created flyers, posters and business cards for customers"
good,"You work hard for 5.5 hours a day supervising employees who talk back, dont want to do their work and then the drivers come in and it starts all over again. If you can get a full time position you get paid really well but even that takes forever and be prepared to fight upper management because for the most part they do not know the job duties of the person below them so they are clueless to the problems that creep up. If you have the choice dont go the supervisor route, stay with the Union and go driving it will pay off more in the long run."
good,"I learned that I am far more flexible in my working environment than I had ever thought possible. After I became ill with chronic migraines, my management team at the time went to bat for me to work from home so that I could keep my job. For the most part, the people at the office where I worked were great to work with... even on our bad days, we all pulled together to get the job done. For me the best part of the job was being able to keep busy, even after beginning to work remotely. The hardest part of the job was that my position at the company was moved to another division four times in eight years."
good,"Have to be capable of heavy weight lifting. Loading, shipping and receiving in a high paced.  Either then that a great, respectful working place. Great management."
good,"In the summer it's nice. lots of customers, plenty to do. "
good,"I would drive my box-truck to Pueblo, Canon City, Colorado Springs, then back to Denver everyday.  I absolutely loved my route and wouldn't have wanted to trade for any other route."
good,"UPS is a great place and employer to work with. Lot of room to learn and enhance your skills."
good,"Wasnt too bad. some of the management was really nice, actually treated me like a person compared to some management treating me like a grunt. Started loading up the box cars and had too many problems with management pushing me to work faster. On the other hand, working on the PD lines loading the Tracter Trailers was very fun, was treated to free food at the end of every week for keeping our rates as high as possible, treated like i was part of the group."
good,"Alot of good things to say about UPS.  Its hard work, but some really great people who really care about the company.  Would recommend to many people getting their career off the ground"
good,"my typical day was very busy, had a lot of multi-tasking, learned new programs and had to teach other supervisors the programs my managers up until the last one were excellent, loved working with them, I can't think of anything that was very hard of the job, and the most enjoyable was helping the customers or the employees with their payroll problems and some employment problems"
good,"This was just a seasonal position. I didn't really work there long enough to for a responsible opinion of this company. I had fun while I was there, though."
good,"The UPS Store is a team effort. Everybody works together to accomplish the goal for the day. However there are positive competition for the part-time workers to increase the worker's engagement."
good,"It was a nice place to work. i had a great a manager , like the hours. parking was difficult. like the shops and store around the store. it just needed work"
good,"I could handle the work but the way the location was ran, it was terrible. They make you keep working through injuries, they don't keep the area as clean as possible, etc."
good,"Learned how to use the diad for scanning and inputting information, company issued uniform, a lot of lifting and walking. Must be in decent shape. Had a patient and informative driver, so the experience was great."
good,United Parcel Service is involved in the transportation of small package ground and air packages on a global basis. The opportunity to advance exist for current and future employees
good,this job was very high paced you will be tired after those hours overall great work place for a entry level position you will be a senior citizen by the time you get full time tho :)
good,"Buen ambiente, se te trata genial, horarios un poco insociables pero hay descansos adecuados"
good,"takes 20 years to be a full time warehouse worker 20 years."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here. It was mostly a graveyard shift, but i managed to move up in positions quickly based on my hard work and what i learned through other people."
good,Good place as long as you don't mind getting a little dirty. good management. good people to work with. not stressful but heavy lifting and a little noisy
good,"Overall,  not a terrible beginner job. Being a part of the Teamsters union allows for great healthcare benefits, but at a steep cost. In order to be considered a ""full timer"" and earn more than 25-27 hours a week, one must work for the union for at least five years... "
good,"Company will push you to achieve business goals which in turn, makes you a better supervisor. When you first start at UPS, the wage is not great and the hours are minimal. Be prepared to work hard and for very little pay. Best case scenario, keep another PT job to supplement your income while waiting to get a FT job at UPS."
good,"They provide a work from home option.  Supervisors receive good benefits and fair salaries.  The test required to become a supervisor is difficult, but the compensation received is worth the test."
good,"Good early workout job, good hours.  a very upbeat work environment with hours usually available all year long.  this is a great company to work for being they want you to grow."
good,Management would make a point to let the employees that work hard  know that they are appreciated. I learned how to assist callers in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job would be to explain certain situations while still following security guidelines.
good,"In the international department, we scan and check the packages that are going to international locations.often,  Some maybe illegal or some may have been missing the required paperwork to get to its destination, so we call the customer to get the proper paperwork."
good,Work is not very hard once you know what you are doing. I have learned the proper way to pack items away for shipping. Management is excellent. Its basically a family type vibe at work. The hardest part of the job is working to the specifications of the owner of the store's expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet all the customers and getting to build a rapport with them.
good,"Great job for going to school or for advancement options that could expand into a stellar career. Packing was very quick paced in order to keep up with the package loading in time for shipment. The problem I ran into is the manager I had came down on my team leader for training mistakes in the first 2 weeks and let me go when I was supposed to have 90 days. HR was NOT happy with him as he burns through new hires without properly training and giving a chance. They are also VERY strict with attendance as I saw others miss a day and get let go. Finally, heavy union dues for the first set number of hours. Otherwise great benefits and fair pay and hours for each position."
good,"I spent my career with UPS - you will never work harder, you develop a work ethic that is not duplicated out there in the real world."
good,"A typical day is to delivery all packages on time and to the right place."
good,"I worked at a UPS store. We were a retail shipping and packing center. We were not owned or operated by UPS. For the most part it was a good job, but it is retail so you have to work weekends and deal with stupid customers."
good,"I grew up in this company, from age 19.  The single utmost important thing I learned, was integrity.  It was a very ""mom and pop"" culture when I started there in 1985.  However, by the end of my career at UPS in 2015, it was a completely different company.  We had gone public in 1999, and the culture was never the same."
good,Management hard to get on with .plus you pick up lots of fines if you make mistakes or miss time delivery and forget to put missed delivery tickets through door other than that good company to work for
good,"UPS was a very engaging and physical environment which I enjoyed however, the management wasn't not able to treat the employees properly. Yelling at employees to get a job done isn't acceptable."
good,Great pay and benefits they don't make it easy for you to get promoted or move the areas in the company also they have management will assist with calls when the numbers are high
good,"Loved working there, very friendly atmosphere. I love customer service. Working with the public is what I enjoy best. I excel in that kind of atmosphere. I also enjoyed having a great staff of employees to supervise. I work very well with others and and enjoy fast pace work."
good,"It is a good place to work at over all. It's not too fast and it's not too slow. If it wasn't for me going back to school, I would still be working there. The only thing I have to complain about is its lack of days off."
good,"It got really hot in the summer, but it's only a 4 to 5 hour work day so it goes by quick. There are a great variety of people that will be met at this place and they are all great!"
good,"Dealing with irate customers that that had problems you didn't have answers could be pretty frustrating. The people I worked with made  being there fun. I learned about the customers had plenty of issues with ups side of the shipping industry, and heard some strange and interesting stories in my short time there."
good,Once you get past the few weeks struggling to get your first paycheck because their payroll system is a mess. The managers are not coordinated and will often contradict each other but otherwise a great experience where they will let you do your own thing
good,"busy job could only work part time because of the amount of people working their other than that great team,great surroundings and constant work the only downside was not enough hours so not enough money to live other than that great experience."
good,N/A it was nice and very welcoming. Loved that they took their time teaching and helping. They messed up my money multiple times and I didn't like that.
good,The last franchised I worked at had an owner that had no experience with UPS Stores so he didn't really know how they operated. I enjoyed the work itself but not the owner.
good,Worked on the air-ramp unloading and loading planes. Learned to operate various machinery. Lots of paid downtime. Opportunity to work overtime most nights
good,My job started at 3 am and lasted until 9 am. I had to unload and load trucks as fast as humanly possible. It really sucked but it was an okay job. Good second job.
good,A day at UPS is very hard work and hard labor. As the unloader unloads the merchandise to the belt the packages comes to me and I am responsible for sorting the packages to the right belt. I also feel like management doesn't know how to run the UPS hub. The hardest part about working for UPS is that it gets very hot in the warehouse.
good,Loading and unloading packages over 70lbs to 100lbs. Carry unregistered packages that are not registered to the truck out the truck to a line that brings the package to its rightful place. At the end of the day clean work place and bring all packages to the line for the next shift to start.
good,È un ambiente molto caotico umanamente parlando ma estremamente preciso nell orgsnizzaxione lavorativa!
good,Short hours but extremely hard labor. It will take a toll on your body after many years. Great benefits but depending on location hard to move up in the company because of seniority.
good,"It Is chaotic and well organized at the same time. A typical day would be for us is to go in about 5:00pm and clock in then you wait for management to tell us  to START! then we ""work"" for 1.5 hr then break for 10mins then ""work"" for 1 last hour and then clock out about 8:30 pm- 9:00pm"
good,Great for students and for those seeking health benefits. Not enough hours so you'll need a secondary job unless tuition assistance is taken advantage of. Retirement plan is a plus to bolster other plans.
good,"The people were very cool, management was a little less than helpful due to the high stress environment. In order to avoid stress stay in the union and keep your job secure."
good,Took each box given to me by the driver to the right house. I worked about 5 hours every day. The work is a little bit physically demanding; the boxes can be a bit heavy. The driver I worked with was laid back. He picked me up every Mon-Fri at the same location.
good,"Great union to join, but most non-union workers (management) had no idea how to make the job better; only worse. Many workers were subjected to verbal abuse by hypocritical supervisors and even inefficient managers. The union would usually only help those who had worked there for 5+ years, and the payroll after taxes and FICA were deplorable... below poverty conditions. I only recommend this job if you're planning to use the fairly decent benefits and do not care about making money."
good,"Overall its a great company with a lot of room for advancement and a lot of perks for loyalty. However, it is a very difficult job to only start out at 10.50. The Harrisburg Hub on Day shift makes you work every sunday no matter what which is ridiculous. They make you work easter, memorial day, labor day, etc."
good,A fun job with great benefits  How ever Management has to many double standards in reguards to company policy and procedures that will cause injury or death to the employees.
good,"Unless you want to go Driver or Management, there is very little job advancement available. "
good,Ups was probably the best company I've worked for the benefits was nice and that was my first wearhouse job so everything was new to me but the staff made sure I learned everything I needed to to succeed
good,"Overall a good place to work, owners are married couple. Wife, is awesome boss who keeps store running efficiently. Husband, is a chauvinistic know it all who verbally belittles his wife in office, also hinders good working policies as to exert his male dominance in store. Manager is a pleasant girl with an amazing work ethic. The store was run much better when husband stays home."
good,"Everyone will usually tell you UPS is a great place to start working , and if you start young enough you will be full time in a jiffy.  Those people have probably never worked at the Rockford Air Hub.  The actual job is pretty fantastic. You get all of the ups benefits that people rave about, and that is pretty great.  Generally speaking all of the coworkers I have met are decent enough to work with and pass the time with.   But after nine years I am no closer to working full-time than I was nine years ago.  They consistently hire new supervisors that have no idea what the job actually entails because they usually have never had experience doing it.  The job is also union.  Some people may like that, but all that has meant in my experience is there is no hope firing deserving individuals because of attitude or safety concerns."
good,There was very bad communication through supervisor and employee. The breaks were only 10 minutes and that was to eat your lunch as well.  But the co-workers were very fun to get to know
good,Processing packages coming and going.Hardest part of the job was working at night I worked in a warehouse it was cold in the winter and hot in the summer
good,"Ups is a great company if you're with the union or full time. Part timers are treated just like the amount of their paycheck."
good,The supervisor belittled the package handlers and treated them/us lile we were worth out pay. There was no advancemtn because after 90 days there was a review and i was let go
good,"Fast Pace Environment, Got to unload 52' Trucks in a certain amount of time. The weight of the Items we unload range anywhere between 0 to 70lbs. Managers were pretty decent and worked with you as much as possible. Hardest part of the job was unloading trucks on a very hot day. No AC Unit but has a Fan on each unload dock.Enjoyable part of the job was majority of the workers were very helpful in making sure you complete your daily assignments."
good,"a nice part time job that allows you to home with kids most of the time, very good benefits for part time job with 401K, dental, medical and retirement"
good,"A typical day at UPS, would start off pretty good then get heavier throughout the day. I have learned things working at UPS such as how to communicate better with my fellow workers."
good,"Requires hard work and commitment. Often times long works, especially during Christmas. UPS pushes its employees to work extremely hard. Compensation and benefits are fantastic."
good,UPS is a fast moving type of job. Al though most won't like this type of job I'm sure many enjoy the workout as a whole. In the winter time it get very cold and uncomfortable and in the summer time it gets hot and uncomfortable as well and people have their preference working in cold or hot weather.
good,"This also includes picking up loose pieces of merchandise from the floor. "
good,UPS FRIEGHT is a great company to work for. the job is easy. you only work 4-6 hours a day mon-fri. The only bad i can say is the terminal manager. He is a major backstaber and likes to micromanage...he has his complains of the week and likes to TRY and intiminate you..UPS should get rid of him!!!!
good,Management is always there to help. Easy to learn and build basic customer service skills to help excel in future careers. The diversity of your customers helps you grow as an individual and employee.
good,"Il y avait une bonne ambiance au travail, c'est important !"
good,"willing to work harder. ups was a great company it will always come in handy . when it need to, as far as working hard . you can gain more experience in the future ."
good,This place is a great place to work besides the fact it is kind of hard to become a full-time worker for this exact location. It is very fast-paced environment.
good,The typical day is always fast paced and you have to be aware of always being professional and habitually learn to smile when enter acting with resident and business people.You must maintain quality delivery no matter the weather or long hours.In the warehouse you have to be attentive to ensure packages or loaded on right truck.
good,"I enjoy working at The UPS Store.  It is a clean and friendly atmosphere.  The workday goes by very quickly.  However, I wish health care benefits were provided."
good,"Productive and good people to work with, although company and management was never happy, which would stress employees on a daily basis.  Overall good benefits and good company."
good,"Salary compensation for management is very competitive & fair. "
good,Great opportunity to interact with other employees. Typical days was filled with opportunities for engagement. No two days were alike. Dynamic work environment.
good,"Für eine ungelernte Kraft ist dies ein sehr gut bezahlter und sicherer Arbeitsplatz."
good,good home work life. you finish work and have the entire day to handle other task you may have or enjoy time with the family.  best to start early in life so you have the opportunity to advance.  Pay for entry level will not support you.  however benefits are great
good,"Seasonal position, it was fast paced and the hours were later in the day than I hoped but it was good, my shifts didn't start till late in the season though which was annoying"
good,I was only a seasonal worker and it was OK.  Was on a call basis.  My schedule was never the same and was hard to plan anything.  Other than that it was good.  Great work out.
good,UPS is a good company to work for because of the benefits and they pay once you have put some time in. You also have to deal with a lot of stuff that goes on during your work shift.
good,"Hard work, no brakes, really nice people, extreme variations in hours, the facility it's self is really nice as are most of the people you will work with. There's only a few down falls like the fact that there's no breaks, and your hours very a lot depending on the day."
good,"a typical day at work was busy"
good,was good   cant complain. had to wake up at 2am but other than that it wasent bad. nice people as well.  would maybe worl there again
good,"I loved it here, the customers were great and so were my co-workers. BUT management had its flaws, and it was because the manger and owners were the same people. I loved most parts of my job but having to listen to husband/wife fights while at work made it a very stressful place to work. I would not work there again, but I would love to try working at another UPS Store."
good,There were too many managers and not enough agreement on the duties of the employees. you would get in trouble with one manager for doing what another manager tells you to do lack of communication between authority figures.
good,"Has great benefits, enjoy working with others and have learned a lot also have had supervisors in the past that have not always been far in the way that they have treated others."
good,Working at UPS is not easy because everything is fast paced and you are expected to do everything correctly in a timely manner. Supervisors were okay with work with. The company doesn't pay enough for what you go through as a package handler. They are the real MVP's!
good,it was pretty cool while i was there. the employees are okay. Every store tries to maintain clean as much as possible. the was no real hard work though. this would be a great as someones first job.
good,They is not a organized company to work for and managers do not no how to treat there in employees. They have great benefits and is a good company to work for if you're a driver but far as a dockworker it's a long process to go through if want to advance in that position
good,"This job requires quick reflexes and optimal strength. The loaders often get backed up from package flow.  The customer counter is fun to interact with public most times, and the computer systems are terrific. The work environment is definitely lively."
good,"Recommend it for students and for those looking for extra hours to augment."
good,My typical day was a normal 8-6 day. I learned valuable driving skills for commercial vehicles. My co workers were outstanding and made my job much more enjoyable.
good,"A great job/ work experience. I learned alot while I was there. Worked in dispatch as well as the freight dock logging freight information, assigning drivers and forklift operators."
good,A typical day at work for me was loading a truck with packages. But I could not find what I liked most about the job as I was only there for 2 weeks. After that I was sent on my way. The hardest part of the job was keeping the scanner on my hands. Without being able to keep the scanner on your hand you cannot meet the quota they set for you.
good,Very engaging and very fast pace atmosphere. Really teaches you how to grow and be more responsible. Lots of great people within the company. It becomes your second home and the people become your family.
good,"Horrible Management, act like little kids. The place itself isn't too bad, benefits were great, pay was decent. They work you like a dog though."
good,Load and unloaded trucks at a fast but safe pace. Intense physical labor. Only part time. Benefits were great tho. Room for advancement but you to have put in the time.
good,Alle sette si carica il furgone e verso le 9.00 si esce verso la propria zona di competenza con una media 70 consegne.verso le 17 si torna.di nuovo ho imparato a conoscere meglio alcune zone di Roma .i colleghi simpatici e sempre iperattivi.la parte più difficile rispettare le tante consegne.la parte più piacevole lo scherzare avvolte con i colleghi
good,"I am overall satisfied with working with UPS. My coworkers are always upbeat and having a good attitude, helps make the day go along especially in the early mornings. They want to work safe and they strong suggest everyone work safe. I hope to be working with them for years to come."
good,"Main thing to know its not UPS, its a privately owned franchise. but all in all good job to have. loads to learn. if you wanna learn about printing, its a good starting poin"
good,"I was a sorter, so when packages came in I would put them in their correct box, and send them to be shipped out. would often work the conveyer belt. All in all a great learning experience."
good,"I was a seasonal delivery driver helper.  "
good,"I didn't really have this job that long, but for the most part is was an fun job. The people were nice the work was fun. In overall i would go back even though they pay less than what i make now."
good,Working at the UPS store is a good stable job but because of it's size we can easily be understaffed or overstaffed.Overall it's a job that I've enjoyed and has taught me a lot about shipping to different areas and the regulations they enforce.
good,"Physical demanding job but It suited me. I loved my co-workers and supervisors, The pay didn't quite match the work. I stuck around for 9 months simply because of the weekly pay and my co-workers who turned to friends"
good,"Learn while on the job, hit the ground running. Long days, great pay. Uniform included, no weekends, heavy lifting. Great team work, learn all facets of loading and unloading. Meet a lot of co-workers."
good,"Overall, my work experience at The UPS Store was great. It had a really nice working environment and was very low-key. My typical work day would usually began with me opening the store. I would get there at 7 and have everything ready to go by 7:30. I would open the cash registers, organize my work space, get the copiers heated up and any other machines that I would need throughout the day. The two biggest things I've learned at this job is to be a team player and have respect towards your customers and  your co-workers. They both play a vital role in the company. Generally, we didn't have a manager on duty, but we had two store owners that would come in from time to time to check on things at the store and their staff.. They really cared about your needs and try to work around whatever you had going on in your personal life. The best part about working at at the UPS store is because of my co-workers. We were all friends. Some of us went to highschool together. We knew what needed to be done and we got just did it together as a team. The hardest part of the job for me, was trying to communicate with a rude customer and making sure to do whatever you could possibly do to appease them since we didn't have a manager on duty. But, the most enjoyable part of my job, is that I loved the interaction with customers and my co workers. We had regular customers that would come into the store all the time and once you see their car or truck pull up to the store, you knew immediately what they needed help with. I also believe that having such great co-workers made it an easy and fun place"
good,"I liked working there helping customers and co workers, and working in a office environment. It could be stressful at times, and I enjoyed working for UPS."
good,I love the people I worked with and work never failed. Sometimes the boss's weren't on top of things . But it's a great company to work for .
good,A typical would be multitasking paperwork. Doing service tests on employees every hour and updating trailer percentages every half hour and spending time with your employees for at least 5 to 10 minutes at a time. I have learned over 19 years of service that you must earn the resoect of your people in order to get respect of your employees and you must learn to listen to your employees when a problem arises.The upper management is ok. Some of them needs to be trusted and more helpful in advanced placement. Most of my co-workers are great people and fun to be around. the hardest part of the job is maintain consistency of good numbers because it fluctuates depending on the new employees etc. The enjoyable part of the job is being off on the weekends.
good,trabajo de concentracion... aprendi facturacion de paqueteria.
good,"-usually 12-15 hour shifts"
good,"UPS is a good place to work it offers great compensation benefits job security and advancement, all you have to do is be ready to work hard couldnt stress that out enough you have to work hard and in a fast pace environment if you can get over that then you have a solid career."
good,I enjoyed working in a group or being by myself doing label quality. It was also a fun but very busy and fast paced. You need to make your quota or you will hear about it very quickly.
good,"UPS is a good company, but its model is firmly rooted in the traditions of promote from within. By practicing this principle many dynamic young leaders have elected to leave the company. This not only relates to the slow advancement process but the overall compensation provided."
good,"I Actually Like Working Their, Loved The Hours, And I Got To See New Stuff Come In And Get Packed Up. Some Of The Other Workers Were Cool Working Their But Everyone Else Were Annoying"
good,"A typical day at work consist of scanning packages, I learned how to work as a more efficient team also how to handle high volume of work and orders. The current management is bad but I would not put all the blame on the supervisors, the ups company need to update there equipment, my co-woker are excellent people and hard workers."
good,"I enjoyed working at a UPS Store. The owner was kind and intelligent and the employees were motivated. Pay was OK, no benefits."
good,"I think that UPS was a good job, but with it being a seasonal job, I think the company could have being more understanding and willing to work with the schedule of my primary job."
good,"La cultura oranizacional y la disposicion para los nuevos colaboradores es muy buena, se preocupan por la capacitación del personal, la promoción es difícil casi que nula."
good,"Unloading and loading freight via forklift, some heavy lifting, friendly environment, great company to work for but hours are not consistent"
good,"The hours were long, I really got along with the driver I was assigned to. He helped teach me how to organize packages. The opportunity for overtime was offered and the work day was labor intensive. However, I really liked to be outdoors and communicate with the different customers. Overall experience with this company was great."
good,"A typical day for myself includes a high energy and intense operation. I am perfecting the art of handling multiple activities while leading the participating work force to our common goal of being safe, providing quality service to our customer, and remaining within a cost efficient sort span. I work within a very team oriented environment which is the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part of the job is staying positive due to circumstances that can sometimes be outside of your control."
good,"Honestly, i love working for ups. the people and the benefits are great. I love the fact i am in the .union IT has a massive amount of options when it comes to moving up. There are a lots of reasons why i want to leave the company though. First, they don't  pay enough. With it being a part time job. Getting  paid 12.50$ at only 20 to 25 hrs a week, will make any sane person continue to job search. It just is not enough to feed my family. But the benefits are great so it forces you to work 2 jobs. There are plenty options to move up but it goes by seniority. Its nothing more frustrating than being at a workplace for 2 or 3 years and just now seeing full-timers who took 15 to 20 years to get to get that position. I do not want to work two jobs my whole life, I am looking for the ability to put my all effort into one career that can support my family and I."
good,"Ups was a wonderful employer, I would work there again. It was taxing on the body but compensated with longer breaks and occasionally free lunches."
good,Good company to work at it was fast pace and easy. I worked only seasonal time while I was attending High School. Great place if your an active person you'll get your work out there.
good,"Great place to work especially if your looking for part time employment, great benefits package for all employees both full and part time"
good,"Working there kept me busy which was good. The company has a need for their employees to have hands on experience in all parts"
good,"Good Benefits, but long hours, which limits your Work/Life Balance, Physical work, but you are able to be outdoors and not stuck indoors all day"
good,"sorting mail, scanning bar codes,unloading and loading trailers, shrink wrapping pallets"
good,I liked this job because it kept me busy it was rarely ever a time i wasn't doing anything. It was exciting to deliver packages n as well sort them to where they needed to be.
good,Co-workers were helpful at times. Dealt with many complicated customers and issues. Manager and owner were not always very helpful. Would get left alone many times.
good,"Loaded all packages onto truck scan and delivered all packages to correct clients."
good,"It was a lifetime ago and there were so long cold winters but life was decent. I was young, it keep me in shape and I enjoyed my life then."
good,"Dependiendo de la labor que tenga asignada, una día común de trabajo en la empresa es tranquilo."
good,"very quiet but very good pay, I examined medicinal products sitting in a chair looking under a bright light and magnifying glass"
good,all i do is sort packages to different belts according to the sort sheet that i had to memorize of over 50 zip codes. i learned pipe codes and the shipping process. my co-workers are cool not to mush drama or issues with me but notice childish behavior towards each other. the hardest part is just waking up so early in the morning.most enjoyable part is that i can stay to myself do my job and listen to my music.
good,Overall great place to work especially if you are in college. Seniorty based company which make advancement a little difficult/
good,"Could use more organization, that is all I want to say. Management is more concerned about numbers and production and not the people."
good,"Unloading trailers until the volume is done.                                                                                                      I've learned to be a hard worker that's dedicated to getting the job done safely and wright.                                                                                                     Management was okay but could've been better people persons                                                                                                  Keeping up a steady flow once You get in a trailer that is mostly bulk.                                                                                                        The benefits like medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and 401K, and also the pay."
good,"A typical day at work was always different, but some things remained the same.  The reports were done daily, some hourly.  Peak time was from November through Christmas, and was very busy, the rest of the year was pretty simple as long as you knew what you were supposed to do.  It was a great part time job.  You don't really have an opportunity for advancement, unless you want to take the chance of being transferred to different buildings all the time, about every 6 months or sometimes even less time than that."
good,"Management treat employees with respect."
good,Bei Ups muss mann Morgens um 5 Uhr anfangen zu Arbeiten ich habe fünf mal die Woche ca 3 Stunden gearbeitet.Die Arbeit ist Körperlich schwer aber sie wird sehr gut bezahlt.
good,A typical day at work included me unloading thousands of packages and my supervisor telling me which truck to go too next.
good,"I worked at UPS over the winter break as a seasonal job. While the hours were quite taxing and the work was grueling, the pay was above average for town and coworkers were quite helpful if you had problems."
good,Great job but wish I had more hours.  My goal is to promote to driver as soon as I put in more time and prove myself.   UPS is a good company to work for and would like to maintain there until I get full time status.
good,"As you would expect from seasonal work. Hard work, and very limited micro management. Advancement from within. "
good,a very demanding job.  it takes a long time to go full time and they will use you and drop you as they please as a part time cover driver.  You never know your schedule sometimes..  I was working all different hours in he tractor trailer.
good,"Cover different routes for people on vacation or sick leave. "
good,"You meet all sorts of people within walks of life within UPS nothing but degenerates people substance abuse issues and more  all I knew was I need to move and quickly. I'm glad I transferred to Ontario when I did for when I left I heard the majority of an area were all expunged due to being caught red handed with the Apple account which was why apple decided to discontinue their account. This was the very first hub so I decided why not. It's not a bad company though they should be weary of whom they choose to hire. "
good,"Enjoyable work environment. Slow work days, semi-flexible work schedule with low hours. Relaxed management style, not many things got done when needed to."
good,"Los dias de trabajo solian ser duros sobretodo en el turno de noche,aprendi a trabajar en equipo y en armonia con mis compañeros,la parte mas dificil aguantar el trato de los supervisores,lo mejor que todos los 28 de cada mes tenias tu sueldo ingresado"
good,"This location is based inside of a convention hotel and the work day will depend on the conference groups the hotel brings in and the needs of said conference group. "
good,"A typical day is not entirely bad, after a few weeks of being promoted is almost like being thrown into the wild and expecting to out run a cheetah. After a few months it starts to get a little easier but the overwhelmingness of never having enough people and the union is obviously against management. It also has a negative moral rating against management. If i had to sum up my experience i would say ""Over paid cheerleaders"" only because we take credit for a lot but don't really do anything"
good,hard working area need to be quick with your hands in order to place packages in right orders. the most enjoyable thing was the good co-workers made the hours go by fast made it easier that they were hard workers as well.
good,I worked the night shifts at UPS at Logan Airport. It was hard work but helped me to learn about the freight industry and how it all works.
good,"We had a methodical way of delivering packages on a bicycle, it was fun and competitive.Safety is innate. I enjoyed being outside, meeting new people, and meeting deadlines."
good,They put their managers through a good training program to insure they understood how to run their operations.  Help you understand how to work in a union environment.
good,The more you did the more responsibilities was added to your work load. work home life  not very balanced. Co-workers was very enjoyable to work with.
good,Loaded packages onto delivery trucks on a daily basis that went out for delivery to residential homes and businesses. Had to assist delivery personnel in loading packages for more efficient delivery.
good,"A company that operates around the clock.  You are expected to put in 10+ hour work days, and work 6-7 days a week in December.  It has a good compensation package and pension, but the trade-off is the hours required and once you work on a particular shift (especially the night shifts) it is hard to move to another.  Hard work is required and if you don't wish to work extremely hard it is not the company for you.  They promote almost exclusively from within so growth is definitely available of you prove skilled and ambitious."
good,While working there I learned a lot of new and exciting things. The teaching was excellent as they spent quality time teaching me and they and I enjoyed it. It was a Temporary positon with no room for advancement.
good,its was an easy layed back job with lots of free time to clean or do mail. the co workers were awesome but they also cause problems with costumers that could have been resolved easily. the hardest part of the job was waiting for costumers to sow up there was days when i would sit down and not do anything.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. It can be challenging, but you are well compensated for the time and energy that you put in. The management team is excellent and they truly want you to succeed."
good,"Walk inside greet everyone sign in to get badge to have access through the warehouse."
good,"Inbound incoming packages to our internal tracking system."
good,Work was easy (for me) and very fast paced. I was on call so i did not have a set schedule which didn't work well as a part time job.
good,"Not a bad place to work.  The job is very physical, the benefits are not that great.  Part time employees don't qualify for benefits until a year. The $12"
good,"I have developed very strong communication skills as I learned very quickly that building relationships with your customers gains trust and can earn valuable business.  I learned how to be a strong leader for my staff, teaching and developing a strong team in order for us to succeed and reach our sales goals.  The hardest part of my job was that work never ended.  I was working 24/7, at home, when baby was sleeping and at the office."
good,"Good place to work in general. Managers are great and very understanding. "
good,I worked there as a temp and worked very hard to learn Excel 2.0 (wow) The job culture was very professional but friendly too. Strong division between management and union workers.
good,worked my way from moving packages to dispatch in a relatively short period of time. lots of room for growth. overall employees were happy with a good demeanor.
good,I enjoy driving the trucks and delivering parcels to waiting clients.UPS is a very safety conscientious company with a great program to increase your safe driving techniques.
good,"The hardest part of working at United Parcel Service(UPS) is that there is little to no teamwork. Co-workers there only care about themselves and on top of that most of the people who work there can't seem to even handle the simple job tasks. I consider myself as one of the hardest workers in the building. I show up to work every single day, never call in, and give it my all every single day. There are only a handful of employees that work there that I can say do the same thing. That is probably what makes working at UPS so stressful and difficult"
good,"A typical day at work is moving packages at a rate of 1200 per hour (a parcel in and out of your hands in three seconds or less) in a warehouse that is normally 100 degrees. When I got this job I learned a lot about what hard work looks like, I see the need for a goal and a vision for a whole team to follow and learned that every one is counted on for a reason. Management at times can be unreasonable with goals and more time than not unappreciative, it depends greatly on who your supervision/manager is but most will try to guilt you about personal life issues, the advantage of the company is that there is a union that helps mediate issues and is essentially the ""voice of reason"" the hardest part of the job is there is no schedule you have a start time but no actual down time, more days than not they will call a down time and you will not leave until an hour later so it makes scheduling around this job very difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the friendship, hard work brings out the best in people more times than not and I have made some very great friends and had many great experiences."
good,"Si inizia a lavorare alle 7 come tutti i corrieri, riesci a fermarti una mezz'ora/ un'ora per poter mangiare.si finisce di scaricare per le 18."
good,"provided full training and team work experience, plus a fair pay, opportunity to work and communicate close to low enforcement agencies such as Edmonton Police Department ."
good,It's hard work and takes a lot of patience. There's lots of gossip. It's better to work the morning shift than the night or twilight shift.
good,Start off my day lining up my truck. In this job field learning is a everyday event. Management was quite well. Co-workers hype u up. making u leave with a smile.weather makes the job difficult. returning my delivery truck comes back empty
good,"Supervisors like to send people home and make the very little people we have do all the work.  Supervisors really take their employees for granted.  Some co-workers are very non-productive and un-interactive when it comes to their work duty.  The hardest part of the job is actually maintaining job performance depending on the work flow.  The only enjoyable thing I see about this job is that you get paid weekly and you get a good number of your vacations (depending on how many years you worked there for).  What I learned is that you have to be consistent and time your decision precisely on the situation, if not, then you'll be behind with your work."
good,"I worked at UPS for 4 years, in the 4 years I was there I seem good people go out the door and bad people stay. You know the ones that want come to work and when they do, they don't do any work."
good,"UPS has been a very beneficial place to work. I have improved both my skill both in the logistics field as well as customer support/service field."
good,UPS is a good company to work for. The benefits are the best overall. Management isn't that great but it is compensated with a work life balance. They are very flexible with schedules. The pay is ok depending on experience. But overall a good company to work for.
good,"As a part time manager i received health insurance, multiple discounts on cellphone etc, and tuition assistance. Pay is above average, however advancement opportunities are limited for part time employees."
good,"Helped me horne my training and management skills to the maximum. "
good,GO GO GO. That is their flow of the day. As for full time employment be prepared to wait and deal with multiply managers. If they all like you then you are in but if one doesn't care for you then you will be waiting or not working at all.
good,learned alot there. could of had more time off. could of had better pay rate for different shifts. trained people and worked really hard for 10+ hours
good,"Ups is hard work but if you are willing to deal with low pay and tough conditions for a year, your benefits kick in and you start getting raises and vacations."
good,"I worked packing trucks, the work was hard and there was no life outside work, but the benefits were amazing. You work mostly by yourself. management and the workers are very seperated."
good,"There's no such thing as a typical night at work. It's always a surprise. The idea is to go in and complete your job as smoothly as possible. Job areas vary widely. Management lately has gone downhill; very poor communication and nobody seems to really know what is going on. Part time management gets the blunt of that hit. When they aren't well informed, then neither are the employees. Everyone otherwise works relatively well together in order to get the job done at the end of the night. The goal is to get the job done on time and get home safely. The most enjoyable part of the job is the actual operation itself. If management isn't demeaning you at the moment, you can actually feel like you make a difference in your work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult employees with negative attitudes. Negativity flows from the top down. Sometimes its hard to be the stopper between full time management and employees."
good,Managed 25 employees on daily basis as a supervisor in warehouse shipping. Hardest part of job was keeping employees and getting to come to work. I did enjoy my co-workers.
good,"To work there is good because they close on Sunday, and close by 7 PM on business days.  The workday is slow and boring, since they just basically pack and ship items for UPS and other shipping methods."
good,"It is a great place to work however it takes some time to move up in the company, and you have to wait because it goes by seniority. it's not easy to get a driver position because most of them are steady in their routes."
good,"I worked at UPS as a seasonal worker handling packages and stacking them into aircraft containers to be shipped via airplane."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me getting to work about 10 minuets early in order to get my work station set up, which involved me getting my computer turned on and logged in. Then I would go around to collect supplies needed and if I needed to find materials go look for them wherever they could possibly be. By the time I got back, say around 10 to 20 minuets, I would get everything ready to go for the work day. I would then check my emails to see if any customers or upper management had certain boxes to process in which case if they weren't brought to me I would have to go get them and process whatever needed to be done with them, address correction, new address, bad label, missing label, etc, and get them out as soon as possible. By now my other employees would have shown up (later start times) and would assist them if they needed help with their work. If they had any questions I would also help them provide the answers to questions or problems they couldn't fix. The hardest part about my job is dealing with management who never really made an effort to supervise my area therefore we had to be self sufficient. Which also made it the most enjoyable part of my job because our area ran under cost with no supervision and few complaints in 8 years of service."
good,"I am currently a part time supervisor at UPS and have been working for this company for 19+ years. UPS helped pay for my college tuition, I have excellent benefits and I have 4 weeks of paid vacation as a part time employee. It's a very challenging company and you work very hard for your money."
good,It was a temp job doing the holidays so I would ride around with the UPS driver and deliver packages to stores and peoples house and we would work longer hours then usual.
good,"it is pretty much a free gym member ship. this job gives you a daily full body workout with lifting, bending, twisting, and squatting."
good,I loved all the challenges brought to me with this company.  It was too bad that they couldn't free up a full time position for me when I needed it.
good,"Working at UPS was a pretty cool experience. Describing a typical day at work is as simple as saying, I rode passenger side in a delivery truck all day and dropped packages off at different customer's homes. There wasn't much that I really learned at this job however I was able to build heavily upon my skill of organization. I was always required to organize the packages in the back of the truck in order for the deliveries to run smoothly.  The hardest part about the job was the fact that it was hours and hours of me doing the same exact thing everyday and driving the same route. There were parts about the job that became old and boring. However there were also some enjoyable aspects of the job such as interacting with different customers and listening to the different stories that they would tell. There would also be times where customers would like to show-off with different things such as their cars and homes these were the most enjoyable parts about working at UPS."
good,"Could be some tough physical work but you should know that before you even get into it. Easy and mindless work and a great in between job, you more or less get paid to work out."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of gathering, organizing, and delivering parcels to residents and businesses. I learned organization planning allows day to be successful. The management was helpful and well versed in their positions. My co-workers were fabulous, funny, smart, and helpful. The hardest part of my job was walking 1 square mile uphill in the rain and snow in December delivering parcels with a garden cart. The most enjoyable part of my job was delivering gifts from family to family and seeing the delight on the receipients faces."
good,"management skills"
good,I Set up trucks for co-workers to load packages that I sort until the end of the day. Then I help clean up trucks and lift irregular and overweight packages into their proper destination.
good,"Working as a temporary driver helper wasn't too bad, but I needed a second job which wasn't a problem due to early hours. However, if the weather was bad, it made the day seem longer."
good,enjoyed my time there just didnt get great hrs it was only part time. but enjoyed my co-workers an the job. leaned alot an became a trainer.
good,"A typical shift was 4-6 hours of pretty steady labor, loading and unloading containers on to and off of various types of aircraft. My supervisor was great. Tuition assistance is available for 3rd shift employees. It is a very physical job as you will be constantly pushing and pulling containers that are often in excess of 5000 lbs."
good,UPS is a very great company to work for. It is a very demanding company and you will have to devote a lot of time away from family to excel.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. At times my back starts to hurt and  the shift seems to drag besides that I like it but I wish i was getting more hours as a part-time employee.
good,"In short you can expect a fast paced, hi impact day, with the goal of getting your job done so the drivers can do theirs.You are always moving with little downtime so the shifts seem to move by fast."
good,"Fun job. Takes up alot of time during the week, but you make enough money to make up for that on the weekend.  Just put your head down, and work, and you'll be just fine.  Not rocket science, but it is hard work."
good,"I worked the overnight shift it generally started around 12 a.m., and we would end around 9 a.m. Co-workers we're great, the management wasn't the best, the hardest parts of the job we're adjusting to the overnight shift, but it was easy once you we're used to it."
good,"I worked at UPS for 6 years and it had its ups and downs.  A typical day would be dealing with employees that sometimes felt like working and some that did not feel like working.  I learned how to get around Augusta, Georgia.  I also learned how to multitask a lot better and be more productive with time management.  My co-workers were okay.  I had a few that were really lazy and was just there to take up space.  Then I had some that were super hard working just like myself.  My hardest part of the job was making sure my employees were loading the correct package on the correct truck.  The most enjoyable part of the job.......nevermind, there was no enjoyable part of the job because the place was so unorganized and had super favoritism to certain employees."
good,"a typical day at the Preload would be going in at 2 a.m or 12 a.m depending on the day and loading boxes of all sizes and different weight into trucks and organizing them by a certain deadline "
good,"UPS is a good place to work for its fast paced so your always moving around and have something to do. Great career to move up in, everyone is down to earth and friendly, management is good only problem is job security sometimes if work slows down you will be let go."
good,UPS is steadily growing the Canadian market. It is a great company for younger persons starting their career. You can work long hours and be well compensated. Unionized environment provides employees with good benefits.
good,"- Fast past environment."
good,"Drivers phoned me weekly and stated the meeting point. Typical day included riding with the driver, scanning packages out, and occasionally in the truck for returns. I would have liked to advance with the company, however I have not discovered another opportunity after the seasonal position I was offered."
good,"UPS is an excellent company with many great benefits.  Many employees have made UPS their career of choice and have worked there for over 30 years.  A typical day at work includes job set up, preparation for the work day, unloading and loading parcels in trailers for different destinations.  Addressing operational and employee issues throughout the work day and finally wrap up and preparation for the next day.  My co-workers and management team are outstanding and work hard each day to deliver on time to our customers."
good,"Team Member"
good,"I would load 3000 packages in a typical night.  The packages would range from 5lbs to 150lbs.  This job gave me what I needed for the time being.  I worked at night, that made me a zombie.  hardest part of the job was getting up at 10:00pm to go to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with my coworkers."
good,"UPS is a dependable employer who has many benefits to reap from while working for them. As a supervisor, your typical work day consists of arriving to work ahead of time to prepare your area for the  day to come.Preparing paperwork and ensuring that the equipment needed to have a successful business day is critical. It's very fast paced all while requiring sound judgement be made in order to operate smoothly and not cost the company any extra money, but rather save money. I've learned to keep an eye out for extremely small details inquiring trailer numbers so that way there are no costly mistakes to be made. The management is smooth for the most part; however, there is a problem within higher management and their communication abilities. My co-workers are extremely dedicated and determined to make the day theirs each any every single time they enter the facility. The hardest part of the job is adapting to each situation on a daily basis and finding a different approach to motivate the employees to work harder as each hour passes on. The most enjoyable aspect is knowing that you are helping citizens across the country in receiving their purchased goods that they worked for or so happen to get due to holidays, birthdays, or any given celebration."
good,"the work was not too stressful"
good,"I have learned alot from my my time spent here. I have learned to give instructions and take them. They also paid for a majority of my school Tuition. Great Place to work while going to school. As far as career wise, there are better places"
good,"UPS Stores do so much with coordinating not only there own social media landscape, but for others as well. This job has been a real boon in regards to cutting my teeth."
good,"Once you get into a set routine, it is an easy place to work. People are typically friendly and some do what is expected of them. Hardest part of the job is the heavy workflow and inconsistency of the workers."
good,I like working at ups but i got tried of them tell me to come in and they don't have no work for me  i love doing my job i had a lot of respect for my co workers and manager
good,"Working at The UPS Store is busy busy busy! Every day is different and anything can be expected. It's not just a place to ship packages, we do everything from helping you print an e-mail to putting together your wedding invitations.  There is no typical day, and every single one is a learning experience. I really enjoy the variety. The atmosphere is usually light and fun. It's a great, drama free work environment. We all work together to  get the job(s) done. The owners are good people to work for.  They understand the importance of morale and helped increase that by having a stereo system put in. It's awesome. The work isn't hard per se, it's just abundant."
good,Worked as package handler at the Bellingham UPS. Schedule was 5:30 until completion of the day. This schedule was ideal while I was finishing college. Worked loading packages into delivery trucks. Passed zip code test that allowed a raise as well as more job responsibilities. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the fast paced environment.
good,You get there either really early in the morning or late at night and stay around 8-10 hours if you want to. In winter though you may only be there for 4 hours because of seniority. The place is open air so working in -10 degree weather is not very fun.
good,"UPS was a great place to work, flexible hours, the workers were helpful to one another as well as friendly, never bored it was always busy and challenging."
good,"Open and close the store, daily reconciliation, cash handling, and bank deposits. Sort mail; enter received packages into the database. Enter customer information accurately into computer programs for domestic and international shipping. Resolve customer concerns and questions through email and phone. Notarize Real Estate, Power of Attorney, and Passport documents."
good,"I personally was okay with the company. The work is easy enough to learn and is a great way to stay in shape. The co-workers are diverse in every sense of the word. The only way you will do badly is if you act badly (e. g. showing up late and not calling in)."
good,"I enjoyed this company very much, especially the people I worked with.  Most are still my friends to this day.  I learned a lot and it helped hone my customer service skills on a daily basis."
good,"I myself, am a superior athletic person. What does this have to do with UPS Package Handling? Everything. If you're strong, you will enjoy this job because it is physically demanding. If you're not in good shape, you will want to quit. The people are great. They treat you nice. Any concerns you have, they will resolve them as soon as possible."
good,Busy days and nights. I learned a lot of management skills. The management was ok. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was there is not a lot of room for advancement.
good,Very competitive benefits and pay. Would definately recommend this.
good,Typical day at UPS was productive and worthy. I learned to supervise a small group of individuals that was easy to work with. Management was excellent simply because they were all about production and trying to improve the company. My co-workers were awesome all because we had that will to work and get the job done quickly and safely. The hardest part of the job was having to work in all types of weather at times. The enjoyable part about the job was that you were able to win UPS merchandise.
good,It seemed liked there was always something new to learn every day.  When you book a same day shipment you have several ways to book that shipment and each way came with it's own positives and negatives.  But I loved to learn new things and track down lost packages.
good,assisting the driver of UPS with package delivery. long hours some heavy lifting required
good,Great Company structured processes and procedures stabile work environment.
good,"Everyday hold stressful events."
good,"enjoyed working for ups, the work was hard, but nonetheless it was a good work experiance. the hours weren't all that great anywhere from 2:30 am - 4 am start time usually clocked out between 8-9 am"
good,"A typical day at work consists of heavily sweating constant need for hydration, fast pace, hot tempers, and no breaks. Management was okay until they often get angry at certain things. Co-workers look out for one another at times and at other times they are at each others throat. The hardest part of the job is staying humble and level headed in those harsh conditions. But one can get through it. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home daily tired!"
good,"Supervisor abuse their power"
good,expect to work hard but its worth it. a great company to be with. my only real gripe is its an open dock and advancement is limited. will not hire as a full time associate unless you get a CDL and there is mandatory union enrollment.
good,"This was a great job that I loved I just hated being the barer of bad news often times when I had to tell a customer that their product didn't fall under warranty due to one aspect or another so we could not replace the item.  I enjoyed working with others, taking calls and helping solve problems on a daily basis."
good,This was a great learning experience seeing how hard it is for the drivers on a day to day basic and was able to learn how they work.
good,"My nightly routine includes of course the operation, payroll, employee management, training, discipline( if necessary), etc. Over a good place to work just really hard to advance. The company still has a old school approach to young management."
good,"I worked through an agency. They sent me to UPS first and I really enjoyed it. My fellow employees were very friendly and I felt welcomed right from the start. Everyday I was doing a different task. We all worked together as a team. One day I was putting gift sets together and the next I was setting up displays for the stores."
good,"I only worked during holiday peak season. It was very fast paced and occasionally extremely difficult. I was a overnight loader. Typically you go in for a shift ranging from midnight to 1am and leave around 9:30 or 10am the latest. Co-workers are generally friendly, management was efficient and helpful. The hardest part of the job for me was fitting all the packages into the truck while also catching work off the belt, mostly because I was not used to the rapid pace.  The pay was very nice on the positive side and you always get weekends off."
good,"Great Company to work for and obtain a career path."
good,I would charge customers for shipping with us. The hardest part of the job was going at a fast speed to pick out certain packages to charge a fee with.
good,"Worked in the Revenue Recover Department, auditing packages for weight corrections.  Lifting and Lowering packages weighing between 5 - 100 lbs. to check for proper charge and size requirements."
good,Random levels of work would occur. Pretty cold but warm up instantly. Easy shift to handle.
good,"UPS never game me any problems. worked with great people."
good,"You will be on the road for many hours of the day If you are working in the van with roughly a 30 minute break, its a fast paced job in any department."
good,Most important job was forecasting all requirements for peak season operations In addition to time study and performance analysis.
good,"Pretty good experience, your out everyday and the day flies by."
good,"Worked the day shift, my boss was awesome but the next shifts leader was really lazy. We would be backed up and he would just stand there. On top of it, morning shifts couldn't even do basic stacking so it made the whole system harder than it needed to be. Really wish either or both got warnings."
good,A typical day at UPS would consist of our meeting and finding out what time the plane would arrive and depart.  Then we would go get our equipment and enjoy our downtown until its time to load the plane up
good,The benefits barely outweigh the high demands and stress of the job.
good,I contact and maintain a close relationship with UPS account in the New Jersey/Chesapeake area.  I make sure that each account is meeting the volume expectations initially required as well as aligning myself with any needs or concerns the account may have.  I make sure the current UPS technology system being used is functioning properly as well as recommending and logistical changes which may improve their packaging process.
good,"my co- workers was great , decent work life balance ,great benefits"
good,"Productive, Safety, Mental and physical job. Always working as a team."
good,"Riding around in a truck all day dropping packages. It was quite hectic during the holiday rush, but UPS is a very organized company and they run a very tight ship."
good,UPS is a great company with great befits and potential for personal growth within the company. Must be able to be quick on your feet and pay good attention to detail.
good,Weather was tough at times being in the cold an heat but I did my job very well
good,"working for ups was a life changer for me. it was my first job ,a typical day at ups as a sort/bagger was very demanding and challenging but I was always up for the task ,as a sorter I would be the primary worker whos job was to sort out the mail and packages into the designated area and my when im a bagger my would be to bag up the mail and ensure that all packages that are in the bag belongs in that area.. working there I have learn how work as a team and as a team leader.."
good,"This was a temporary position in which I worked the early shift, 3:00am-11:00am."
good,You feel whatever the weather outside is all the time. You are constantly lifting and loading packages all day long and breaks are only 10 minutes but your work day is usually no longer than 4 hours unless it's peak season.
good,"very demanding project goals, motivation to excel in this company"
good,"Compensates well. lots of advancement potential, varied shifts available, hectic and long hours during holiday season"
good,"Fast paced, dirty work, attention to detail & organization. sequential detail for loading and unloading."
good,"Audits, Communicating with drivers, Customer service, communicating with my counterparts, PCIS ( messages and concerns that come to our center), computer and paperwork. "
good,"Helping driver achieve their goals through coaching, training and encouragement."
good,A typical day at UPS includes a fast pace environment which includes unloading trucks onto a conveyor belt in a timely fashion.
good,Supervised employees for proper & accurate loading of packages to their correct destination while maintaining a safe workplace.
good,"a typical day at work is scanning every package that comes threw the warehouse for tracking purposes then sorting them, and shipping them out to there destinations. my co-workers are friendly and take there jobs very seriously. the hardest part of the job is probably the constant repetition of doing the same thing over and over again, however"
good,"its a union company good place to work, co worker are always in a bad mood due to management"
good,"i worked the twilight shift which was mon-fri, 5-10/11.  because of the hours and days worked, i found it very difficult to keep up with my school work.  however, i often found myself going to work and sleeping through classes.  one thing i loved about the job was that it could be unpredictable.  often times, it seemed monotonous, and overwhelming, but there were glints of hope that could come at any time"
good,UPS is a very fast paced demanding environment.  The experience that you gain from working there is priceless.
good,"The UPS store is an excellent learning experience, and also a great way to pick up great customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people from different walks of life. I've met people from all over the world which has helped me to broaden my horizons. I work with really professional and outstanding people which makes my job more enjoyable. My day to day at work is packing,shipping and assisting customers whether its compaints or compliments. The most enjoyable part is seeing a cutomer leave with a smile on their face, thats the highlight of my day."
good,"When in a managment role there is a great deal of relocation."
good,enjoyed working closely with the drivers. I liked the hours the most. I had a small baby when I started there so it meant alot to be able to work part time and get benefits also.
good,I really enjoyed what i did for a number of years but that place really just depends on who the full timer on duty is. It seemed like they were always switching management up. Plus the way you are treated there sometimes is really belittling.
good,On a typical day of work i package items and send them out. Had to consolidate and organize mail. Also had to provide printing and binding services. worked well with co workers functioned as a team.
good,"One day at work I learn about problem solving, an event was being planned by the rest of the team and there were not enough funds to reinsure that the event will occur, the rest of the workers helped to make fundraising events and it helped the event."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of meeting my driver somewhere local to me and working late. I enjoyed the job though my co worker was a great guy and very willing to teach me anything I did not know or answer any questions I had. My favorite part  of the job was getting my hustle on to deliver my packages in a timely manor and watching the smiles on the faces of the customers that were home when we came through, it was really cool. The only hard part of the job was probably the back of the truck during the peak season but that was really more of an overwhelming feeling then anything and as long as you could get over it you were good to go."
good,"I've learned a lot about transportation logistics, very laid back environment"
good,I worked for UPS for a little under 4 months and the hours working there were ridiculous. I generally worked everyday in-between 3 am and 9 am and was required to work quickly and efficiently.
good,"My title let me explore outside the facility, I had a fun time working there."
good,"Worked nights. Fast paced, required reading and accuracy for sorting procedures. shifts fly by because your always busy."
good,"well i sign in, grab my scanner, go to my trunk and start loading boxes."
good,Its a part time job loading and unloading sorting packages its a good student job great pay if your there long enough great benefits its union job
good,This job is great to have if you are looking to get experience.
good,"Typical day at work  - very busy."
good,"This was a good company to work for, however they did not provide you with sufficient training to complete some aspects of the job. The hardest part of the job was international shipping laws and regulations. The most enjoyable part was, working with the public. I learned a lot about packing and shipping a variety of packages.W"
good,9 - 5 everyday and nothing more.
good,"A difficult position within the Twilight sort (heavy flow along with extensive hours). Pay is good, but advancement possibilities are hindered by the fact that employees who have been with the company for almost 15 years are still waiting for an open spot. Progression within the company involves losing union safety-net to become a supervisor, and even then it is only a part-time position. If patient and willing to endure, then this job might be good for you. If you are aspiring and looking for an in-the-long-run career, look elsewhere; this particular position offers hardly any skills to utilize in another field."
good,For the past 30+ years I worked as a delivery driver and a tractor-trailer driver.
good,Hours are awful. No work/Life Balance. Hard to move up in the company from a management level.
good,"A typical day at work includes packing and shipping items, making copies, sending faxes, and communicating with hundreds of customers. I learned that not everyone can be pleased. I also learned that I work too hard, sometimes picking up the slack from other coworkers. Management isn't the finest, but it's not the worst. My coworkers are like family members, we go out together, we attend each other's events, we buy each other Christmas presents. The hardest part of the job is knowing how hard I work, especially for a job that doesn't require hard work. I take my job seriously, and it ends up hurting me. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can take a vacation without my manager disapproving. I also like the flexibility of hours (my manager takes my school schedule into consideration when making the work schedule)."
good,"A typical day in my position involves about an hour of checking and responding to emails, three to four hours of paperwork, three to four hours of supervising operations, and wrapping up with one to two hours of nightly paperwork."
good,"I think that U.P.S. is a decent place to work. A typical day at work would be me starting to unload a short/long trailer until I am done. Then while waiting on my next trailer I would re-tape packages, or help someone else. I have learned various warehouse work skills from working at U.P.S.. My coworkers are very friendly and easy to get alone with. The hardest part of the job is to life packages 100+ pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a partner to unload a trailer"
good,"Although this was a part time job, I often worked 40hrs a week working a double one shift in the morning and in the evening. Yet these hours were in consitant each week."
good,"Starting pay was 8.50/hour, way too low for the work performed. Only worth it if you need health benefits or educational reimbursement. High turnover, most people can't handle the job, or realize it isn't worth breaking your back every day to get a 100-200 dollar check at the end of the week."
good,UPS has been a good company to work for over the past five years as I have worked there throughout college and now I have become a part-time supervisor. The only downside to working at UPS is the hours are not the greatest and is hard to balance other parts of your life at times.
good,"career opportunities, good pay and benefits. fun workplace, room for advancement"
good,"On a typical day I lead a staff of 4 employees. We provide shipping services, computer services, copier services, mailbox services,notary services and bank services for USAA members. At the Ups Store, we accept packages and mail for our mailbox holders. I interact with employees from UPS, FED EX, USPS, DHL and other freight carriers daily. We thrive to provide world class customer service to our customers everyday."
good,UPS is a beautiful place to work. It's to bad I was not hired on full-time.
good,"this is not an ""easy"" job as many may seem. hourly work is demading and management role is both physically and mentaly challenging as well."
good,"Job was OK the work was hard at times,some heavy lifting,the peole I worked with were good , got along well with them,management was good had no problems with them or they with me."
good,one of the easiest toughest jobs Ive ever had.... one thing i always had fun. ( in a safe way )
good,"super busy,ran hard once we got out on street,good pay,worked well with customers"
good,I have been at UPS for 13 years in March. It is usually loud yet friendly atmosphere.
good,They started you off at low pay and that all you do is load or unload trucks
good,12 hours is a typical day at UPS
good,"Day: Goes fast, as there is always plenty to do. Steady if not slammed all day long."
good,"Working on my own and making decisions. Handling all my accounts and preparing quotes for new and renewal accounts, handling all phone messages and calls for my 4 bosses everyday while they were out selling the business."
good,there is always work to be done a lot of bending and stress on the body but the co-workers make the time go by
good,I was a seasonal employee so this was a perfect match. I did not receive management too well because at times they seemed unsure of tasks and daily direction and goals.
good,"Long hours, but good pay. It is definitly a mans job. Heavy lifting required, fast paced. Great benifits, but you work for them. Supervision can get crabby often. They push you to your extreme limits."
good,UPS is a decent job great pay they make you work hard but that is good i never mind working hard especially when the pay or health care benefits are that good
good,Was a good place to work and learned skills I will be able to use as I look for a career.
good,I have learned on my previous job to manage 10 employees. I learned to be a team-player and communication with co-workers and employees is the key. The hardest part of my job I would say is not enough work is distributed. The most enjoyable part is to have a great working relationship with my co-workers and employees.
good,"Long hours, fast paced and often stressful work environment in a very competitive industry."
good,"Load and unload trucks. we got one 15 minute break which i used to drink a lot of water. hardest part of the job loading truck, the best was unloading its just easier to unload."
good,a typical day is constent movement fast track place.it is a great start for some one thats looking for part time work
good,"Good culture, hard working environment,no job Security any more"
good,"Good pay, but no balance of work & family due to the excessive hours"
good,"management over worried about numbers, little or no advancement but if you do your job you are left alone, union won't let anybody get fired even those who need to be(late to work or just don't show up, and don't care about the work)"
good,"A typical day starts reviewing reports, staff meeting, planning and preparing for your workgroup to arrive. l UPS is a fast-paced work environment with many elements that make up the job. There's training, auditing, safety, managing, working within the scope of a contract and many others."
good,UPS treated me very fair and with respect. Management was very experienced. Working with the union employees was very difficult. Most of them regularly refused to do the work they were instructed to do.
good,"Other than the low pay and low motivation towards the end, the company was a place of growth and skill development."
good,"a typical day at work, you never know what to expect. My first few months there i learned many things, loading and unloading feeders and containers, shifting, pulling cans up and many other useful things. my co-workers where very honest and hard working individuals, as well very enjoyable they made the day go by faster. i loved being on the CHSP team, i feel safety should always be a key ."
good,"it's a nice job , nice and steady. the hardest part of job was during peak season which was another December since a lot of customers would ship around Christmas and we will work around 7 hours a day and it was great a lot of overtime but we will still have a 10 minute break which was really hard."
good,"It was supposed to be a part-time position, but you always worked eight-hour shifts. I learned a lot about people and how to manage a line. My co-workers were easy-going. I had trouble reaching a lot of things that were up high, but overall I enjoyed the learning experience the job gave me. I had to be there at 2:30 most mornings, unless there was a meeting scheduled then we'd have to be there before that."
good,A typical day had consisted of helping customers send packages. I had learned about the shipping business and all the hard work that is put into this line of work. Management was a little hard to work with. The hardest part about the job was getting the dimensions correct for customers shipments. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility of hours.
good,1 - Pre meeting with daily updates for the day
good,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal driver. It was extremely difficult work for the first week or two. Then I was give a ""helper"". we delivered the same number of package that I had been delivering by myself."
good,Loved it there just wish I could have been full time there. Co workers were great though.
good,Every day I would be excited to greet new faces and help them with their needs. I learned how to be patient and that customers are always right. i also learned how to multitask and give instructions. The harder\st part of the day wikll ahve to be after lunch i would have three more hours left and it was the slowest work hours because business would be slow.
good,I learn a lot from this job but the most important is that I learn how to do things in a fast pace and to use a lot of thinking skills.
good,Package handler for the small sort. Union job benefits are awesome if you don't mind workign hard.
good,i like the fact that it was a fast pace and that i got a good work out well working. my co-worker were helpful when it came time to lift something over weight and i got along with all of them
good,Good company to work for very well managed! but little chance of becoming permanent due it being a short term position would love to work for this company in a full-time roll
good,Is a cool place to work. I like the job security. I like that i'm helping to make the custumer happy.
good,I would recommend this job to someone if they are looking to be a full time driver. The pay is good but it's hard work. The benefits are good but try not to get hurt.
good,"Basically I just loaded stuff until the end of the day, with only a 10 minute break on a 3 hour work day. I learned how to load boxes neatly into a truck and some communication skills and teamwork."
good,Fast and easy job to work part-time. I learned to work with different managers with different managerial strategies. Trained for every section was very helpful when we are short-staffed.
good,My position with this company is seasonal and with the season ending I'm looking for a permanent position to help build a company and my career at the same time.
good,"Works with the drivers to delver packages to customers. You are responsible for loading and unloading the truck, interacting with the customers, and filling out paperwork to record deliveries."
good,It was good to help people get there packages and in good shape.. it wasn’t really nothing hard about the job i really enjoyed working there and i learned a lot on the job
good,"Très bonne entreprise esprit à l'américaine, possibilité d évolution en interne. Liberté sur l'organisation du travail tournées."
good,Sometimes allergy work don't end up on your check especially the overtime when you try to tell him about they have to verify it and their way verifying it is they don't keep track . They tell the driver to write it down or just write down only show it to them that's her only proof . Either way somehow they work around it and it's like you never worked overtime
good,"I've been with this company going on 6 years, and I have worked at a few different locations, and every experience has been a good one so far. Every job has it's challenges, but the good definitely outweighs the bad here."
good,At UPS you get paid to work out with benefits after your probation period with the ability to make a real career. They will pay you to go to college on their dime with the chance to move and grow in any field that you can think of. Anything can be obtained though UPS with the right mindset and hard work.
good,"A typical Night At work I would say was more like 4 to 6 hours in the gym.  You are constantly moving lifting boxes loading trucks and unloading them.  You got to be on a fast but safe paced, the culture is great felt very comfortable around my fellow co-workers. there are nights we finished early n there were nights it felt like it was forever but we pull thru. the hardest part of the job is trying to get finish on time unloading n loading trucks.  The most enjoyable part of the job I must say was the friends and people u meet at the job."
good,UPS embodies hard work and dedication. It takes courage and a positive mindset to be a package handler. I also recommend following all the safety guidelines to prevent injuries due to lack of awareness.
good,The job itself isn’t easy and it does take a lot of physical work but once you get the hang of it it’s pretty simple. I would say the only thing bad about it is that you work for a decent amount of hours and sometimes you work longer then expected.
good,"its was a good company to work for and was productive, although management at the time was very poor and they treated the picking department more unfairly than others."
good,"Well paid"
good,Working for Ups as a driver helper requires a great amount of energy and flexibility. Patience is also required as there are many obstacles in a days work.
good,"As an OMS supervisor, you are provided the opportunity to partner with other management and non-management associates for an efficient and quick resolution for all customers."
good,I learned a lot but I also struggled somewhat as well. It was a good job with good benefits but it didn't fit my schedule. I wanted to be home more at night.
good,"Work safe and slow, ups tries to get more out of you then someties possible.work at athe safety of yourself and others ate priority safe pace and make sure your s"
good,Working on my long year in June 2020. Its been very interesting. I have met some very unusual people but likable. The year has been filled with ups and downs( pun not intended). But because of the diversity it is different maybe even entertaining you have to be there.
good,"I just come and take boxes off the truck. It get difficult sometimes with the heavy boxes but it’s a simple job. Pick it up, put it on the belt. LABELS UP."
good,"Ansich ist UPS ein super Arbeitgeber und ich wäre auch super gern nach der Elternzeit zurück gegangen aber dies ist leider nicht möglich...."
good,"I was always wants to work for the company now and the future but never been noticed as an employee ."
good,"Work day involved staying in a trailer and building walls of packages floor to ceiling securely until it was full think tetris, 15 minute break for lunch, had excellent benefits, pto and non pto, federal holidays off some were paid, good job for those wanting exercise or working through college."
good,"Overall, the quality of the workplace environment was fairly good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with tough customers but because of this, I was able to learn new skills to deal with this. The management is very friendly and very open. A typical day at work at this ups store would consist of helping customers drop off their packages, creating shipping labels for them, handling amazon returns, and organizing and delivering mail into the store's customer mailboxes."
good,"Was not as I expected supervisors took advantage , then some of the workers would be lazy and wouldn't do much. Would work almost 6 hours without a lunch."
good,I have manage my stress by working in UPS. It is air cargo company the way you work is sometime stressful but yet to beat the stress and achieve our work in time manner that was the fun part.
good,"Though I wish the hours were set, it's all dependent on the work load they receive each day. Other than that it's great exercise and easy work if you're able to move about and lift for a few hours straight."
good,"Great Company, Great Co-Workers, But No Orientation! You show up and sent to a place... & told this is what you need to do, and they,(Supervisor), leaves.... checks in maybe twice during shift!!@???!!!"
good,They work very hard. It was an on call situation not guaranteed work only when needed. It can be long hours. There is not always a restroom available.
good,This facility was a Great place to work even for a short period of time. The managers were very easy to communicate with and hands on.  They explained what job had to done and made sure you had full knowledge of it before stepping away
good,"seasonal during Christmas a lot more packages to be delivered but other than that very easy job and pays well, as you stay with the company longer you get better hourly pay"
good,"A good seasonal job to keep you busy. Friendly people, nice sunny Colorado days. I needed work fast and they got it for me. Even though it's hard everyone sure does have the right attitude"
good,It’s a great job very hard work but I’m only work 5hrs a day and it’s very fast passed work. It has great benefits tho I would recommend it if you do not mind hard work.
good,The pay is good the benefits are fair and location is good. Advancement takes years and you have to know someone or be in a group for them to move up not by skill or seniority
good,Plenty of opportunity to advance for motivated individuals. Fast paced work environment. Problem solving and execution essential for movement into management.
good,Just your typical warehouse work environment. Forklift operations are needed. Basic shipping and receiving of medical parts and computer devices. Monthly safety training.
good,"As a seasonal operations supervisor I was thrown into the job.  I followed around another supervisor to learn my job but he was not good at training.  Only after a few days of observing did I learn the basics but not nearly enough to continue by myself.  The job is so physically demanding. I lifted heavy packages, walked on conveyor belts and would brake up jams where too many packages had collected.  So much leaning, reaching and pushing left my legs incredibly bruised and in pain.  The managers were nice but had to make their ""numbers"" so pushed everyone in the warehouse to the limit."
good,Company could be a bit more organized the supervisor are cool nothing to hard but they have a problem with messing up check so you have to watch it very close
good,"work work during peak season. Its a workload during peak season. You can learn if, the right dept. is hiring and training it avaible to you . All departments are a learning experience."
good,"It’s a great job and really fun. I enjoyed working as a seasonal helper, it was really great. I like working here and the hours go by really fast. I give it a 10 out of 10"
good,"Pretty good working in the company. Takes a little bit to get to higher positions. "
good,Hard work at start up or beginning of career but as the years progress it gets easier! Great benefits once you start. Sometimes you may be asked to work in horrible weather conditions but I’m the end it’s worth it!
good,The sorters either can't do their job or don't care alot of missorts which in turn makes it tough for the loaders it's not tough to sort packages just read the paperwork
good,"Management is emotionally draining, but there are many good people in the company that help share the load. Working a non-Union job and managing Union employees is always a difficult dynamic."
good,The UPS store was the greatest job I have ever gotten but I was treated badly for being Mexican other employees were very rude and  we're not serious always playing around and we're cutting my hours
good,"My experience working at UPS was every day work. Every morning around 4 a.m. it work time. Clock in and go to assigned belt every morning, and wait for the supervisor to give order. I learned how to lift boxes in the right form and how to maintain awareness.  The management was fair with the workers and professional. The workplace culture is very professional and hard work. There was a time where things get to out of hand but things come back to settle and everyone gets back to work. UPS is a very professional company, has its up's and down's but things are very well organized and manage fairly."
good,"Worked there as a manager and office assistant..worked on paperwork an accounts mostly, assisting in sales occasionally when busy and during the holidays. UPS Store isn't actually UPS, it's and individually owned franchise"
good,The job is fairly easy except it’s very hard to get in touch with some of the supervisors. Also they aren’t very good with replacing time cards in a reasonable time
good,"Experienced in managing sales teams & closing complex business solutions in Mid-Market and small Enterprise"
good,"Working in different areas related to our brokerage department has provided a weath of experience. Being a port contact for our call center, it has been a pleasure to assist our valued clients both first time users to our services and accounts in resolving local release delay issues and post release delivery  problems."
good,A Great place to work.  Room for advancement . Physically draining. Very fastpaced. Had to choose from family vs. work. Young mother with a new baby was too much for me. I was one of the only drivers to move up the ladder to full-time package car driver. Good pay.
good,"Senior aged men and women have a difficult time  in gets opportunities for promotions, but they are not the only one, this happens at many large companies."
good,I make my work place better. I give my best to help the company grow up. For me the customer is first and we have to work harder to provide a better service to them.
good,"Package handler is a very intensely physical job. You WILL get in shape. Full benefits after 9 months, tuition reimbursement, discount program, stock options, promotions from within, decent starting wage & unionized. The fast pace makes time fly by & you definitely feel like you’ve been to the gym after your shift lol. You can’t beat it for the fringe benefits, the only down side so far is lack of steady shift or enough hours."
good,I would say there a good place to start as a temp job & good for like a 18 year old . Other then that management sucks they are very rude and lack of help . Employees are lazy and half way do they job .
good,Hard work fast pace I learned alot about sending packages loading and unloading trucks meet new people management friendly I enjoyed everything about this job
good,"Management realized who would say yes to anything and took advantage of good employees. Very strong union giving preferential treatment to employees with longer stay. Multiple years ""paying dues"" before gaining such benefits."
good,UPS is a great company to work for. I've been with the company for almost three years and met a lot of great people that really want to see you succeed in life.
good,While this was one of my favorite jobs they definitely could use some improvement with management but they have great opportunities for advancement. But definitely a great job
good,"Ive had many many jobs in the span of 2 years. Mainly in Vegas but i have traveled to Alaska  and Georgia to follow a paycheck. This job IS NOT for the faint of heart and NOT for the people who complain about the little things that inconvenience them. The workload will be crazy no doubt I found out the hard way. But put in the work, clock in and out and get paid. Benefits take a while to get but its worth it. I can pay my mortgage and pay for my daughters education now."
good,"very fast paced environment, which is something i like as it makes the day go by faster. i had a great supervisor who was willing to bend over backwards for our team which is inspiring to see as i am someone who builds off of that."
good,"Seasonal driver helper, working 20-30 hours per week for approximately 6-7 weeks during the holidays.  A great way to make some extra cash.  Drivers I have worked with are very friendly.  A position where you cannot slack.  It is hard work, but rewarding."
good,I love the job I have but my hours aren’t the best. And some managers have horrible hours around Christmas time. So it’s up to you on if you like the pay enough. Management gets paid pretty well for most the year but might not be worth missing out on all your family time around Christmas season
good,"Great if you want to start a career, I got promoted to supervisor after my first week and was up for another promotion a couple months later before I parted ways to start my own business. Definitely hard work and some nonsense come along from management and the union but you got to take the good with the bad I suppose."
good,The job is not that good and the hours are kind of bad for me because I'm trying to go back to school.and the commute is really long and I need a job closer to me
good,Bonne enseigne et bonne relation avec C’est employé
good,The workplace culture drove me to strive for success and allowed me to progress.  Now I would like to take my skills to a different environment. Most enjoyable part of my day was always completing a successful job.
good,"Worth while company to work for, can learn alot of different tools for different fields of work, like retail and logistic experience. You will also be able to learn customer communication practices that will improve your sales and ability to help a customer in any situation."
good,"A typical day at work was very relaxed, but the second work actually starts its extremely fast paced, there is a heavy emphasis on safety which I enjoyed, the only thing I didnt enjoy was the amount of hours given to me"
good,Good company. Competitive pay. Started as a package unloader for 10.50 an hour and within 30 days was promoted to a part time supervisor with an $8 pay raise.
good,"de auto word beladen met pakketten die je dan weg moet brengen volgens zo efficiëntie route, tevens krijg je ophaal opdrachten die je dan zo moet inplannen dat het allemaal in je route past."
good,"A  day of work at the UPS store is very busy!!! we process not only UPS deliveries and organizing for easy customer pick up, we also sort mail and packages from USPS. There is also phone calls solving UPS package issues. Management is easy to work with and approachable."
good,Günü kurtarmalık iş para kazanmak için yoklukta gider
good,"Having to manage around 9 people each day, many being new to the company or to loading trucks, was extremely stressful. This meant picking up where they could not themselves, leaving me physically and mentally exhausted by the end of the shift, and making going to class a difficult task every day."
good,"Fortune 50 company, great perks/benefits. Hours are PT but but are basically FT during peak November - January - hours are usually over 45-50 but paid time & a half for OT"
good,Enjoyed working here the people are easy to get along with the pay is good for the hours. Would recommend to anyone who likes to work part time hours.
good,I was responsible for loading the UPS trucks with boxes and moving things around the UPS warehouse. I learned how to work as a team and stack boxes really high in the UPS truck.
good,"A great place to learn more about computer systems, emails, faxing, printing and shipping. There were a lot of Spanish speaking customers that needed a translator and that was always fun to help out with."
good,"Work life balance varies according to location and position."
good,It is a good job to start out with. Pretty good pay and has tuition assistance full or partial coverage depending on where you work and when you work.
good,The job is very physically and mentally taxing but the work is very satisfying. It is significantly more demanding than expected. The management is very kind and understanding. It can be a very harsh environment when things go wrong so if you can't handle things getting a bit rough then this probably isn't the best fitting job for you. It is very hard to have a life outside of work at least in my opinion because by the end of the shift I'm exhausted and I'm stuck fighting sleep for the rest of the day.
good,You gain a lot of work experience especially in safety processes which you use body most of the time for lifting and pushing heavy objects. Work place culture involves logistics and time management. UPS has a fast pace working environment. The hardest part of the job is being physically fit to work.
good,"THE UPS STORE  was great for me . 18 years .  I learned a lot about Customer service Packing and shipping, printing mail box service . Meet a lot of good people ."
good,The work is physical and demanding but it worth it because you get the job done in a timely manner. You start with the first truck that you only have about 30 minutes to fully load.
good,not a bad job at all if you opt in for the union and such after 90 days you will get benefits and a little extra pay while i was working there it was only 10.50 an hour plus 200$ a paycheck if you showed up on time everyday you had to work
good,UPS careers can start as full-time or part-time opportunities. Many UPS employees started out as part-time package handlers or seasonal drivers and worked their way into permanent positions. Even the part-time employees will receive full healthcare benefits and may other benefits. They can take advantage of discounts with Verizon wireless and may also receive some tuition assistance.
good,In my short time there you WILL be worked. In the summer it gets hot in the trailers you will be sweating. Vice versa winter its just as cold as it is outside. You need a job dont be shy just dont think you can skate by or take it easy. It is union as well if you dont know
good,"UPS can be a great company to work for depending on your goals. There are many opportunities to grow and learn, and many advancement opportunities.  If you work hard you can make enough to easily provide for your family. The tradeoff is the hours you work in management and the stress levels can be overwhelming. You may work 10 to 15 hours a day. There is no work life balance."
good,At the beginning of the work day i would meet up with the driver at a pick up site and that would start the day.  We would make our deliveries until the truck was empty and when it was emptied out our day would end.
good,I got bonus of about 150 dollars every week. But I didn't come in everytime. My part time supervisors were good except for chris. But my full time supervisors were not good people. I got hurt on the job and they tried to fire me. Good thing there is a union. Everything else was pretty decent.
good,"UPS has a very strange culture. They are trying to modernize but it is still a bit of a good old boy network. They have started bringing in senior level folks from other companies, which I think is a step in the right direction."
good,Good work environment in the warehouse. Fast pace and always busy. Can’t complain. Just wished break was longer for amour of work is expected a good job to have overall
good,Great seasonal job. I needed work  I was hired quickly and used often. Good hours. Given plenty of opportunity to work. The work was demanding and you really need to be in shape
good,Good job hard work plenty of advancement work life balance is bad long hours after Thanksgiving good career if you could put up with the odd hours great benefit package
good,"The company is great with benefits and the overall corporate culture is great. The job security is also great, but the opportunity to climb up the corporate ladder is tough due to the longevity of the employees."
good,It's a good start but you probably won't go anywhere unless you want to be a driver and even then good luck with that. It will keep you busy so you won't be bored but if you can't handle getting over loaded and giving up... you won't make it. Just do what you can and nothing less and you will he fine.
good,"Company will take care of you, but it is hard work no matter where you are at. They expect everyone to work overtime. The benefits package is good for hourly and management employees."
good,"working for ups was a great experience. do your work and mind your business and there will be no problems. i had the best supervisor you could ask for named martha, she moved fast but she was patient with me while training."
good,"Driving was very stressful, yet fun. You had about 150 stops a day. "
good,Working at UPS is not the best but not the worst either. The pay is pretty good for it being a part time job and you can always double shift you want to make more money.
good,"UPS was a great place to work as far as wages and benefits go, but they are extremely demanding and safety is really just a slogan to them.  In reality their priorities are production, then service, followed by safety.  They have a militaristic style of management that gets very old after a few years.  Management is done by threat and intimidation.  Once you have some seniority you will be ok but the first few years they will use you like you can't believe.  They are never satisfied with your production so get all your job satisfaction from your pay and the appreciation your customers have for your hard work and service provided."
good,"They could offer more hours! Also promote within alot better than they say do. Full-time supervisor had the ability to put a hold on promotion of a seniority worker who is trying to move up to a driving position. Reasoning when questioned ""I need you here because no one else can run it like u do""."
good,I learned lots of thing here. They trained me. I am enjoying working here. Very flexible hours. I work 30hrs a week. I really like this place to work.
good,"UPS has great benefits and most of the people I worked with, other handlers and supervisors, we're really nice. The job is fast paced though and they will expect you to learn the process behind loading and unloading very quickly. As for moving up the ladder in the company most of the supervisors at the plant I worked would actively tell you that they would put in a good word you as long as you did your job well and efficiently. Though it is worth mentioning that some supervisors actually enjoyed the lower positions due to how the were treated by other higher-ups. As some suggestions would be completely ignored even if it made our jobs easier."
good,"And they weren't kidding. At least if you are a driver or work in a distribution center. I've done both."
good,it was a good company but it wasn't my first choice.the work was stressful and tiring. the people were cool put it got worse for me over time. management is not so great they are treated poorly and overworked
good,"Worked in several positions with the company.  Management is mainly located in the US.  Culture is good.  Fair pay, bonuses and benefits.  Must be prepared to work overtime."
good,"UPS is one of the best logistics Internationally even here in PH. People, culture and managent is good enough to make its people grow and stay for good."
good,"quick interviews to replace a leaving associate were not thorough, but the training process was. believed maximum paid wage should be raised from 10$ an hour to at least 11$ as most positions entail management skills. my manager is a slacker, so the work environment is quite lax in my experience."
good,Christmass time gets busy the most. The job is fairly easy once you get a handle of it. Packaging is the most important thing. Be extra careful when serving a customer.
good,A typical day of work consists of getting in early and stretching before you stand in a line by the conveyor belts and boxes start flying at you at an expeditious pace. As your trying to read the number and letter codes on the boxes that go to specific sides of several belts you are trying to move these boxes to there correct placement before the belt starts to pile up (at or above 1000 per hour.) This goes on for about 4 or more hours with a 10 minute break inbetween. For me the exercise was the most enjoyable part of the job though others may say it is the chatter amongst coworkers. Management may have you at several different areas performing several different jobs during the course of a day depending on how reliable you are to do so in a quick and speedy manner. The hardest part of the job (if you can get past the 60lbs. weight limit of packages) would probably have to be the sort chart which they like to refresh from time to time to keep things interesting.
good,It was fun and rewarding yet the work load during the holiday seasons was really stressful. The management was kind for the most part and I enjoyed working with a lot of the management even if the higher ups were rude sometimes
good,Great people to work for. Everyone works together to accomplish goals and answer customer concerns in a prompt manner. Whenever anything is needed everyone works together to accomplish that need.
good,"There's never much time to sit down on the job. Everyone, at one point or another, has to ship something. The original boss and manager of the store really made the experience worthwhile. Some workplace drama was not unheard of but I kept out of it."
good,"This company helped me help myself. It isn't easy sometimes and they demand a lot. But work hard and leap at opportunity and this company will make a spot for you, because they can. Great benefits and excellent pay once into management or a vested union employee. Work and Life balance is essential to survive this career."
good,"Worked here during there hoilday peak season. Your day is, drive around with the driver getting packages to people houses. You dont get to leave until the work is done."
good,Working at UPS is very rewarding . Great work environment however still professional. Also gives the feeling of doing good and contributing to the community
good,"Working at ups has its challenges but it’s a great job with good pay. I recommend this job to a lot of people, exactly people who are unemployed or coming out of school"
good,"Overall, the benefits and other incentives  balanced with the hard work that was required daily. It definitely tests your strength and resilience and isn't for those who don't work hard. You are gonna sweat and gonna get dirty!!!"
good,"The benefits are what drew me and kept me there.  Fee health, dental, vision through union after a year employed.  Free tuition through the CRCP program enrolled on your first day.  Paid holidays.  I stayed 3 years till I had to find different employment"
good,Benefits and pay are great but the company keeps taking more and more away and giving it to the teamsters. Drivers get away with everything and the upper management has no backbone. You will never see you family especially during the holidays.
good,"The only unfortunate thing was the lay offs, after being told in training ""You are all fully hired for the company, which is a great thing because once you're hired you are GUARANTEED A POSITION within the company""."
good,Wish I had more hours  . Love working there . It’s a fast pace job . Wish more suitable  hours . Don’t see  a chance for advancement.  My manager is fair but sometimes harsh but overall she is good
good,"Job was holiday season work, I had a good experience but have heard differently from others. The job is lots of lifting but training had me 100% prepared."
good,"It was okay, but promotions aren't merit based by any means. Way more politics than it was worth. I enjoyed the people, and it becomes a routine after awhile. However, you eventually feel very stuck in one place."
good,"Responsibilities include customer service, fax, copy, finger printing, mail, packing boxes for shipping. Also responsible for handling daily transactions and managing fellow employees in daily activities. "
good,Loved my job and had a wonderful experience with the staff.  The management does need some improvement and doesnt listen to the employees. If you need benefits it's the best place to work.
good,"I've been working at UPS for almost 3 years now, and do not intend to leave. it is a great place to work at and good people to work with. I would recommend this job to anyone, who likes working outdoors, in a solo fashion or as a team."
good,"Overall I really liked it, did my seventeen years and set myself up to move on.  You can make a lot of money here with great benefits but you need to be ready to work. Most people that have a problem here are the ones that don't want to work. Yes management has become a joke over the years and the micromanage you to no end but you are compensated to deal with that. Get in young, make that money, and get out when you don't want to do it anymore."
good,Working at UPS was a great job and I saw a lot of my future there. I left because the specific location I was at was just too far. That was the hardest part of the job. I like to stay active so it was perfect for me
good,"I was thinking this job would be a lot better than it ultimately was. I was looking for a holiday season job, and figured this would be a good opportunity. I was surprised it was just minimum wage, considering it is technically a union-job, (actually you pay union dues so it really is sub-minimum wage). The hours just arent' there.You get a call early in the morning (around 7 a.m.) to see if you want to work, sleep through it and your're out of luck. If you do answer, they'll say to be ready around 9 a.m. You meet your driver on their route somewhere and help deliver and pick up packages for a few hours, maybe five or so total. "
good,"management is extremely hard to work with.  dress and grooming rules . way to fast paced , did 30 now retiring had enough. job for young people . great benifits"
good,"This position was a seasonal one. All assigned drivers that I worked with were a pleasure to work alongside, helpful, knowledgable. Long hours applied but as the position was fun the time passed by quickly. Getting the assignments to work any particular day was a mission as managers would randomly contact me when I had already been assigned by another. in the end I worked my own schedule with drivers which proved very effective and benefited UPS by default."
good,Great experience . Excellent co-workers. Professional environment.   Loved delivering packages to customers for which the overwhelming majority were really nice people.
good,"As a part-time employee at UPS the most beneficial thing you receive is benefits.  Part-time employees enjoy full time benefits at no cost!  On the other hand, the work is very physical and the building is not climate controlled.  Outside of the peak season around the holidays, you will not work more than 4 hrs per shift.  During peak season hours are unlimited and you receive overtime pay after working 5 hrs.  I really enjoyed my time working there.  There are opportunities if you would like to become full-time if you would like to become a driver!  They operate under a union so pay is negotiated when each contract ends."
good,I worked at The UPS Store during high school and as a filler job until I obtain a position at a corporate level. It is a good starting point for anyone who is looking for part time or full time work to gain work experience.
good,"It was my own franchise. The UPS Store NOT UPS"
good,"In my opinion UPS is a average warehouse job. Just like any other warehouse there are precautions individuals must take to insure their own safety. Also, individuals must be able to lift 60 lbs."
good,"The first two weeks are definitely the hardest. After that, it becomes routine and is very easy in my opinion. They provide really good benefits and there is lots of room to grow and move up in that company. It's really a shame that I had to leave but I would definitely recommend this job to just about every person I come across."
good,A normal day at UPS is very challenging. Many people they higher are terrible workers and there is not enough work to work an 8 hour shift to live. it is nit worth working unless you become a driver.
good,"Working at UPS was pretty straightforward. You clocked in, walked to your morning meeting and work until the job was done. Some departments were boring, I enjoyed unloading the most, its quick paced and the employees are awesome."
good,"I loved the fast passed work, however I was not able, physically (due to a bad back) to cut it. Management was not all that great, but for the most part, not bad place"
good,while I worked at UPS it was difficult for me but I also had a lot of fun with my coworkers there at the time I thought it was pointless but that job taught me many lessons
good,"I worked in several aspects of the facility. I started off as a loader/unloader, moved into part time management, and eventually moved up to a full time management position."
good,"Good place but there is a lot of micro management, everything is by seniority!!! Lot’s of good people!! Some supervisors try to take advantage of staff, but you have to stand up and call them out!!"
good,"It's a good company to work for with great benefits, salary and stock options.  Lacks in not giving the option to workers to grow or transfer within company or geographical location."
good,This job ideally is for someone who has strength. They have advancement in the company. They also pay for education. They give cash back when grades good.
good,Part time package handlers at this facility should be paid more per hour due to the rugged work environment that puts wear and tear on your body. And this applies to anyone.
good,The drivers I worked with were friendly the job was fast paced but not stressful. I personally loved the job. I'd like to work there again given the chance.
good,UPS is a great job for work Experience especially as I have on the job application I highly recommend it to work care because there’s multi things we do here other than just ship packages we do printing banners laminations we even provide mailboxes to receive packages and etc.
good,"I enjoyed working here but the customers and the management make it less enjoyable than it should be. Most of the time, coworkers do not follow orders and blame is often assessed on the wrong individual. Also, very few hours and opportunities are given and overall, not worth working for."
good,"As a driver helper, I would go door to door and put the packages on the door steps. I liked that a lot because it kept me moving, but wasn't too overwhelming."
good,HIghly fast-paced and workloads can be strenuous and overbearing but the environment is collaborative so help is generally available. Hours are perfect for a college student in need of money since class schedules will never conflict with hours however there is a learning curve to working through the night and studying through the day
good,I liked working there every one was polite it wasn’t any drama and if u needed help wit anything all u had to do was ask and they were really flexible wit the schedule
good,"Being a seasonal helper was a simple and easy job, we just assisted the drivers deliver the boxes. It was also pretty busy, because there were a lot of packages to deliver thanks to the winter season."
good,Good seasonal work but very fast paced. Have to deal with people that are mad because their packages did not show up so that can be very frustrating and difficult
good,"It’s a very reliable company. Returns are easy, products are great as well as prices. They have a great website that makes it nice to shop from. They sell everything to the point you really don’t need to leave home. They are doing everything right as far as running a successful business. You can read reviews of people who have alley purchased the products"
good,I like this job even though it was a temp position due to my previous employer laying off unexpectedly. The days were quick and over before I knew it. I would recommend U.P.S to others.
good,"hard work is required if you are a loader. definitely worth it though. once I became a supervisor the responsibilities and conduct of the position were taken seriously. All in all, I would say UPS is a good place to work."
good,"Work life balance is tough to get past, rewards are good but can strain on relationships. Easy to get 8n, but it's a lot about who you know and not always what you know a d how well you perform"
good,"Got to meet lots of new people, and learn about different design softwares as well as how to properly package and ship items. Performed other duties as well, such as copying and faxing. It was pretty laid back."
good,I really like how management recognizes the good work of employees and also the professional attitude towards seansonal employees was positive.  Getting recognize for hard work and being askes by other shifts supervisors to assist their team was one of the best compliments an employee could receive in a extremely fast past environment.
good,"when I started out working for UPS I loved it here. I was a warehouse 2.  a couple years later I was moved to a warehouse 4. which is a lead over the area. of course it put a lot more work and later more stress on me.  the management at first was great, then they started to move them around and let them go and bring other management in and things started to change for the worst. my job wasn't the same anymore. it wasn't enjoyable. the management wasn't around anymore to help. I was left to their job with a leads pay. its started to be unfair. When I needed help from higher up, I couldn't get it, then that's when business started to decline as well."
good,UPS was a nice place to work while I was in college.  The scheduled allowed for me to have classes at all times of the day.  They also offered to help pay for school if you committed to their company for so long.
good,I worked for UPS as a seasonal drivers helper. I had a driver that was easy to work with and we could have good conversation so it was fun and the days generally went by quickly. It is peak season so be ready to really be working. It is great for a college student and they do work around your school schedule but really be ready to put all the rest of your free time into the job. It was great for me because it is usually only for 2 months and the money is quick and great considering you are basically getting paid to work out. I enjoyed it but I can see how someone may not.
good,"Work hours are quite a lot. You are fairly compensated for the work you do. The work place environment is fast paced, physical and competitive. Good place for advancement"
good,"Fast paced dispatching. Dispatched many jobs an hour to independent contractors, Adapt in organizing my time and information. Management was good and work place culture was good. Hardest thing is its fast paced and low pay. The people were good and we got along."
good,"Surrounded by inteliigent and driven people, and dealing with a variety of unique businesses. Unfortunately, the internal hurdles and pain points have grown tremendously. Micromanaged at all angles, and constantly reminded what you are not doing."
good,"It was my first job experience and I think that it was a good job to start with, the drivers and employees at the building were very helpful and if I had a question, I could ask and have it answered. A typical day involved lifting and delivering boxes and packages of various sizes and weights and to people in my community who I may or may not have known. The manager was very friendly and was very helpful to the drivers and would deliver packages too from time to time. I did learn that there's a general consensus in the parcel delivering community that you should never order dog food, it's large, clunky, and slams into everything. The part of the job that I loved the most though, was being able to see all the scenery around my community that I haven't been able to see before and enjoy the cool weather. I have and will continue to recommend this job to others."
good,If your in school I wouldn’t recommend you work for ups it takes up so much of your free time. They don’t provide enough hours during the week and the pay doesn’t match all the work you do.
good,"UPS has 4 different shifts across all times of the day so there's a good chance one of them will fit your schedule. The hours are usually in the 25-30 range each week so there's plenty of time for school. And the cherry on top is the education assistance, which you can start using the day you get hired. Be prepared to earn it though, UPS is hard work!"
good,"Mostly packing up cable boxes, processing drop-off boxes, and working the system to make sure all boxes are accounted for. Its easy, but tedious and it is easy to get overloaded."
good,"Meet for two-three hours to plan the day ahead, actual operations is only 3 hours then fill out reports and clean the building for 5 hours then post sort for 2 hours."
good,"Fast Paced environment, Management wants the job done right the first time in a efficient manner. The hardest part of the job is managing union employees."
good,Hours have been cut majorly. Management makes big decisions that affects their workers majorly. Short hours makes our paycheck basically cut in half. Helps that school is getting paid for.
good,Excellent company for employment. Career advancement opportunities available always. Energy driven environment that promotes positivity and drive to take on next levels.
good,"A typical day at work involve -Clock in, unload trucks, help others if needed until all trucks are unloaded"
good,"You will always have something to do.  You will be assisting the supervisors, drivers and clerks per day.  You will assist with late airs, driver blow-outs and customer concerns."
good,This is a tough job. It is physically demanding. You receive a week of paid training both digitally and on the floor. They hire for winter seasonal and have a high attrition rate. The dedicated employees help make dull work manageable.
good,Working as a Driver Assistant was an alright job during the holidays. While the hours where random and you get called in when they need you other task did get offered when not needed. The common one was to sort mail in their hub.
good,I could take your day with OK just depends on how many packages have to be shipped that days it was OK some days overwhelmed and I didn't like that you didn't know what time you get off
good,UPS is a great company to start at the bottom and work your way up. A lot of time and devotion is required in a management position. A good place for a young and determined employee
good,"As a seasonal helper a driver helper is a good starter job, the position is outdoors and is fast paced, the job itself is simple, move boxes from one place to another, only slowing down if you have to wait for a signature."
good,"A typical day working at UPS on the Ramp is unloading a plane, finding cans that need to go into the plane, and then reloading the plane. It's a part time job with really great benefits. Don't expect to get more that 16 hours or so unless it is peak season."
good,"Great opportunity , great benefits as well as opportunity to move up within company. Great staff and easy to work with . Also company is very stable and secure"
good,"A typical day at UPS for me was clocking in at 11:55 pm, clean my work area. Put my materials into place. Turn on my computer and start the software that I use.  "
good,"A typical day at work would be to go through the guard check and proceeded with clocking in until the sort was ready to start. You have to be fast and able to keep up with putting boxes in trailer for 4-5 hrs straight. You had to be able to lift package that were 50+ LB on daily basis. The hardest part about this job was not being able to have enough people on each trailer, so it meant more hard work for people that were faster. The only enjoyable time on this job was the bonus you get if you were there everyday when you needed to and the lunch break was the only time to relax."
good,"I've been there since August of '05 and only worked in 2 areas. "
good,The hardest part of the job was to be prepare for any thing during the four to five hour shift. You worked in warehouse type of environment that had to work in trailer or around a noisy place.
good,"Management is old fashion, sometimes that isn't a good thing."
good,"This was my first job out of college.  A typical day was a long day. You did leave work until the work was done and your boss left before you.  What I learned was disciplined, time management, and to work with difficult people.  The hardest part of the job was being a new mom; the environment/culture (back in 1996) was not very understanding towards working mothers."
good,"A fun, easy going workplace environment, hours kinda long but there is overtime pay"
good,Looking for advancement at UPS takes you to either driving or management. I wet with management and became a supervisor being with the company for almost 3 years only taking me 3 months to get the promotion. I worked extremely hard as an hourly and a supervisor having the pleasure of learning the ins and outs of the building managing almost every area for the twilight sort. Working as a supervisor was not easy it is a lot of responsibility managing people and getting the best out of all your employees even if they are being difficult. However for those management skills and learning how to work in a high pressure environment. I can easily recommend this job to anyone if that sounds appealing to them.
good,"Great raises, great benefits, management ok. Nice place to work but takes forever to get full time. Driver supervisors are great. Union is on your side."
good,"Monday, checking email 20 +, Departments requesting Security paperwork faxed, around 25 to up to 35 pt new hire employees starting, have to enter names in the system, and about 3 to 8 new UPS drivers coming into the office requesting new badges,taking their photos and making the ids, while waiting for the pt employee IDs #, and phone is ringing, employees are coming in to get silver stickers. From 11:30 am to 1:30, and the pt new hire employees ID #'s come in at 12:30 or 1 pm, have to make IDs before 2:00.  And mostly after that, I am answering phones, deleting ID's, until 4 pm, the next shift starts of new hires and so on."
good,Ottimo habitat tra le persone che lavorano nel reparto finance e controllo di gestione
good,"UPS is a great job, especially for young people in college, but if you have bills to pay, UPS is not the place for you. Only offering between 20 and 30 hours a week, but it does have amazing benefits such as its great insurance"
good,Its mostly a good place to work. Early risers will do better as shifts typically begin at 0430 and last until 0800. Turnover is high especially with management. Is creates management that can not always do the job they are supervising which cause conflicts.
good,"I worked here during my winter break between quarters at my university. It was a lot of hard work, and required some stamina and physical lifting capabilities, but fun overall."
good,"Ever day would start with staffing which started the day very intensified. If someone was missing we would have to pull from the unload and that would cause a chain reaction . Like robbing peter to pay Paul. It would effect the production which was the primary goal of every day, hit production numbers. With UPS you couldn't just replace a person with a supervisor like FedEx. You had to pull an hourly from another department which would in turn effect that areas production for the day. This was all because of the union. Any time a supervisor try to work in place of a no show , there would be a compliant filed the next day. That got old fast and eventually had to go. Not for every one every day."
good,"Typical hands on culture inspired on a long culture of founding fathers until today."
good,Good place to win if you like warehouse work.  I enjoyed it.  They do lay people off a lot.  It is a seasonal job.  So employment is rare.  But once you have a career your there for good.
good,"I would have stayed, but UPS Freight had a labor contract that had to be negotiated after I got hired.  About a month later I was reduced hours due to volume reduction and layoffs.   I was junior person on the dock."
good,"Working at UPS was very fun. Everyone I met was really awesome. The only downside was at the beginning when everything was coming down the belts or shoots really fast, but you will get the hang of it real quickly. Also there are certain areas/places where packages come from and it's constantly moving. Other than that I had an awesome time, met amazing people. You can either take the shuttle or walk to your building - I prefer walking, but riding the shuttle has it's advantages, especially if your building is far in the back."
good,"As a drivers helper we are on and off the truck very often. we help deliver the packages to our customers,and businesses, there is defiantly a lot of walking involved with this job!"
good,"I was skeptical at first, really started to enjoy the job. Had to be good on directions and time. I had good pay but no benefits because it was seasonal."
good,I started off at UPS as a loader which was a very difficult job physically and did not pay well. Once past the probationary period the benefits and union support was phenomenal. I opted to go the management route which meant I forfeited all of my union benefits but would be able to pursue a higher position within the company and give me the opportunity to lead. I ultimately left the company because of the low amount of hours and pay that was offered and easily found better alternatives elsewhere.
good,I really don't have kno tips. Its hard at 1st working there but once tou get in the hang of it its pretty easy. I would just say show up on time do your job and go home. It can be stressful and over whelming but give up and just try your best at.
good,Every day was unpredictable.  There is always a load that doesn't go out.  So there was always a driver or two expected to take packages out that isn't on their regular routes.
good,The days were always random but never too hard. I wanted more work but I didn't get a permanent job. It was very nice to meet new people but I wish the pay was a bit better.
good,UPS  IS OK but the  not really a place i highly recommend working there as a employee unless you are  trying to drive the hours are a bit low but i have learned to work and adapt myself in a steady hard paste i have gained a lot of stocking skills been dedicated for 5 years moved up as a supervisor the hardest part of the job is the delayed miss sort trailers when others dont come in short of staff the most enjoyable part of the job is helping others and finishing the  job before down time
good,All The UPS Store Stores are independently owned. Every store will have a different environment. The job is steady and each location has its own set of challenges.
good,"People are very friendly.  Sometimes the goals are unrealistic.  They try to make the day as fun as possible.  Overall, a good place to work.  I recommend it for entry level."
good,"Little to no enforcement of rules as basic as attendence and insubordination "
good,"I was a seasonal driver at UPS, I loved it growing up I would watch King of Queens so this was basically my dream job unfortunately my HQ *cue* wasn’t hiring any drivers full time so now I’m currently on call I believe but really want to start in Texas and deliver packages and do schedule pick ups until I’m old and grey"
good,"Daily working at UPS was simple but worked on your mental the most, with the working conditions with the weather and if your not physically ready it could get the best of you."
good,The work is very physical.  I really hurt my shoulder working here from the repetitive motion.  However I will say this is good for someone joining or rejoining the workforce.
good,Un travail de jour comme de nuit polyvalence .apprendre à gérer un magasin et faire les commandes
good,"Large influx of packages. I learned  how to work more efficiently and quickly.  Management left a little to be desired, in terms of organization and leadership. Not much help when problems arose.  Not a very cheerful atmosphere.  Constant heavy lifting, and having to overextend.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I"
good,Good Company to work for.  The variety of the tasks are good to allow one to find an area that suits one.  I learned the value of detail and working with people.
good,Not enough hours to maintain bills. They do offer to pay for schooling while you work there. It’s a fast paced job so if you like fast paced work it’s the job for you. They need to offer more full time to their workers.
good,"UPS is a great company. Because it is such a large company there are many opportunities to pursue jobs in various fields."
good,"Pay and benefits are good. Management for the most part is good but there are also those that tend to be unrealistic with the time study of delivery procedures. Overall, good company to work for. You work hard, you earn good wages and benefits!"
good,"If your young, it's worth sticking it out. You receive many benefits. Health Insurance, 401K, Life Insurance, Pension, Stock Options, Vision, Dental, etc. If your older, it sucks. The days can be long. Overtime is made available, when needed. "
good,Typical day starts about 9:00am.  We have a 5 minute safety meeting prior to hitting the road. We then do a pre-trip of our trucks making sure all lights horn and signals are in working order.  We have freight that has a 10:30 am commit time.  Then we have an order to follow of delivering the rest of our packages. Sometime in the afternoon around 2:30-3:00 there are scheduled pick up to make regardless if all your deliveries are made.  After pick ups you continue to finish delivering the rest of your load until finished no matter the time of night.  On return to the building you unload you priority packages and  do a post trip on your vehicle.  Then proceed to checkout and finish paperwork and punch out.
good,"Fast paced oriented job, hardest part is getting up in the morning. Job is self explanatory. Advancement can be based on who you know and/or seniority."
good,UPS is the hardest job I have ever done. They pay very well but you do truly sell your soul. I loved working with the hardest workers on the planet. Came a time in my life that I wanted to do more than yell at teamsters for a living so I left.
good,"UPS Border Broker section was a good job in a very small community of Blaine, WA. The software systems were very antiquated. The management had been the same for years and were not very open to new ideas. "
good,The seasonal job was easy and fun. Being a driver helper was a convenient  job to have during the final semester of college i would recommend to people looking to make extra money.
good,"Working at UPS was similar to working at any other job; you work with others and you need to do it quick and efficiently. However the workers there demand a lot of respect without giving very much back. Most days you will want to quit, especially if you are hired around the winter season. If you can get past the negative attitude and still be a good worker than it is something I would recommend."
good,Temporary seasonal position I would help driver with deliveries. Relaxed work environment but fast paced constantly in and out of truck doing deliveries
good,I typical workday is usually steady paced and goes by quickly. The hardest part about the job is remembering to bend your knees and don’t strain your back
good,Learned leadership and organizational management techniques that are transferable to multiple industries.  Strong operational excellence culture that rewards hard work and results.
good,"UPS was a very fast paced job and requires a lot of energy to get the job done. It was very good pay for part time work and they would offer overtime when ever there was overtime to offer. During their peak season, which starts in November, is when I would acquire the most hours and is when they would offer the most overtime. This is not a job where you can support a family unless you had another part time job. I would have stayed with UPS if they would offer more full time positions."
good,The only negative aspect of this job was working during the holidays. Since customers are looking to ship during the holidays we would have a large growth of customers coming to the store. Most days were stressful with hardly any opportunity to relax or take a quick lunch break. Other than those couple of weeks it was a fun job and the people I worked with were very easy to get along with.
good,"The coworkers are good people for the most part and help out a lot whenever you need it. The management team is pretty ok, some are better than others but you can always depend on them and go to them for anything you need. It’s a fast paced job but if you do your job right it’s pretty easy."
good,Die arbeit eigentlisch war gut aber der tiemleiter war schlimm
good,"Normally, UPS is a relaxed environment. However I was there during the holiday season and during the holiday season it is high octane. It can be stressful while you are learning. But once you can get into a groove, you should be fine."
good,"El ambiente dentro de Ups! era muy agradable, el trato con el cliente era de forma directa, y me gustaba poder ayudar a las personas, pues el trabajo permite al empleado acercarse más al cliente y así poder entender mejor sus inquietudes y requerimientos, brindando así un mejor servicio."
good,"UPS was indeed a hive, and we were like bee's, I remember being tired all the times. I was not alone on that everyone was tired out, but energetic and positive.  Friendly environment, excellent management and fellow worker bee's.  It was somewhat fun."
good,to work here you have to be deticate and sometimes willing to work over time around holidays you have to be fast and do job accordingly you have to be careful and patient
good,Teamster union job with lots of benefits.take out weekly union dues. Lots of inside part time jobs available. Can work various shifts. Has many employees around
good,Fun competitive work environment learn to do team work and get the job done. Hours are limited as your get the job done quicker. But its great place to work.
good,"Good place to work.   I loaded and unloaded packages, boxes, and general freight from trucks as directed by management. In order to ensure they got to their intended destinations on time."
good,"In UT I had a good experience and liked it, but when I transferred to CA... went down hill. Maybe its just me and local CA folk that don't mix well, but yeah..."
good,"Lots changed since 1984,  I started as a preloaded, part time and then started driving in 1985.  I really loved my, my customers and people in general!!! I am very out going, it was the perfect job for me..  I worked as my own boss basically, did my job on my own. I was outdoors which I love and always very busy.  Made a very good salary but I worked very hard for it too.  "
good,good place to work & make good money . but if you don’t put in hours then your pay check won’t look as good as you think it would look like . also bring snacks & plenty of water
good,The job was fast paced and exciting; got to help and meet alot of folks;  Warehouse environment was only bad when you had to leave the office; but when offered permanent position the pay was barely above minimum wage for an adult with a family it was a joke and the hours were only part time so they didn't have to pay benefits.  Would work holiday again if I could but would and could never work for them permanent.
good,"This is a good job for anyone trying to get into the corporate world or work for a company with good benefits and a union."
good,"Good people with a good attitude "
good,every day is quick paced. But if you like to workout this is a great place for employment. many opportunities to grow within the company and everyone starts out the same level of work.
good,Ups is a great logistical sop . they cons are only that they use temporaries for important job responsibilities that do not care as much as they should about moving product down the line . pros would be that i have set hours and that my role is to maintain sorters and equipment i enjoy the work just not the night shift hours
good,I worked at UPS during college so they would pay for it but I found it hard to balance my work and school life. It's not as easy as it sounds. Great company to get into though.
good,"Good company as long as you understand if you are working part-time you will not be have the opportunity to work full-time for a very long time. There are many positions out there, if you want to do something else in the company its easy to move around after you have been there for awhile."
good,Depending on what Hub you are working at can make it's a good place to work or not that good depending on what managers you also have. The nice thing is you do top out in a year then have full benefits
good,"Great company benefits. It was over 20 years ago, so things have changed quite drastically. Former positions are no longer available in the location and people either left the company or were assigned to other work areas."
good,"Tough but good temporary job. I would recommend this position"
good,good place for benefits. pay is no good unless you got seniority and can make hours. management favors certain workers. union is falling apart. teamsters do not look out for one another
good,"Great Benefits, Job Security, Great Worklife Balance, Great Company, Great People to work with but Lack of Advancement, and No time off during Holiday Season"
good,UPS is a fast paced job. Answering constant ring phones helping customer with their concerns. Lots of walking on property making sure all trailers have been unloaded. Some data entry
good,Ups is physically demanding and fast paced. There is many benifits and potential to grow however you must be able to handle the deadlines and match the speed they ask of you.
good,Great company with great drivers. Union is key for the drivers. Must be 21 to drive and seniority is the key to moving up. Will help you aching your goals
good,"One of the managers gave preferential treatment to other employees. And was not reliable or approachable. Constantly had to watch what was said depending on her mood. Other than that manager, the job was wonderful and coworkers were great!"
good,it's really an ok job. you have to have a good team of people. it's harder to get through the day when there is people who complain or don't know what they're doing. it's all about the environment with this job. some days are heavy some days are light and you have to be prepared for whatever happens and keep objectivity because it can be a stressful job if you let it.
good,"A team of fifteen, to safely bring in a 747 to unload than load cargo. Ensuring all weights and placards were in place, securing aircraft is balanced and all documentation is in order. Assisting Pilots and maintenance crews with various duties. I learned the value of a time regiment and orderly paperwork. the most difficult aspect would be dealing with the Unions. the most enjoyable moments are watching that aircraft get off the ground."
good,Company itself is wonderful. The issues are with employees and management.  Some managers expect you to be on call 24/7 even though the business is closed on weekends.
good,"Ran operations of processing over 50,00 parcels a day. Managed over 125 employees and supervisors. Responsible for production goals and reducing injuries to my employees."
good,"No one seems to give positive feedback or thank you for any work that you do. Management is always yelling at you or scolding you for something you didn't do, even if they never told you had to do it."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking care of customer needs like shipping printing and Notary requests. Other activities include handling the cash register, balancing the register at the end of the day and taking phones calls from customers. The job has taught me how to be a tougher person through all aspects and how to be patient with people. I work with 1 manager and 2 other associates. When we have free time and no customers are in the store we talk about everything. From lunch to weeekend plans. I would say the hardest part of the job is whenever technology falls apart and rebooting is in order. The most enjoyable part would be interacting with customers and asking them questions and getting to know there faces and what they want."
good,"A typical day fast paste, I learned a lot about conveyor systems and unloaders, management were always great an fair to me, the culture were great also, the hardest part of the job was having more than one break down at one time, the most enjoyable part of the job were starting a project and finishing the project."
good,I only work temporary so I can't say much about it. It was nice the first year but it was  a lot of physical movement and requires a lot of upper body strength
good,Great place to work for the amount of time you were there. Pay and benefits were good. Fast pace with accuracy is challenging. Holiday volume was the worst part.
good,"health and pension  are very good.working conditions  is excellent. safety  concerns   is always addressed,  periodic developmental training is  always    implemented"
good,Learned the ways of how packaging and delivering is like and how much effort is needed to get to the client. Also good working experience for people going to college since it's part time.
good,"Good job for part-timers.  Offers decent wage and benefits.  Can be stressful, but is manageable.  Peak season gets a little rough.  Very metrics driven."
good,"Very fast paced, very physically demanding, and very rewarding place to work. Would work more for seasonal work or part time warehouse work. Steady hours and pay."
good,"Great place to work. "
good,You basically unload or load trucks for 3-4 hours a day management can be rude and will always be hard on you but you just gotta ignore them and focus on your work.
good,"As a package handler, I loaded and unloaded trucks. This work was fast paced, hot, and confusing. The people that worked there were not at all nice and teamwork was missing."
good,One must enjoy sweating and working hard. Long non stop days jumping in and out of truck lifting packages and running in and out of buildings and up and down stairs.
good,It was alot of packing and scanning boxes. Loading them on the truck in a specific loading method. Carefully handling hazardous materials. Separation of bulk item
good,"Great place to start off for a job but this should not be a long term job. nice pay and beinfits but always look for bettter, ups not a bad place you can andavce if you but your mind to it ."
good,"I worked independently setting appointments for deliveries. Only a few hours a day, everyone pretty much did what they were ask of, wish the job would have offered benefits. I started out working nights than switched to day hours. If they would have had a full time position I would have liked to stay employed."
good,It's a quick paced work environment with a lot of activity involved. There is plenty room for advancement within the company. There are also good benefits but you have to be there a year before you receive them.
good,"A fast pace, working against the clock made my day fo by faster. "
good,Really for me it was fun realizing how the packages were not being shipped but by how it was processed through the system we call the United Postal Service.
good,"I started working for UPS the week after I graduated HS. I started out as a package handler and moved up to a management role in a matter of months. A great work ethic is required here. You can't be lazy or you won't last. I've gained a lot of experience through the time have been there that I am very grateful for. With this knowledge gained it not only gives me the opportunity to advance in the company, but others if I chose to leave."
good,"I worked for UPS for 3-4 years now, and is a great company to work for.  I do not further information to provide a review summary about UPS at this time."
good,"Can  work on their training process "
good,"}As a supervisor my daily duties were to run my area with my crew while maintaining safety and working efficiently."
good,before ups bought out overnight transportation this was a great place to work.  once ups bought it in 2003 it was  corporate setting but great pay and benefits
good,"Working for UPS is like changing the channel on TV"
good,"Fun place to work at, but management can be a pain. Had a great experience though and learned a ton of useful skills. Organization and being active helps"
good,".Great benefits, but coming the most taxing manual labors you will go through. do not accept this job if you are a stranger to hard work. the expecting a demanding performance from all their workers."
good,"Ambiente favorável, trabalho em equipe e comprometimento. Empresa que insere o trabalho voluntário, agregando valor humano."
good,a typical day at work. decent work flow. foresperson is nice and easy to work with. i leaned about there package vehicle. one thing about the position that is hard for me is the shifts
good,"Hard work, casual conversation and security checks are the standard at ups. Management is great, and it doesn't take long to pick up a skill or two; however, workplace culture could use a bit of improvement. The hardest part of that job or any for that matter is commitment, and the heavy lifting of course. Lastly, the best part of it is the community for their teamwork and commitment to one another."
good,"good job working in a union environment.  Fast paced and physical at times, benefits and compensation package are very good.  Room for advancement in many areas."
good,"I made a few good buddies back in the warehouse and that made our days go b much quicker. But you still had to work Hard. Lots of guidelines and workplace rules that you had to learn, but once you did it was second nature."
good,I enjoy working with UPS.  There is little room for advancement if you do not have a degree.  The most would be a team lead position.  The work day goes by very quickly as everyone is busy.
good,"typical work day is not extremely long, dealing with employees which you will feel is like dealing with grown children.  I have learned a lot about the UPS system.  They do provided the supervisors with UPS work shirts."
good,"As a package handler, I worked around small-sorting parcels and extremely large packages weighing 100+ lbs. I suggest that if you need a good start-temporary part time job then go for UPS! "
good,people I worked with were great co-workers whom they taught me very much about how to handle clients and to give them proper responses.  this company gave me my experience to seek other employment with trust.
good,"Receiving inbound calls about complains with the customers package. I have learn to know the technique how to deal with irate costumers. Workplace culture was defintely okay and observant. The management was okay as well, well prepared. I cant remember a hardest part on my previous campaign, the enjoyable part is when we do activities."
good,"Typical day includes: interviewing, reviewing the applicant tracking system, tours, and I-9 system."
good,fast pace mail sort. sort done by zip code city and state. very physical and requires you to read city state and zip code at a fast moving past.  management work well with staff.
good,"A typical day at work was a fast paced 4-6 hours (with the exception of peak season where it would be a 10 hour shift) Monday to Friday with weekends off!  You'd think it's flexible, but attendance is taken seriously, and requesting and calling out is not an option.  Even more so if you are a young student with a social outside of work.  Management was tough and the pressure was constant as you had to load many packages in such a short time period, so there was immense stress from this job at times.  The hardest things about the job I already mentioned before this, but that's not to say the job didn't have positives.  The environment was rather friendly with the other workers being helpful if you needed assistance, and the job did give great benefits, ranging from health insurance, 401k, and annual raises."
good,Very fast pace at times and productive. Office work was stressful sometimes but the drivers was very easy. Working with management was stress sometimes
good,"I was hired in for Holiday help to load the trucks, my manager Matt, was awesome is a great guy, I would work for that guy again any day. He led a great team and we always had a good time, got the job done even when we were short handed."
good,"I learned a lot about working on a global platform and collaborating with others internationally. This was a great experience and allowed me to utilize my management skills."
good,Operations is highly micromanaged and highly centralized in authority leaving local management decisions tightly monitored. Customers have become secondary in place of profits and performance numbers
good,"Its very fast paced fun to work in , the people are great. Overtime is optional but during peak season its a must. This job you can get 30-40 hours of work"
good,I spent nearly three years here two of which were as a part-time supervisor. As an hourly employee there is a lot to put up with for little recognition but the work is fair.
good,I loved working at UPS. It has a great company culture and the people there were great. The only reason I would leave was for a family obligation. They treated me extremely well.
good,"Hot or cold warehouse, constantly working, never get a break, don't like fact you have to work for a year to get benefits. The pay is horrible for the work but most work for the benefits and have other jobs or are self employed. The hours, very early am, gibe you a chance to work elsewhere, take care of business affairs etc witbout having to take time off. Overall, for me its worth for the benefits and the hours that allow me to work another job and go to school."
good,It was a very Hands on job. Always working. Always standing on your feet. I never had a problem with that because I was there to work. Sometimes they asked me to be a helper on they trucks and I had no problem with that because I got to be out in the field.
good,Being reliable and consistent during this job can help you improve in many ways. I've found this company to be one of my favorite employers. UPS could give out chances to be hired but lack communication when it comes down to getting an interview.
good,"Typically I would check to see if there were any open issues, that may have been left open from my agents. Checked quality review scores. Consoled Technicians when they might of been having a hard time or something that may have been impacting their life inside and outside of work. Running site reports, answering questions, making sure agents were sticking to their work schedules, and if something may have happened, tried to help the agent resolve the issue. There were a couple times, when agents showed up to work in no where close to a working condition due to medical problems, and had I took agents to the hospital due to multiple different medical problem.I tried to do everything I possibly could, and if my supervisor requested I take on a new task, I had no problems in adjusting myself to assist the supervisor and trying to do everything I possibly could to assist the team/department/site/corporation out in anyway possible."
good,I know several people that work at UPS and its very competitive in pay and benefits. I was only temporary so I dont know a lot about sick time or vacation. Overall I enjoyed working the short time I did. It is very busy and hard work.
good,"The job is pretty easy to acquire but has some physical demand. The pay isn’t the best for the amount of work you feel your doing."
good,My job was loading trucks in the early morning hours.  The hours worked great for going to school. Health insurance and dental insurance is paid so that was great.
good,Every day at work is a hard physical day. The hardest part of the job is stocking up the trucks. Management was extremely young. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with UPS Team members.
good,"the job provides a good opportunity to learn how to work with others and rigorous time schedule and daily deadline. The hours vary during the year, an increase happens around the holidays at the end of the year."
good,"As I like the fast pace working, I love working at UPS. My supervisors are very understanding. Most of my co-workers are friendly. Everyone helps each other when needed."
good,The shift I worked was a bit hectic but the environment was safe. I learned people skills because there's a strong sense of comradory. Management did the best with what they had and the hardest part was probably moving irregs.
good,Overall a good job. Pay was good. Union wages. Relationship between management and the Union was always hostile with the employees caught in the middle. At the time most Union related jobs were similar.

good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar,boa convivência com colegas de trabalho, porém gerencia com pouca organização."
good,"UPS is based on a promote-from-within system. Get hired as driver, warehouse worker, or management intern, and then move up. Anyone can opt-in to apply for a management position. Its pretty easy to make it to supervisor and eventually to manager, but making it to director, VP, and above takes a combination of extremely hard work, visibility to upper management, and a bit of luck. "
good,Teamed with drivers' that had 15+ years experience. They knew how to get the job done and made working at UPS enjoyable. Pay was weekly and always on time.

good,Working at the UPS location that I work at can be very demanding. I takes a person with thick skin and a strong will to work at my  location. The opportunities can be limited.

good,It was a fun place to work and the staff was great also. I came in with many years of experience with UPS. The owner of the franchise was great to work with. The hardest part of the job was if  I was working alone and had  five or more customers walk in at the same time. Otherwise the job was enjoyable and made the days go by fast.
good,You really work for your money. They have great benefits. Its alot of wear and tear on your body over a while. Great job to work if your in school.Stay to yourself.
good,Hard work and pay is not great starting out but it balances out with getting school paid for and full benefits. There’s plenty of opportunities for advancement within the company though.
good,It was okay I had to drive far to about time o got there it was all work nice place to work at real friendly staff and. Co work's nice lunch room and lots of space
good,"This is the company for you.  Fast paced, quick advancement if you make the right choices, vacations are based on years of employment.  My day consists of managing facility mechanics and employees, managing inventory for parts and supplies, spearheading small jobs, and meeting with outside vendors or contractors to complete a task."
good,"This job is physically demanding. However it does pay off if you want to lose weight and make decent pay for a little while. Reading labels on packages and sorting them is difficult at first. But if you're willing to keep going, it will definitely become second nature."
good,"Procesos bien definidos dentro de la compañia."
good,There is a lot of room for advancement with good benefits. If you can handle the hours and the fast pace its a good place to work with good people to work with.
good,"very fast paced enviermnent, fixed  hours, lots  of  overtime during  Christmas , good benefits, stressful job , pays college tuition up to thirty thousands dollars , variety of different shifts , means  can work early  morning, or  late night  hours, or midday shift."
good,Typical day included loading and unloading all packages that came through on the belt. Depending on your job title you are either loading packages are moving packages according to their destination.
good,Very nice place to work. Always something new to learn. They keep you very busy in a safe work place. Feed back from the higher ups is common. And its not unusual to see management and higher on the ramp.
good,"Unfortunately the contract was over when I really got comfortable with the job. I had a really good chain of command and though it was really fast paced at times, the were really helpful."
good,It was a part time job only. If I made more money I would have not rejected the request to stay and would have stayed longer. I am on the call back list and still have good connections.
good,"Amazing people, Wonderful working attitude. Never a dull moment or a lack of something to learn. Family owned and operated makes for a fun winter rush every year."
good,"solid job to hold down if you need one while you find a better one, it is nitty gritty hard work and you dont get paid much, i enjoyed my time there but wouldnt go back."
good,You better be in shape and prepared to be dirty and pressed for time. Not a job for slackers. It is a lot of work to memorize what you need to know and to learn the device that you carry around
good,"Great people fun place to work, good exercise but hours leave a lot to be desired and you have to hound them to give you the raise that they promised."
good,The owner of The UPS Store that employs me is fantastic. She is great at training and making sure that we are equipped to handle all of our job tasks.
good,"UPS is a good company to work for in general. If you are working hard with integrity, there is nothing you need to worry about.Company treats employee fair and takes care of you when needed. "
good,very fast and heavy handed job pay was low but I'm not greedy. it was almost like going to the gym all day good news was I worked evenings and the cool time of the year
good,Fast pace very stressful but fun place to work if you know what u are doing. Good benefits and a lot of opportunities. Supervisors are friendly.
good,"Good place work at times, it was competitive job, fun people too work with, seemed as a safe environment! The pay was ok. I liked getting paid every week!"
good,UPS is a good company to work for but it's very hard to get hired FT. Driver positions are scarce and very few openings. PT position hours are not consistent.  You sometimes will get less than 15 hrs weekly.
good,Its a great part time job with good benefits. Its very physically demanding especially during the summer time as there is no air conditioning in the warehouse.
good,It's a good place to start your working career. I was disappointed in the lack of communication between management and how they set up the part-time employees schedule.
good,Must be quick and willing to work hard. Need to be strong and able to lift heavy packages. Not a job for everyone but the benefits are worth the pain.
good,"This job you have to be ready to work because the job is an workout , not only that they will pay for you schooling and will give you good benefits there"
good,Although great public company the management worker relationship was very hostile . The expected productivity level was too high for the work required.
good,"it was fun and stress free, on a typical day id get a call from the driver and agree to meet at a place and then id ride on the truck for the day delivering the packages"
good,"during my brief stint here i really didn't have too many problems the team seemed pretty motivated, and they were fairly competitive with the pay. the only thing that i had a problem with was one manager would harass me every once and awhile, but if i even opened my mouth to say anything he would ring me out"
good,"Can be stressful, very fast-paced. Drivers are well-compensated and start at the bottom before moving up. Driver helper position is very easy and keeps you busy."
good,"A day at work includes multi-tasking, fast pace, customer service and supervision.  I learned many things such as time management, working the operation and their system.  Management varies from being team player to not existing. The work culture is always fast paced and demanding.  The hardest part of the job is having to do an 8 hour job in 5 and half hours.  Their expectations are very high with no sort of acknowledgement.  The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people internally and externally.  Meeting new people and learning new things."
good,The company is old school and is struggling to change with the times cashing good people to leave the company for better opportunities. The culture has negatively changed over the last 10 years
good,the most enjoyable part of the job had a lot of fun and met new good people too. The job i was doing was really easy wasn't difficult or anything just basic
good,Was a fast moving job. Liked starting my day early in the morning. A lot of lifting involved but everyone was helpful in help was needed. I wouldn't have minded continuing the same hours
good,the job at ups was long days but very fast paced enjoyed it very much. my duties were to sort and organize packages as well as assist customer in the delivery of the packages.
good,"If you are willing to hustle, you will be a great fit for UPS.  It is a fast paced environment with a lot of hours available during peak seasons or times."
good,"Poor management skills , poor communication, lack of hours , lack of pay , too many job fees , unfair union fees , Very hot , a lot of drama, very basic"
good,"the job was not hard the hours were rough, but all in all it is a good company with  a fair wage. I somtimes were understaffed but other then that it was ok"
good,An overall enjoyable and rewarding work experience. Many new systems and practices to be learned but excellently mentored by team-mate. Good communications in place.
good,"Starting out the day with a breif stretch and team talk then we would start working 10 minutes after starting, loading boxes of all sizes into trailers."
good,"good place to work.  long hours, stressful.  mgmt. is conducive to excellence.  culture is one of deadlines, but teamwork.  most enjoyable is to accomplish."
good,"Anyone who likes to be active will enjoy the Pre-Load. Possibility for advancement is good. Outside of protective gear, no real dress code."
good,"Outside of management, the package handlers and drivers are taken care of, be it working opportunities, benefits, and career advancement.  Typical days at work are short, you learn plenty of information on delivery areas and procedures. Full time drivers work days are normally 6 to 10 hours, depending on workload."
good,"Fast-paced work, handling up to 1,500 packages a daily. Benefits are excellent and take up to 1 year to receive. Union members have your back and will advocate for you."
good,"A typical day at UPS, I start by reviewing with the Center Manager what is top priority to resolve for the day,review any open pending cases from the previous day to be resolved,monitor and resolve customer calls and complaint, monitor ans assist 150 service providers on road to get their parcels del with DOT hours. Working for UPS is fast paced and is always growing and training in logistics. I manage an assist  on average  150 service providers a day. the hardest pat of my job is not always satisfying the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is researching and investigating on the cusomer behalf."
good,"I learned a lot working at UPS, it was the perfect fit for my lifestyle. It was a tough job, very physically and mentally demanding. The overnight hours were difficult at first, but necessary. This job is meant for someone who needs a good part time job with benefits who has great charisma, and can work under pressure."
good,"Work consists of different workers all out to accomplish the same goal to complete the loading of customers packages while maintaining its integrity. Management is consistently helping in maintaining the work area safe and speedy. Almost all employees are great to work with, and of the same spectrum. Although, the work may become a bit stressful on the body, it allows potential for growth."
good,"For the short time that I worked at UPS as a Personal Vehicle Package Driver, I work with some awesome people and management was always pushing me to do my best. I enjoyed my time there and am glad to have met the people there."
good,"I would work in small sort section. That meant labeling the bags and putting them onto the conveyor belt. I learned how to work in very fast pace environment. Management was excellent. Co workers there are friendly and very helpful. I do not think there was anything had about this job.The most enjoyable part of this job, is getting a workout  while working."
good,Untrained management and very minimal break time. Stressful workplace with a depressing work environment. Building owner showed favorits and would not go by rules set by union. Union was also not there to back there employes slot.
good,Fun place to work in quiet environment with nice hospitality and hard workers. Overall the job was super easy just have to be fast paced and know how to read and sort
good,"Exposed to the weather conditions rain, sleet or snow. Fast paced hopping on and off of the delivery truck 150-200 times a day. Shift ended when everything on the truck was delivered for that day. I liked the job only wish they offered me another full-time job after the holiday season was over."
good,"It's a psychical, very fast paced work environment. Overall, it can be an excellent place to have a career with great benefits for yourself and your family."
good,Me personally the only thing i didnt like was the conditions when you're packing the trucks.I say that because i was working in the summer so it was very hot on the trucks.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Nice and understanding boss that worked with you. Fun team leader and easy to get along with. They gave good breaks and enjoyable place to work.
good,"A regular day of work would be to get signed into a scanner and they get assigned to a trailer and to start scanning and building a wall of packages. After we get our trailer caught up and keep the flow down we would then help anyone who is getting overwhelmed with packages, and then we would lastly lift in bulk which would usually be a lot. I learned about how the shipping process works and how many packages I could pack an hour, which was 415. My supervisors were very relaxed and motivating, but had high expectations which was good to help me push myself. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up when volume was at its peak of the holiday season and when I was in a trailer that is trying to keep up with a rapid speed of packages. The most enjoyable part was getting to work, exercise, and gain experience at the same time."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS Company. I liked the workplace, hours, and people there as well. I loved the hours because it fit my schedule and were flexible."
good,"I worked at UPS coming out of my freshman year of college. its a great part time job to have while in school, especially with the tuition reimbursement that the company offers on top of paih holidays and vacations"
good,"Its was the holiday season and all I wanted was a little extra cash. The pay in my opinion was good comparing to my previous job which only gave minimum wage there was not much I could complain about except the union taking $25 every week from every pay check. I was seasonal employee there was no need for their ""assistance' when I and half the building was going to be laid off after peak season. Some days Amazon prime buyers go wild and the're are thousands of packages coming to you none stop for hours. I am just going to say it's allot to maintain during the holiday time."
good,It was interesting to work for this company. A large group of seasonal worker were brought in to help with the holiday rush. We would load trailers meant to ship across country.
good,"UPS is a good company with even better benefits. Like every company though it had its ups and downs, such as temporary employment until hire on to union, everything to do with job placement had to go with seniority due to the union, but in turn was good pay, there was always work to be done, breaks and lunches where a flexible schedule."
good,"My day at way consists of boxes all day. I unload truck with thousands of boxes weighing from 5 to 140 pounds. Doing this every day teaches you to pace your self its a marathon, even though sometimes with the managers I help them out and clear the truck as fast as I can. As far as the hardest part of the job your first rail of the day(53-foot truck) but once you get halfway through the rest is a breeze. I enjoy most of the job is when I have my own truck to myself and I can listen to my music while I unload."
good,"Learned a lot about how to work hard and smart. Safety is a big priority, but speed is paramount. Massive pressure to work fast, and get the job done well. Those that don't meet expectations are pressured to leave, but the only ways to actually get let go is fighting or stealing, which happened more often than you would think. Culture is abrasive, almost toxic. However, you get paid well when you consider the benefits available to you."
good,"Working at UPS is a very interesting place to work during the months of October through January.  Better known as ""Peak Season.""  During this time it is crazy busy and really hectic! The other time of the year it is relatively a calm place to work."
good,"great job, very demanding.  Hard at Christmas time on the body and the family if you have one. friends your never replace!  Managers are tough for no reason most the time.  its not the military!!!  lols  lot of family still work there so i still here the story and the dirvorces!"
good,"While only a seasonal job, I greatly enjoyed the work. I felt very productive the entire workday. "
good,UPS was a good seasonal job to work over the holidays. Would be better if they offered permanent employment upon the completion of the seasonal hire position.
good,"I worked for UPS on three separate peak-season jobs. The first job was the hardest, but it allowed me to work with them again in the future. They have great seasonal work and usually recruit for full-time jobs afterward."
good,"The job can be stressful at times but it gives you the opportunity to get great exercise while getting paid to basically work out and load trailers. Supervisors are hit or miss, either you will love them or you will hate them."
good,"I hoped to be able to transition into a more permanent position with UPS while I am searching for a full-time job in my professional field. However, no positions were available in UPS at the time of this writing. Overall, I had a very positive experience working here"
good,Very fast passed going to different housed and getting out constantly to drop off packages and go on to the next to deliver a package to the next persons house
good,Great place to work especially during the holidays.  Peak season starts in November through early January. It's great pay for people looking for a second job.
good,Untied Parcel Services has flexible schudeles that will work with you and depending on your position will have weekends off. Good environment and also provides growth within the company.
good,"This job has the best benefits I've ever seen that requires only a valid Driver's license, clean background, and G.E.D."
good,"I liked working at UPS but as soon as I couldn't work as a data clerk anymore and was forced to load in the trucks, I couldn't see myself working for them anymore. not that it was hard being in the trucks, but the monotonous work of loading and unloading made me feel less than what I'm worth."
good,"typical day includes unloading semis, sorting packages, packing delivery cars. fast paced environment. coworkers aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. one of the hardest and face paced jobs that there is in the part time industry."
good,It is a great place to work and you can make a carrer out of it ups also gives alot of benifits that can help you in the ling run like 401K health n dental
good,My time at UPS was educational and fun. Aside from the lackluster way their management style changed over the years to be adverse towards the union worker I enjoyed my interaction with the people which made up for the harassment that we would have to endure from management on a daily basis. It built character to be able to go out and perform under extreme weather conditions and to brave Manhattan traffic on a daily basis.It was very challenging to avoid accidents among all the chaos of human and vehicular traffic.
good,"I've never worked somewhere that was so non-interactive. Even just chatting does not happen often. Not very collaborative, everyone seems to be holding onto their cards. Am told it is the strict delivery driver culture. Will have a hard time retaining millennials."
good,"I started young (18 yrs old) as a Part time Loader. I put my work in, went above and beyond, and learned other things. I helped people out when they needed it without asking. Advanced to Part time Supervisor (18-19 yrs old) as a result. The job is simple and requires little effort."
good,"Typical day involved processing shipping transactions for customers, sorting the mail, and packaging items for customers while following proper packaging guidelines."
good,"Although, I find my work at the UPS rewarding and worthwhile; I sometimes question whether I can do this job until retirement. As a Part-Time Supervisor that has worked for UPS for well over 8 years, I have been able to make lateral moves into different department, Human Resources, Safety, Revenue Recovery and as a Part Time Supervisor that works in the operation. The Union and the Management always seem to be at odds on what is correct; the only individuals that seem to be impacted the most from these disagreements are the Part Time Supervisors."
good,Fast pace job but unorganized sometimes rude management to many people working at one station never know where your posed to be placed at just alot of minor issues
good,"Hardest part of the job was mid way through the shift, work was non-stop. I learned how to juggle multiple tasks at a time with great effieciency. A typical day at work, you start up quickly and move boxes in their perspective places constantly. After about an hour you are given a 10 minute break then it's right back to the action until the shift ends."
good,"seasonal help at ups is good for holiday cash. even though it is fast paced, the people and managers are fun to work with.  if you are looking to get into ups then this will fit your goal"
good,"I would recommend.  I regret leaving UPS, employed for 22 years.  I started out in the loss prevention department, then to hangar site administrator, and last assignment was on the line serving as a liaison for mechanics/engineering and management."
good,This was a temporary Driver Helper position.  I worked in the mornings delivering packages by myself via golf cart and trailer in a big subdivision.  Later in the afternoon I went and delivered with the driver
good,Ups is a good family based environment to work in. They promote from within which is always a great plus in any work place. There are great opportunities at ups and they are even willing to help with school.
good,ups was a great please to work at. i worked inside as a package handler. my job duties was to measure and weight the packages and i also worked for them as a driver assistant.
good,UPS was a great company to work for prior to the company going public after everything changed became very cut throat only numbers mattered type of company which is understandable they now had stock holders to be accountable to but the work environment definitely changed for the worse
good,"Working at UPS provided me with the help in learning time management and pace. Working there, you had to be quick and try to minimize stress with the time being a limit and there was a plentiful amount of work. Overall, a really good job because of the educational assistance and benefits within."
good,"cada quien se dedicaba a su trabajo en exelencia pero cada quien en lo de cada departamento,"
good,This was one of two UPS stores that I worked in. I enjoyed the variety of things to do. The store I worked at in Las Vegas taught me more because I managed the store but did not have the Manager title. I especially liked doing the monthly reports and accounts payable at that store; I did not get to do those things at the Ceres store.
good,UPS is a very physical job.  You are constantly moving and lifting boxes that weigh between 5 and 100 lbs.  Working inside of truck trailers is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.
good,"It was a temporary job (seasonal). I had to meet the driver at a desired location , learned how to use the scanner for the packages. Deliver packages to the front door or in the hands of customer., had to be discreet and promo , time was of the essence because of workload of drivers."
good,"Hard work physically, mentally, and emotionally. I learned how to lift heavy objects safely.Some managers and supervisors were not employee friendly. The job is fast paced."
good,Always looking over your shoulder as management would make sure all employees were at their desk from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  Old school UPSers were much worse than the new school UPSers.
good,UPS  you work as a team   some time a certain area is more busy than others   so your coworkers help a lot. The work place culture is stressful at time.
good,During the winter months it is harder for drivers to get about with over filled trucks in the snow. I helped us the scanner guns and walked packages to the door for the drops. The diver's are nice and understand it is just seasonal. They really need the help before Christmas.
good,its ok I just worked there for one year.. the place was ok to work for and id go back if they were hiring again.. I liked the weekly pay that was the best thing about it
good,"Early morning job meeting aircraft and unloading/loading cargo. Job requires work in pre-dawn hours. Good to have the majority of the day free, but you must go to bed early to start at 3AM."
good,"As a seasonal driver helper it is most likely you do not do this work on a regular basics so your body  needs time to adjust to the pace, especially your knees due to the fact of the numerous times you'll be exiting the vehicle. Whatever the weather is outside at the time is the weather you will be working in. Seasonal work hours vary and after Thanksgiving your hours will get longer until the Christmas season is finished"
good,Not a bad place to work. Very fast pace work environment. Great benefits and can be a place where you can grow you career. Great place to work right out of high school.
good,"Wish it wasn't so physically and mentally taxing. Otherwise, a wonderful experience! "
good,Great job. Maybe not for everyone but definately a beneficial job. Pretty good pay and a lot of hard work put into the job. I would do it again but maybe not around the holidays this time.
good,"UPS is not for everyone. It’s a demanding industry thus market leaders, but as any other large corporation they try to achieve more with less resources."
good,Its a good work environment the only problems is I was making only 80 dollars a week and working 3 days and three hours when I was told I would work 4.
good,It's a great high quality fast work place management is always making sure that you are happy and they don't want you working when stressed out great Place
good,"I loved doing the job, being a UPS man. I was guy that everyone trusted and that brown uniform means a lot in the community. The biggest problem was that I worked late consistently and wasn't able to be home to see my young son before bed time or have dinner with my family. I felt like I just needed a change."
good,"Great company to work for.  Stretches your abilities and challenges you to always do better."
good,"It was a good start for me to learn how to communicate with people and also to stay in shape. The managers and drivers were nice, caring and willing to work with me."
good,"It's not a bad place to work if you don't mind manual labor, The pay could be better though. The hours worked with my class schedule, and the people working there are nice."
good,We Have An Amazing Staff With Great Positive Energy That Will Brighten Up Your Day And Instantly Put You In A Great Mood. The Food Is Amazing In The Area (Caribbean Food)
good,If you want a fast paced daily work out then package handling is perfect. My experience was in a cramped but efficient work place focused on safety above all.
good,fast paced non stop work  environment good manage ment good opportunities for advancement and good benefits fun place to work if you like working with your hands
good,Entreprise de livraison de très bonne qualité travaille en équipe
good,"Sorting packages onto different conveyor belts, continuously lifting packages up to 80lb for 3 consecutive hrs. Job is easy and not easy, you will memorize the conveyor belt system in about a week, but it's very physically demanding, it's hot, you sweat a lot, so you must drink lots of fluid to keep from dehydration.  People I work with are nice and very helpful; especially ones that has work there for a long time.  I can't really say anything negative about this job if you can handle the physical aspect of the job.  Great benefits if you can last a year, full health coverage for you, your wife and kids, tuition reimbursements."
good,"With E commerce, UPS revolves around consumers and businesses.  We knew when a new Harry Potter book came out or when everyone would send flowers to their moms for Mother's Day because it would be something to plan for.  Best thing was if you tried something new and it didn't work, you could try something different the next day without lasting difficulty."
good,"This was a nice seasonal job during the holidays. It was a fast paste environment, and you got to meet new faces everyday. Workload varied from day to day."
good,Typical day consists of being inside of a truck while hundreds of boxes come down a belt at a somewhat quick and fixed rate. Each loaders truck was there own to fill as tight as possible while controlling the flow.
good,"While working here you get to exercise. The staff are cool and down to earth people, easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job; handling packages. Cool place to work."
good,"In order to move up in the company you needed to come from operations, preferably a driver.  Management is very strict and allow little room for creativity"
good,"Fast paced job where you are expected to keep up. Management was super chill in my section, and generally helpful if needed. Not a bad situation as a seasonal job, although the pay could be better for what you're doing and the stress it puts on the body (depending on the day and season A LOT of heavy lifting."
good,Very good place to work with a competitive environment that always keeps you on your toes. Full time management is tough to get into and you may have to work part time for a while.
good,Very stable company and we are at an exciting stage of new influx of talents. I enjoyed working there and everyone there treat each other with respect
good,My time at UPS has been positive. I've been allowed to grow and implement changes as deemed necessary but there's a ceiling to that growth at my current position.
good,If you put in the time and effort at this job you will succeed. Overall you need to be both mentally and physically tough to stay at the job long term.
good,I really enjoyed my time at ups. I would prefer more flexible hours and option of choosing days off. If I had better transportation  ups would be the first job I chose.
good,"Lot of walking and pulling cart."
good,its a fun fast paced environment the drivers are nice. the warehouse work is tough and extremely fast paced but its worth the experience. ups is a great company with tons of roon for progression
good,After 4 years I just was unable to advance. Mainly due to Union seniority. I just needed more hours to be able to survive. Wish I could have afforded to stay.
good,It's a pretty good job to work for.You just have to want full time work that's all or you would want to drive the trucks.work is hard at first but then it gets easier.
good,"Job is very worth it, the only negative thing is the fact that you have to work in the warehouse for 1 year before you get benefits? The hours were decent (super early, rest of day to yourself), but the pay wasn't worth it at all. It's not hard work, but for the volume they receive, you'd think there would be a better system. . ."
good,"A typical day at UPS for the position of a sorter would be moving, lifting, and sliding packages to their correct location based off zip codes. "
good,"outside sales - work a lot by yourself but have to meet multiple goals. management will check on you, but support takes a lot of time to get."
good,"As a driver there very long days ,must be able to work in all types weather. Great customer service is a plus even under the stress of the day.  Management team overall can be over bearing due to the high pace and demands of meeting company and customers expectations ."
good,Being a driver helper for UPS was very simple. It entailed riding in a truck with the driver and getting out to carry packages to the perspective locations. The job paid very well but it was only a seasonal job so the hours were not very consistent and not very high.
good,"Although I had a few disagreements with management and other coworkers, my time at UPS was very motivating and inspiring.  First time working in the Engineering field. Learned tons."
good,"UPS is an good place to work but the management team sucks, They only out foe UPS they don't and wont try to understand work and family life. They talk to you any kind of way and then want you to go back to work like nothing happened."
good,Ups is a great job if you do not mind working outside in harsh conditions. The benefits are outstanding. I will say that being involved in your family's social life is very VERY hard and can take a toll on your marraige with the late hours and long strenuous days
good,"There is something exciting always going on in the logistics world. Each and every day bring about some type of change which keeps the job spiced up. The only bad part about being a part of the UPS management team is the work life. It is not designed for a person that has a family, especially a young family."
good,The job was helpful in paying off college debts and gaining experience. Balancing the expectations of customers both internal and external was a constant strain.  Left because my brother was undergoing heart surgery and was going to need assistance.
good,"Typical Day - Help load truck, help make deliveries."
good,This had to be one of the hardest jobs I've done it was a great place to work as a part-time although the pay did not make up for the hard work the benefits are great working for this company
good,"I delivered several packages to residences and companies, unloaded and loaded trucks, organized the truck to make it easier to complete the route and find the owner's packages."
good,Very well organized and high pace work environment. You are required to learn how to multi-task and stay on top of the things all the time. The hardest part of the job is to plan and prepare resources to go through peak season such as Xmas time while facing challenging weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is to put smiles on people's face each time when we deliver our commitments.
good,worker are nice and friendly... UPS provides training for the new worker.. the Human Resources is very approachable and friendly. drivers are cool and friendly too...
good,great place to build character. requires initiative as well as hard working individuals.  A great place to work and move up if there for a certain period .
good,"I loved my job and my team, my boss was so friendly and she always created a comfortable and friendly environment for staff and customers whether they were new or long term ones. Although i do want to start a family and plan my future but the ups store doesn't offer any kind of benefits."
good,"A typical day there you would be rotating with loading and unloading trucks, sorting packages, and working as a team. I learned the different types of deliveries. My belt manager was awesome as well as most there. the hardest part for me was lifting the real heavy packages to the high belts because I am short. I enjoyed meeting new people, challenging myself and showing others I can do what some doubted."
good,"Fast place to work at when delivering, i loved working here the coworkers was great and easy to work with. My position was only seasonal so i was unable to contine the job."
good,"They expect employees to do the impossible , loading trucks is very fast paced and usually messy. Very close corders. Also not all , but most supervisors are very rude and disrespectful. Other than the tyrant supervisors Its a great company."
good,"A typical day at work may involve you coming in early and working later than expected sometimes. Tours must be set up and interviews conducted to try to bring quality employees into the company. The management team is fair for the most part, but like any other job, they have their favorites when it comes to promotions. It can be hard to advance at times.The hardest part of the job is getting quality employees in and keeping them there. The fun part about the job is meeting people."
good,"It was a great time until the economy crashed, I don't have many complaints about UPS at all. Great benefits, reasonable hours. Advancement opportunity"
good,"The work environment at UPS is unsanitary for it's workers and harsh. employees are placed in trucks with no A/C during harsh conditions, and trailers filled with dust."
good,Must be willing to work long hours and work safe at all times while maintaining performance levels. Must be capable of following directions and have a strong work ethic.
good,A 100yr old company with great benefits and the peace of mind that comes with job security. Some departments are micromanaged while others are more liberal. It really depends on where someone's skills falls in the machine of UPS
good,"UPS was a great learning experience, it proved to me that I am not a 3rd shift kind of person. It also taught me that I would rather not have a factory job."
good,"I liked this job to an extent; i didn't like the fact that we had to deliver in any weather, snow, rain, etc. But other than that i cant really complain to much about the job."
good,Great benefits. Management is completely dependent on the integrity of individual. Little to no flexibility for family time. Understand you are viewed as a machine and not a person.
good,"I worked in the unloading section for a few months then bumped up to the sort isle for 1 dollar more an hour. You don't get many hours, however the benefits are worth the low hours. Its hard work, they will make you work very hard, and God forbid you miss work for anything, even with Dr.'s note and proof that you couldn't be there, they will still chew you out. That's probably the worst of it."
good,"I liked being a driver, the pay was good, the hours were too long. The job was a good one, although it was very hard work, and high chance of injury. I do appreciate UPS!"
good,"I've been a supervisor at UPS for 5 years, great company as well opportunities for advancement. The benefits are great especially for anyone looking for a part-time position."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at UPS. The Management at my hub is solid, I have no complaints. They start everyone out part time which is fine. For a part time job, the pay is pretty good. UPS is a great job for someone in college or fresh out of high school."
good,"The day starts with me doing pick ups from the UPS letter boxes in Edison, NJ. UPS has thought me how to drive safe. UPS management is second to none at doing their job.  Workplace culture at UPS could have its days, but overall its a good place to work at. Hardest part of the job is in the beginning when your trying to get used to the delivering job and it gets easy once you catch on. The most enjoyable part of the job as a Driver is getting to know the people as you deliver the packages."
good,"reach truck"
good,"Mad great money, liked my customers and management at the time that I worked there.Not sure if it's the same that was along time ago. Liked getting in my truck and being my own boss for the day. Was up to me to complete the route , no one else."
good,A typical day at ups was delivering pkgs to business and residents. I learned to load and unload trucks as well as serve customers with great customer service and a smile. Management was ok but could be alot better. Sometimes the time committed stops such as air could be a challenge to get delivered by committed time. The most enjoyable part was serving the customers.
good,I liked working for them because your on the go all day u interacting with people and getting to know your routes.The workers were friendly and very positive i never seen so many people like their job.
good,Good place to make some money while going to school. They help pay for school. They give opportunities for advancement but they don't seem to care about how much education one has which is one thing that bothers me.
good,"UPS is a very physical working environment, working at ups I have learned how to be more of a dependable and more of a team player. You have to be able to work as a team to get things done completely and on time."
good,Good work place. For the student that freshly graduated in his/her campus. Assisting and guiding the trainee to the objective or assignment that granted fir the trainee.
good,"My day Starts at 2pm pretty smooth, get daily reports, Dispatch the drivers, get concern done."
good,A day at UPS was very fast paced and usually successful. I learned how to work at a fast pace and how to stay focused. The management was above average. The hardest part of my job there was staying on track and not getting behind. The most enjoyable part was being active and seeing your success at the end of the shift.
good,whether you are a loader and/or driver the jobs will demand a lot of physical activity. These jobs are not office jobs and will require hard work. But the pay and benefits match the work.
good,Work is always interesting and challenging.  TIme on job is exciting.  No holidays off and work on weekend can be the cause for concern.  Opportunity for advancement.
good,very physical loading and unloading trucks the culture is mixed between ages but everyone is pretty nice the hardest part is the pace that you will have too keep up with
good,"This job is fast passed, well at least on the pre load side. Everything needs to be loaded before the drivers leave. Depending on staffing and volume things can get out of hand real fast."
good,"I've worked for UPS for 1 year now and I will say, I love my supervisor, most of the people I work with are awesome, but they definitely don't pay you enough for the injuries and stress you do to your body. "
good,"Working here was a great experience the fact that it was a new environment, a new state, interacting with different people with different mindset. But I also I had experience from working at a previous UPS branch in Brooklyn NY"
good,"When we get there to start your shift, the first thing the shift manager has everyone do is stretches to warm up the muscles. It is a very physical job to squat and lift packages. We stretch so we won't pull or strain muscles. We pick a truck trailer, move the conveyor belt as far in to the truck trailer as possible, and start placing packages onto the conveyor. After the truck trailer is empty we go to the next one."
good,Honestly people doesn't like getting paid the lowest amount while other companies are getting much more or less but have the best benefit. We lose people nearly every week
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the only thing that I found fault with was the fact that people in the office didn't know what was going on with different departments. I would call in to let them know I was done, to ask if there was another load being sent out, and they wouldn't know anything about it and would transfer me to someone else, wherein the same problem would occur. This happened almost every time I called in. I also didn't like the fact that they did not inform me of my final day until I called in on the following workday and was rudely informed that the Driver's Helpers were no longer working as of the last workday and hung up on."
good,Fast paced if don't like to work don't apply I spent 30 years basically loved it knees went ba decided to retire management can get under your skin  weather is a big factor
good,A typical day is loading hundreds to thousands of packages practicing safety methods. Management had there favorites which was not a good thing hardest part of the job was lifting packages over 100lbs most enjoyable thing was my coworkers.
good,The UPS Store was a challenging  but rewording place of employment.  I liked the customer relationships I was able to make during my employment.  I was able to advance in employment and still maintain a pretty flexible work schedule.
good,It is a good place to work. The people are great to work with. Third shift is really hard when balancing sleep and work. I work to take care of what comes in and out of my area.
good,I never got the opportunity to work for them full time. I would like nothing more than to be a great associate to work for this great company. I hope to one day get an opportunity. I hope whoever reads this will give me a call and a chance.
good,it was just a job to get by but it was easy to get in to a routine because it was the same duties every day. a little bit of hard work but not over powering
good,It was a very lucrative experience. The job never gave more than a 15 minute break though even after hours of lifting packages over 70 pounds. They also tried to cut our pay short sometimes so I had to keep track of my own hours.
good,"Great place to build a career. I've enjoyed my last 9+ years with UPS but I want a career change. As you move up in the company, the stress level drastically increases. 12+ hours days as management doesn't leave much time for family. However, the pay and benefits compensate for that lack if you are willing to dedicate yourself."
good,Very cold climate in Minnesota during the winter. It really was very brutal on my legs having to get in and out of the vehicle for as many packages as I had to deliver but the company pays well and has a good climate for employees.
good,"My job here was to package items, process items and load the UPS trailer. In this position I learned a lot about packaging and paying close attention to detail,which made me a fast handler. Using the computer to process orders and labeling taught me how to be persistent. This job was a great environment with good people who worked hard everyday. The hardest part of this position would simply be processing because sometimes orders get cancelled. My most enjoyable part was interacting with my coworkers and learning about different types of products everyday."
good,A decent job for anyone who is willing to do manual labor. Management is a hit or miss. Must have a fast work pace and be able to be on your feet. Co-workers can be amazing or dreadful.
good,"Working for UPS is a good job. Its a hard environment to work for. you have to work in extreme weather environments.  You'll never know when you have to work, or get off."
good,The company is great but not much room for growth! I think working on the retail side of the business is great as it gives you time to go to school after work.
good,This is a great place to work.  If hired full time it provide great benefits Not enough hours to survive off of.  So managers was stressed out and not available to ask questions.
good,I loved the company but at times some of the management got out of hand and it was looked over. If that had changed and I had not moved to another location then I'm sure I would still be w=ith the company
good,"This is a fast paced job. I work the first shift from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.. We either unloaded the trucks and put the packages onto the conveyor belt, scanned the packages or even sorted the packages out so they can go to the respective destination. It was also very competitive in a positive way."
good,Did what I had to do. I only started working there because I wanted the money. Yes I would recommend it to a friend if they are trying to get some good hours.
good,Not much of a chance for advancement for me at the time.  I had to locate another position with another company to find advancement at the time.  Overall good company to work for.
good,"Benefits are great, management depends on where you work (people make the job), hardest part of the job is waking up at 1 am for the peak season or perhaps starting at 11 pm the previous day and working until 7 am."
good,There are many jobs at UPS and a great part time job for a full time college student. Many opportunities to advance and learn skills. it gave me skills i couldn't have received anywhere else
good,I worked as a picker then a loader and it was a good physical job. I learned a lot about shipping packages and how it all works. I enjoyed a moving fast paced work environment.
good,A typical day at work begins at precisely 4:00 on the dot on the afternoon shift. I have learned a great deal while in my position and in such a short while. The biggest factor about this job is the teamwork that is involved in making sure that things run as smoothly as possible. The culture here is very good and the people I work with are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the physical nature that is involved but the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my co-workers.
good,the job was simple and decent. easy work and communication was good. staff was very informational and helpful. great place to build a career on if you have the time to wait for advancment
good,"There was never any communication between co-workers at UPS. Often times, people working for the same center would not know what the other person was trying to accomplish and it made the work environment much more difficult."
good,"Fast paced high volume job, Dealing with shipping and receiving all different types of packages through all weather conditions.  Team work is a vital to getting the job done."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS very much! the only probably i had was poor management of employees, most were laid of because management was not functioning properly."
good,"Ups taught Me some things, however i was there for only a season before leaving. Jobs there were usually for two members of the team per truck. you either have to load boxes onto a new  truck or unload them from a drop off truck. working here Taught me conflict resolution and leadership skills. as well as a good workout."
good,"I have been with this company for 7 years and not much has changed except for part time supervisors every other month. The pay is pretty good for my part time position and the work isn't as straining as that of the actual warehouse work. Management is terrible, everyone points fingers and blames one another. there is no teamwork. Given my position I don't have much to complain about it's really the higher ups that are pressured so much. My schedule is very flexible and I've taken a liking to it, other than the culture here."
good,It was good place to work. Supervisors were nice mostly had an attitude. Rushing to get the boxes into the truck some days were fun other days.some were rude cause of pressure of there managers.
good,Great benefits if you think you can keep up with their workplace environment. I'd return if it wasn't for the management at my particular workplace. thanks
good,Everyday coming into work was not bad. The work was a kind of challenging but the supervisors were even more challenging always on my back and it made the job harder the way they went about it
good,I genuinely can't give an honest opinion about this job because I worked as a temp during the holiday season.   The management was really cool and I couldn't complain.
good,"Poor work life balance, small profit margins, great training experience.  Exposed to all facets of business planning and financial acumen.  Tough culture."
good,"I literally only work here for the college reimbursement and the healthcare. Other than that this place isn't the best, but it is the best part time job in Louisville hands down when compared to the benefits that employees get."
good,"A typical day would start at 7am and end at approximately 6pm."
good,"Depending on location can have a great team and culture, otherwise tough job with minimal rewards, benefits are great! Great for business owners, students, or someone looking for extra cash during the week."
good,"•	Charger, décharger et déplacer des produits des produit et des matériaux, à la main ou a laide d’accessoires de manutention"
good,This was a tough job because little me was unloading packages off trucks placing them on a conveyor belt making sure the labels was faced up so they could be counted into system
good,God job learn how to load and unload trucks for out going and coming. Learn a lot from this job environment  is good for long term work for part time.
good,Great benefits! Very good pay when capped out. Being constantly active provides health benefits. Had quality managers! Enjoyed the relationships that were developed. Military like driving training was really good!
good,"As a driver helper, you are constantly on the road delivering packages. I think it's a good experience and not too bad for temporary work. The driver I worked for was very helpful and easygoing."
good,"A day at work is hectic, its full of boxes and its challenging. The management stays on your behind and get things done. The culture of the work place is pretty loud and fast. The hardest part of the job is mostly the people you deal with and the boxes never stop coming. The most enjoyable is when the work is finished its all love afterward, everyone gets along, barbecues and just have a blast."
good,"A typical day would be either training a new hire and showing him the ropes at ups. Showing him proper procedures as well as the appropriate form to load. The day goes by typically quick considering it was part time, however the poor management makes things problematic. Only a 15 minute break which isn't enough time to fully rest, the lack of air and heat is problematic. The workplace culture varies from bad to semi-decent depending on the work output or how much volume is being ran."
good,"i enjoyed the work, i didn't enjoy working nights though. there wasn't much of an option or flexibility when it came to hours. i really enjoyed the people i worked with and for. the work was a reasonable pace but there was fun competition with work mates."
good,A tough company to work for but benefits are very good. Long days of work especially in December. Employees are held to high standards and expected to complete all work every day.
good,"Nice company, with room to move up in positions. I learn plenty about the process of delivery and the drivers were pretty helpful. the only complaint i have in the amount of stress on your body."
good,"UPS provides excellent benefits to their employees and there is ample room for advancement. But you will earn every penny you get! They expect supervisors and managers to work 'until the job is done' and THEN some. I'm all for doing my job, but 70 hours per week, on average, is just too much if you have a family. (No overtime, don't get too excited)."
good,UPS supports you in your position. Educating you and providing assistance. ability to move about throughout the company to many locations. Although in most management positions you will be required to move.
good,"A good job overall, more into it that meets the eye. I love the people I work around and I've learned to have patience with a lot of things. the most hardest part about this job is learning to have patience with people of authority and your peers."
good,"I learned how to address customers issues through email. In return this provided me with better writing skills. "
good,"i enjoyed working here.  it was hard but the pay was good and as long as you did your job, you had no issues.  it was some division between union and management"
good,Great place to work as a college student.  Great benefits including College reinbursement for those seeking their degree.  Great as a second part time job if thats what you want.
good,Parcels are heavy at times and stop counts can make a very chaotic day. The time allowed to deliver these parcels are not always fair or realistic. Very fast paced job.
good,"Day is long and often stressful, but it keeps you active and fit.  Meeting new people is usually fun.  Biggest complaint is management.  They know we're well payed, and purposefully make it as hard for drivers to fall in line as possible."
good,"This was a part time position driving a fork lift, loading and unloading trucks.  I worked approx 25 hours per week on several shifts.  I took the job only for the medical, vision, and optical insurance."
good,"This job has a very crazy work environment. If you previously worked in a office I would not consider this job - as it's dirty, physically fast paced and can be brutal on the body."
good,"This job gave me a fantastic work ethic, and great people skills, because its hourly employees were part of a union. Once you crossed from the hourly threshold to management, It felt like you were left to your own devices to figure out the proper way to motivate employees to the basic parts of their job. I will say if you are goal oriented, you can definitely learn a lot, but it seems that a lot of people are written of and left by the way side. personally I flourished at UPS, until my direct manager, wouldn't work with me to find good solutions to problems. Instead, just pointed fingers, so nothing ever got accomplished."
good,Working as an OMS was interesting. Having to deal with customer support and trying to get the packages delivered to the customer. Ensuring packages are delivered promptly and safely.
good,Compensation is good but work life balance is poor. Also conference calls are extremely negative and non-productive. Company continues to grow and is moving forward well from a technology viewpoint.
good,"While working here I noticed a lot of employees loved the job and had been with the company for a long time.  Days can be long and stressful and sometimes feel like your are being overloaded with packages.  Depending on your supervisor, they help a lot getting you home the best they can and are working equally as hard as you are."
good,Very well respected company who care about their employees and great team work. Every body works together to do what needs to be done. The hours are great as well.
good,Management could not be so militaristic.  Wish they would not be so focused on number crunching and focus more on better work environment and safe driving atmosphere.
good,very good place to work but very stressful.  It is very detail oriented.  Errors are not permitted no matter the years worked. That was the hardest part.
good,Zamanla daha iyi olacagina inaniyorum fakat insanlarla tehditkar konusarak digil
good,load unload trucks. management had favorites. extreme working conditions with heat and cold heavy lifting. great benefits.
good,It was a typical seasonal job for the holidays. Learning everything was fast and easy and the driver was very nice. I do recommend this job if you want something different
good,A fun job. Sad to see it end. I was hoping the job would lead to something permanent but it did not. There was no sense of real appreciation for the job performance.
good,"They have a very good system down, that seems to be working for them. You have employees and managers that pull their own weight and others that dont,"
good,"This is a high stress environment, but the benefits are adequate. You work with a good group of people, but sometimes management's expectations are unclear or unrealistic."
good,"On a typical day I get a call after 6 am to determine if and where I'm working that day. I then go to meet the driver at their desired location."
good,UPS is a good company if your a hard worker. I start at 4 in the morning and go until the job is finished. You have to be very determined to make an impact or the job will seem very hard
good,Well come ready to work an work some more. Don't be afraid to get sweaty and dirty. And try to keep positive attitude. Be dressed for work dresses properly.
good,"Faced Paced, need to be able to adapt quickly to things out of your control as a supervisor.  Safety is number one priority. Focus on productions vs people. Compensation is low compared to the amount of work expected on daily basis."
good,"Typical day at work can vary from extremely slow to relatively fast paced with many things to accomplish before the day ends. The holidays we will see an increase in traffic of around 75%."
good,"Good job overall however it does lack work/life balance."
good,Other than during peak season there is a massive lack of hours. Other than that management was fairly understanding with personal situations.
good,"Maintained detail cleaning and sanitization throughout the facility"
good,"load and unloading aircraft containers, an also loading packages onto a freight trailer. Driving tugs to pull dollies to aircraft."
good,"The Work Is Not Hard The people There Are very nice i load trucks all day in a great work space . i can see myself there 10 years later. "
good,"Loud or unload truck"
good,"my experience at (Ups) was a great experience! I leared many things about the company. "
good,I love the job but the staff make the job a little more difficult than it really needs to be. Some of the supervisors will be on your back for no apparent reason and then when you get angry with them they try and send you home causing you to not have many hours on your paycheck. Although the work is great the staff have things they could definitely work on to make the job paradise.
good,"UPS is a great company.  In part time management Advancement depends solely on your direct manager and their needs, in certain centers. If you don't have someone in high places advocating for you then your chances of getting passed up is extremely high. Openings are already pre chosen before or if a job is posted. I did gain vast knowledge in  key areas that definitely makes me more productive and valuable to the workforce."
good,I have a wonderful boss and manager. I belong to a team that has fun and works hard. I am treated fairly and am proud to work under the auspices of a great company.
good,"I started out at UPS as Package handler in 2011 to 2013 have to say its very hard work and little pay but the benefits are excellent.The hours range to 3am-8:30am and during the holidays you can ask to be a Driver's helper, which can be a positive experience depending on your driver. As for the work envirement  at times your pressured to work fast like a robot and at times you get slammed with packags which you will be forced to set asid eso you can catch the rest coming off the conveyor belt. I recomend this job if you happen to go to school they will pay for classes."
good,Turn over rate is pretty high. If you can handle the management team changing their minds every other day. Having to change your work style along with it. Then you'll fit right in
good,fast pace moving around heavy machinery. sorting packages into the correct colored bins. the hardest part about the job is standing for ten hours. the most enjoyable  part of the job is the opportunity to grow quickly in the company.
good,Good work environment no pressure. The management treats you like family cold in warehouse but can wear whatever makes you comfortable.
good,"the benefits are good, management sometimes can work with or against you, but all in all you do your job and go home at the end of the day.  its a place to start your career and possibly advance,  this is a good start."
good,"It was great learning from highly experienced professionals."
good,It was  a better company to work for about 7 years ago. They still have good benefits but for the work they want you to perform may not be worth it. This is my opinion.
good,It wasn't as easy as it looks and its a real work out. But over all it was a great learning exsperiance.. And learned that the drivers care about their packages
good,Driver helper for christmas season. Delivered packages to house's in Costa Mesa area. Worked Monday thru. Saturday. 7 to 6.
good,was a great place to work. lots of fun. stayed busy but had a little fun too. always doing something. work with a lot of different people.
good,"Fast paced job, especially during the peak season. I would suggest being in shape to run the packages to the door. Also you will be carrying packages that are 50 plus pounds."
good,it was a nice company to work for.  i just didn't like the fact that you only work part time and that you only did the one job.  You didn't get to move around and learn or do other things.
good,UPS is a fast paced job that pushes you to succeed. I love working here but I just see no future. It is very difficult to advance in the company. I would love to make this my career but I just don't see it happening.
good,"UPS TeleServices is a standard tech support call center environment.  Not much can be said about it.  It is very vanilla, and generally runs right down the middle of every measurable scale, from salary, to job satisfaction, to management. If it were an ice-cream, it would be a generic tub of vanilla."
good,"In this area of work, you have to beprecise in what you are doing so that thou can meet the criteria for the job. I enjoyed myroutes and did what was asked of me to do."
good,"Hardest part of the job was that it was solely involving FMLA, medical leave doesn't always pertain to maternity you deal with very heart wrenching stories surrounding UPS  employees. But there is pride and privilege in assisting your fellow man through a difficult time in there lives. Very rewarding."
good,"It was a great experience to work with ups, and i had posibility to meet new people and learn a variety of skills that i will be able to use later on in life"
good,"Well organized and productive workdays. Very knowledgeable managers and co-workers. Always willing to assist each others if needed. Cross-training introduced me to other areas of tax expertise I was unfamiliar with, which in return increased my tax knowledge."
good,"De 5h a 8h du lundi au vendredi , ranger les colis dans les camion correspondant pratique avec le tapis roulant et plusieurs employée généreux"
good,"It's  was fun working there and the employees, supervisors and the entire management team are extremely supportive. They will let you know it's a lot of work but doesn't pay that much when you first start but as the years progress you see a big change in your pay. They also have great benefits."
good,This position required most workers to work outdoors in adverse weather conditions in which these environments made it somewhat difficult and challenging to work effectively.
good,great company. great benefits. based on your performance you have a chance to move up in this company and do things. the pay to start is low but if you stay with the company you will benefits.
good,"Blacks have no chance for advancement.  I worked with several black supervisors who hit the glass ceiling while their less qualified white co workers advanced,  great money if you are looking for a part time job with benefits."
good,I enjoyed working with my drivers. I would have enjoyed to work more hours. I would have loved to be able to stay with the company but the driver helper job is only temporary.
good,Ups has excellent employee benefits. They use to have great health insurance and paid vacations. They promote from within using seniority in the union.
good,"Have great benefits, but your hired as an part time employee and becoming full time to even more money is almost impossible...off on weekends and every holiday"
good,"Задержки з/п, переработки, не обоснованное давление со стороны руководства."
good,I was Seasonal for this job so I can't really say much but while I was employed the management and overall job was pleasant
good,UPS is a good place to work. Could use improvement.on machine safety and updated equipment. More Injury equipment should be available for instant use.
good,great company. great benefits. based on your performance you have a chance to move up in this company and do things. the pay to start is low but if you stay with the company you will benefits.
good,"united parcel service taught me a lot about working with others, controlling and maintaining energy levels, and taught me alot about money management. I wold highly recommend UPS as a beginers job, or just all around positive work environment for someone looking to grow and expand their experience."
good,"Being in management can have its ups and down. However, they do offer get benefits that will allow growth. The only thing that made the job hard was dealing with disgruntled employees and coworkers."
good,Great Co-Workers great benifits. Supervisors were good.  If I was offered to go back I would my co-workers were fun to be around and made you feel human.
good,"work hard and fast"
good,"Decent job not stressful, pay was okay. Typical day at work was a little hectic. Environment was clean and temperature controlled.I learnt to work more efficiently and accurately. Co-workers were awesome."
good,"Satisfying work and team for any entry level employee.  Always busy, and leave every day feeling like I accomplished something."
good,"This is a good company to work but I don't see further growth for myself."
good,UPS is a good company to begin at and I was fortunate enough to meet some great people here.  It is more so a self motivation type team that I was part of and the guidance was not really there so I did a lot of learning and creating contacts for myself to gain experience.  Most of my co-workers were great but the thing that was bothersome was the processes involved in the company.  Old legacy processes that delay needed updates or implementation at times.
good,handle inbound calls from ups freight customers. problem solve any issues they may have. data entry is a must. handling confidential information.
good,"While there's a lot to learn, it's REALLY necessary to learn guidelines and procedures there. Also, you have to learn to work fast, but decently. Just like any other job in retail, you are going to have pushy or horrible customers. So this requires a good deal of patience, being level-headed, and good with customer service. Communication is essential. I'm lucky to have worked with a good team, and the owner of the franchise I worked at, was great to work with also. I can't say it's the same for all other stores. I'm just lucky that I worked with a good team. Just prepare to have some thick skin, to do a lot of lifting, repetitive packing, taping, typing, and bending. You will move around  A LOT. This is not an easy job. You are taking care of other people's packages."
good,Love the job but need more time with family. The hours I work aren't convenient for me or my family. No way to change shifts would prefer to work over night or during the day
good,UPS is a great company very good compensation but very heavy work loads lots of overtime . Over managed not very flexible with employees . Good benefits and retirement plan
good,Its good excerise working at UPS listen to the safety rules and enjoy work its a good experience working there you meet lots of great teammates there.
good,UPS has very good benefits but is very physical job. The balance between home and work does not equal up in time spent. Advancement is done on seniority basis as it is a union job. Management however is not union.
good,"Working at UPS is fun because it is a fast pasted job.  Every day is pretty much the same thing, loading and unloading freight.  It's fun because you get you drive a forklift.  Some days can be more challenging than others but the management staff is always there to help.  Great place to work!"
good,"Es una gran empresa a nivel trasnacional preocupados por el serivicio al cliente y por su satisfaccion, se preocupan por sus empleados, incentivos, profesionales "
good,it is a very fast paced work enviorment but as long as you work hard you will do fine. just pay attention to where you are walking and taking packages.
good,"The job was great always kept busy with calls coming in but very stressful  My co-workers where the best, I mostly enjoyed the people I got to talk to."
good,Fast paced work environment. Must follow OSHA guidelines. Ability to advance. Pay is competitive. Consistent schedule to plan personal life
good,"I love the job and co-workers, I m great with customer service and overall position.  The downside is it is only part-time and pay is to low. I have learned the extensive shipping rules for UPS Store, international shipping rules, I have learned printing solutions and photo solutions, UPS Store offers a wide variety of services for customers, which I have learned and are still learning."
good,"Great pay and benefits, long hours, hard work, extreme work conditions, and great workout. Great coworkers. Great opportunities for building customer relationships."
good,"Em sua primeira expansão real no Brasil, participei em sua atividade nos ido de 1991 a 1995 na região de Ribeirão Preto e Franca, mais especificamente com escritório em Franca devido ao volume de documentos e amostras geridos das exportações de sapatos. Atuei administrativamente como franqueado exclusivo, e pude conquistar o mercado devido a minha prévia atuação na DHL. A oportunidade batia a porta, os clientes americanos necessitavam de um sistema de envios de amostras pontual e dai o mercado rapidamente absorveu os serviços da UPS por este fator. Com a vinda do REAL as exportações paralisaram e por falta de apoio econômico abandonei o Brasil."
good,"Great place to work, built lots of strong bonds with my co-workers.  Always plenty to do and learn.  UPS is willing to pay for additional education if the employee is willing."
good,"Hardest part of the job is the environment; working in a heated building during summer days"
good,"This was a very loud, hot, cold, high stress environment.  There were unrealistic goals set forth.  This was essentially an outdoor job, very little heat in the winter and very little air conditioning in the summer."
good,"Great benefits, early hours and lots of hard work. If you're willing to put in the work and work the early hours than this is the job for you."
good,"100,000+ volume would be a typical work day for me. While working with ups, I've learned how to develop myself into a hard working individual. Loading ups trucks would be the hardest position to be in, only because of the work flow with a heavy volume. What would be the most enjoyable during work? getting the job done."
good,UPS was a good company to work for. I leaned how the process of delivering a UPS package works. The management wasn't the greatest but the co workers were cool. I enjoyed moving around and giving God customer service
good,"Work at ups is pretty much like going to the gym with a trainer. Constant lifting, pulling, and sliding boxes until the morning hits. This is a pretty cool job if you don't mind getting sweaty. Money is good and you get paid weekly which is always a bonus."
good,"Specific JD."
good,"A typical day at UPS is that you are busy from the time you start until you end the day. You are in a trailer under hot or cold weather conditions, you load and scan packages. "
good,"On average we get about 150-200 packages for us to process and package. The co-workers are great and the management is a work in progress. I have learned how to package packages to UPS standards. The hardest part is the short hours and small amount of pay, however, the environment is great and we get a wide variety of people who come in the doors."
good,Working real hard. Bringing home money and taking care of your family. helping other from time to time. its always nice to give back.
good,"great workplace teaches the real effort of working hard for a living."
good,Working in shipping and small sorts one did not have much opportunity to interact with the management or other coworkers.  We stayed very busy and just worked.
good,"Working Environment "
good,Working at UPS is very different from working at other companies. It is such a fast paced job. Everyone is always focusing on what they have to do and since the job is non stop there is barely anytime to do anything but work. Once you get the jist of the job it becomes like second nature. Its a very good alternative to going to the gym. When people do have the time they will help you as best they can. The hardest part of the job is finding the correct pace so you don't tire yourself out throughout the shift. The managers try their best to get you help but since the job is union it can be very difficult at times to do so. The most enjoyable part of the day is break time when you're able to rest for a few and enjoy some time with some fellow co workers.
good,"I had an pretty awesome driver working the Bothell/Canyon Park route. I never paid for any of my food even when I offered, he never let me do more than what I could handle. I am an asthmatic with an arthritic knee from a past injury and he was more than understanding. We had fun on our routes, even named the truck Big Brown Love Machine (lol). We determined that the truck and brown uniform was irresistible. Anyway, the job can be a butt buster especially during inclement weather, but safety is always key so follow it. "
good,unloading and or sorting of packages by hand..moving at a fast safe manner ...safety was always instilled at ups..great benefits will just have to get use to working in a place of different climate change
good,"very great space to stay in shape, advance and also manage money while your in school. air conditioning could have been a lot better but otherwise it was great ."
good,"Working at UPS is rough at first, but with time one gets accustomed to the Warehouse position. You get stronger, you can work longer, but for a pittance. This is definitely a job that is great for students in High School, as most of my co-workers are. "
good,I was hired as a temp and the work required speed and agility.  The amount of packing required seemed excessive but they were understaffed at that time and I had to relocate for personal reasons.
good,Very exclusive for getting a real job. Worked through a temp service. The work was fun and easy but the job itself was a dead end with improvment such as promotion or pay raise seeing as there was no way to actually get hired.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that worked there.  The hardest part were the demand for increased work flow.
good,"While is started out as an hourly employee, I became a supervisor and held the job for over a decade.  The job was great with fair compensation and opportunity until restructuring after 2008.  Management employees became less compensated over time and opportunities became harder to obtain in the Phoenix, Arizona hub.  The hardest part of the job was to motivate union employees every day and consistently achieve higher demands of production.  I enjoyed UPS because of the stability of the job."
good,I process all international packages that come into the building. I key all packages in and I also make sure that all packages have correct paperwork for customs.I run all reports at the end of every night and make sure that every invoice has been imaged for customs. My co-workers are great! We all work together as a team to make sure everything is done right. I think the hardest part of the job is waiting for the drivers to come in to process the package and make the outgoing trucks on time.
good,"Great ! A Big Compagny where work, learn and progress, and offer the best of yourself."
good,pretty good place to work if your looking for part time work. If your young apply now. It would take you 5-10 years to be a full time driver
good,If your not able to work in fast pace environment then you will be able to work here. It can be overwhelming for anyone who is not use to this type of job.
good,"ambiente tranquillo"
good,"Easy typical day at work routine "
good,"Daily preparation for the work day requires analysis of service reports, dissemination of the information to the work group, coordination of daily required activities, and the ability to adjust to sudden changing conditions. The management personnel are skilled and receive extensive training and work in coordination to achieve business goals. The most difficult part of the job is the scheduling of required training and development activities to coincide with a fast-paced work environment. The most fulfilling part of the job is the sense of accomplishment derived from safely and productively completing the day's work."
good,"I love UPS but the work is very physical even as a part of Management, and the hours are long and odd. I have some of the best team members who have become friends. The best part of the job is knowing that you changed someones behavior to make them better."
good,The job does not pay enough for all of the hard work unless you are full-time which is a hard position to get. Not enough hours given to make money.
good,"A typical work day begin at 8am and end at 4pm. I learned organization and flexibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment,"
good,it can be a good career job if looking to become a driver. as a fulltime worker a lot of time is commited during the week. management is horrible and doesn't care about the workers.
good,"The UPS Store"
good,"A typical day at work includes being greeted by the morning drivers as I converse with each of them to learn their schedules and routes. My job was to manage and reroute the existing delivery routes into a more efficient on time and money system. My communication skills improved greatly during my time within this company. The hardest part was honestly the easiest, learning everyone's names. It was such a large company with many wonderful employees, it was hard to learn them all. But I was very familiar with faces."
good,"Good job to have and great benefits. Guaranteed work hours Monday thru Friday.  Fast paced with a lot of lifting, Keeps you physically fit."
good,the Francoise owner I currently work for isn't the best at management but other then a few little quirks its a good place to work.
good,Had fun on this job. My coworkers were cool. Although I had different routes in the Beginning. Once I was settled I enjoyed myself.
good,"The job is great, especially the hours. The only problem is management. Some hours come pretty early in the morning. But you get to wear what you'd like, unless you are a driver."
good,"UPS is great when you need free benefits for you, wife or husband, and children. It is also great when you get $5,250 a years to go to college. You workout working at UPS because of the fast paced environment, so no need for a gym. I am not a fan of the management because no matter how well you do your job it'll never be good enough for them. I dont recommend working at UPS to make a career but I would apply for UPS for the benefits and the college tuition help."
good,"Working at UPS is not for the faint of heart. It's a non stop job where you must be mentally nimble, physically active and thick skinned. You work very long days in all kinds of weather and deal with a variety of customers. You must be able to work independently and manage the daily challenges of your route. Even though you work alone you form great friendships with your co-workers. This is a union job so the wages and benefits are very good."
good,Fast pace from when u get there  always have to be moving.  learned how to used the diad and handle packages learned  how to  scan  load  and unload trucks. co works where good easy going lots of fun to be around.The hardest part of the job was the walking. The most enjoyable part of the job as the check i would get in the week
good,"Typical Day at work includes working with team members towards finishing the tasks for the current release plan."
good,"Enjoyed working here, for the most part. Very fast-paced, physical job. They only give you about 10 minutes worth of training before leaving you alone which means you learn by making some mistakes which is a little stressful with how fast-paced it is and how crucial it is to NOT make mistakes. But it is easy to learn what is expected and you should pick it up in no time. Met some nice co-workers, and you have time to chat a little during an occasional 10-minute break. UPS has good benefits but they don't kick in until you've worked there a year. I was basically a seasonal worker during peak season (Thanksgiving through Christmas). After the New Year, they were over-staffed and I was sent home sometimes without work."
good,The hours were tough. Hard work was okay. Manage was bad. Good pay great benefits I had advanced as far as I could I didn't want to be a driver for them.
good,This is a good job if you are still in school or trying to get help to pay for school. Everyday at UPS is busy. The people there are great and respectful.
good,"My co-workers are great to work with. We have a great relationship and are willing to help each other. Team work is always a plus at  work. "
good,"Coming in to the job, I wasn't aware of such short hours. The job is very strenuous with low pay. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter. As long as you keep moving, the cold won't bother you. Summertime have lots of water handy."
good,UPS is a great place to go if you've got nothing but time on your hands to work. This is where I hope to work again one day despite my questionable supervisors.
good,UPS was a fun job for me.  I enjoyed my co-worker and the work.  I enjoyed being outside and also interacting with our customers.  Unfortunately it was only a seasonal job.
good,"Workplace was always fun to be around. Other employees there ranged around the ages of 20-40s. However, management needs some work. Since employees are part of union there is a sense of superiority in workplace."
good,Management on twilight were very goal oriented and east to work with. Most Co workers are amazing and most experienced. During to peak season it appeared ups went on a hiring spree...HR needs to have stricter guidelines when hiring.
good,"I've been with UPS Freight T.L for about 8 months and they have been real good to me. They have some serious safety guidelines and quarterly training. They have weekly safety calls going over fleets progress. They work with you when emergencies arise without a hitch!"
good,"Buen ambiente, buena comunicación entre compañeros, trato bueno del jefe sobre los trabajadores"
good,"United Parcel Service Freight Truck Load division has been a good company to work for.  The training could be improved upon, and combining the multiple computer systems would be beneficial also."
good,"good place to get experience for future jobs.  good benefits for part time employees;diverse group of employees. varied hours, many locations; over all good place to work."
good,Job was good but as a new employee you do not make enough money to stay there. Start pay is HORRIBLE and the hours are hard to come by. Terminals are old and way outdated and the equipment is mostly old and ready for retirement.
good,"The UPS Store is an enjoyable place to work at while you're working on a degree. The management is very flexible with time required to attend school, as long as you keep a steady school schedule. There are many tasks that go along with this position, all which I have had a strong support of staff to help me learn in the time I've worked here. As a retail franchise store, there is not much room for moving up, thus I mention that it is a good job to have while you're attending school. Unfortunately, I have relocated to Westminster and the commute is not worth it anymore."
good,"I had a good experience working for UPS. They were very clear and reasonable with their expectations.  Though the opportunity for full time employment seems difficult to acquire, management provided useful feedback in order to constantly improve my skills.  People should also know that it is a very physical job and UPS does a wonderful job at emphasizing the importance of sleep, stretching and pace in order to optimize the performance of the ""industrial athlete."""
good,"As long as you are not at the bottom of the totem pole as a package handler the company is great. Union, good benefits and fair pay."
good,"A typical day of work is coming in, going over staffing, and assigning people to areas based on call offs. I learned how to manage time better, and multi-task."
good,"First time being in factory, it was different for me. I was definitely busy, never bored. Staff was friendly. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time."
good,very friendly people always willing to help you if need it always give your best effort when coming into work and you should have any problem a very nice and calm place to work
good,Loading Boxes into trucks from 3 to 80lbs we make sure that each box is placed in the correct shelf and in the right truck. Management is always on point. Co workers are great and the hard part is the physical labor that goes with the job.
good,While i wasnt dissatisfied with my working conditions i did feel like the factory needed better organization. Other than that everything else was fine. My supervisor was very professional and attentive. My co-workers were individuals from all over New York. We embraced each other like family and kept team morale high.
good,"UPS was a good place to work for part time, the pay was good. the staff was great, benefits were excellent. sometimes wasn't enough hours."
good,Fast pace work environment with low manager supervision. Good on connections with different companies. Allows you to move at your own working pace.
good,The UPS Store was a great workplace with laid back owners friendly customers and helping co workers. I enjoyed working here until ownership change ended in being laid off.
good,Would do reports for my supervisors to train employees.  Conference calls about safety daily and performance.  Train my supervisors and there employees how to be more productive.
good,A good job just wasn't enough pay to raise a family for that position.  Good people to work with.asdfhbsdklj fsasdasdfasas
good,A great position with a promise to someday become a Full-time driver.  A seniority based company that hires Cover drivers to fill in when the Full-Time drive takes a day off.  The Cover driver is used during peak season which is from Black Friday to about mid January.
good,"Shifts were always busy, trucks were alway full and Christmas was overtime, "
good,"Support enterprise strategy through account growth targeting sustained international growth. Work with operations, marketing, sales ops, industrial engineering and technical support to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,I helped prepare trucks for deliveries with organized and efficient loading of vehicles.  I learned how to use the scanning/tracking software to accurately track and move packages to destinations.
good,"My job basically involved working through people to achieve a desired outcome.  I was responsible for on the job training, safety training, OSHA compliance, payroll, production, quality of service, and managing processes and procedures."
good,"For a part-time shift, UPS gets their money out of you. You are payed well as far as entry level is concerned. "
good,"A typical work day at UPS was making sure that all the sites had their paperwork delivered on time so that the billing process can be completed at a timely manner with minimal errors. I've learned to be patient and how to work in a pace environment. My co-workers were easy going and fun to work with, we helped out one anther when needed.  The hardest part of the job was when the systems would go down and I would have to get with IT to make sure that the system was up and running.  The most enjoyable was learning new things and even though the IT part of the process was hard at times I did enjoy it because I learned new things from them."
good,fun place to work but no advancement. There is too much turn over but very stable work. It is very difficult to get to management to resolve issues. There are many things to do and sometimes there are food insentives for employees.
good,"the job was fine fun an a good experience fast pace environment an job, you have to be in shape. The management was friendly very helpful an determine to get the team of co workers all on the same pace, everyone had a positive attitude everyday as well."
good,"I've learned speed and accuracy on the job take you a long way in the manufacturing businesses, also showing that you are very dependable attracts."
good,"I go into work stretch my body before any lifting. I then set up my work station. I learned in order to make everyones day easier, people have to work together. The management treated everyone equality."
good,"Intense work, but compensation is worth it. Benefits besides earn and learn don't start soon enough, but for part-time work, the benefits you'll eventually receive are amazing. "
good,"UPS is a good company to work for as long as you can fit within their extremely conservative policies and rules. This company is 108 years old and acts like it when it comes to attire and grooming."
good,"it is a good work place but not enough hours or pay for the amount of work, they have really good benefits as well, fun environment to work in if you love to sweat."
good,ups is a good company you are paid well but they want blood for that  they are alwys pushing for more at my age iam looking for somthing a bit eaisier.
good,very little work life balance.  Great opportunity for managing people in a fast paced environment.  Work day is 6 am to 8 pm mon-sat
good,One enjoyable part of working for this company was meeting some co-workers turned into friendships. The other positive was learning the insides of a major company and how it operates. Lastly being part of a company that takes customer service to a degree that I can appreciate on a personal  level.
good,Nice place to work at. Lots of hours on the table if you are a go getter and want them. Not much to complain about. Lots of chance to move up if you want to.
good,"Great place to work, wonderful benefits. Pay is standard for customer service. not huge on personally growths. Number of favoritism's shown."
good,It depends on where you work in order to make it a fun place to work at. Other than that you should enjoy your time based on your driver. New experience. Nice networking
good,i loved the job i just hated the carelessness of other people products and that 3 second rule (where you have 3 seconds to identify where the label is and face its upwards on the conveyor belt.
good,Great pay and insurance but hard to advance within the company.  There was a lot of variety in what I did each day ranging from monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting.
good,"ups is a fast past organization that until i worked there i really found a real appreciation for what this company does for the public. it is not easy some days and others can really make you wana ask yourself why you chose that job. behind the scene ups handles so much business i don""t know how the world would survive without them."
good,The owner is super nice. She understand the customers. The only thing I don't like is that there are 3 workers and we don't take shifts during the month to work Saturdays. Also I don't have any design jobs there.
good,"Great job for the holiday season, fair compensation, coworkers are decent (depends on the day), management is okay but there could be improvement."
good,The hours were very flexible and the on the job training was very easy to learn.  Very fast paced work delivering packages.  The pay was very good for a seasonal job.  Co-workers were very friendly and knowledgeable.  The hardest part was getting used to the very fast pace that the delivery drivers work at.
good,"Ups is a fast pace work environment depending on the location, which is what I prefer. If there was a little more organization it would run a lot smoother in my opinion. Over all the managers etc.. are wonderful!"
good,Never enough coverage during off-peak times and you run up your hours trying to perform at the high standard expected.  They need to have more coverage on routes.
good,"taking back to back calls. You don't really get a breather between calls. Manager, supervisors and advisers are all friendly. "
good,Typical day was dispatching. I learned how to have speed alone with accuracy a very important function for that position.Great working environment among employee and management. The hardest part of the job was the quick turn over. What I most enjoy was the interaction with the Drivers?
good,when you have all the resources you need it would be a good day at work. Management end up taking on a lot more than the job description a lot of the time.
good,My days at UPS consisted of pulling packages off a conveyor belt and organizing them into their assigned delivery trucks. It can be physically and mentally challenging for those not prepared for it. The key to being a successful package handler is time management and organizational skills. Take too much time to load your truck and you get backed up. The coworkers I had at the time were very nice and assisted me when I asked for help. Overall a good company to work for.
good,The job was in a very fast pace call center type environment in which the atmosphere was pretty driven and towards providing excellent customer service.
good,"4 am start work off at 8am"
good,Lots of exercise. The drivers are cool. The managers not so much. You should probably be fit before applying here because if you are too slow they will fire you. I've seen it mayne.
good,"This was my first job ever and it did a really good job of setting me up for adult life, although I was only able to work there for roughly a month due to it being seasonal."
good,Everyday would be the set your scanner same go in get your scanner and start loading. Heavy Lifting and well sorting required .
good,"Show up, hustle and you will go far with UPS.  Holiday/peak season is always very busy.  Don't quit.  Your body will get used to the physicality of this job."
good,Fast paced workplace. Lots going on. Only A seasonal worker. would love to be a driver. Helper coordinator I was in charge of driver helpers.
good,"a typical day at work is challenging but rewarding"
good,"Gostei de Trabalhar na empresa, me proporciono boa experiencia e sua lealdade  muito exemplar."
good,"Being a part time employee, my hours were constant and continuous. the labor was hard but I didn't mind the work out of lifting packages. I received education reimbursement and by far the best insurance benefits out of every company i have worked or heard of. basically $10 co pay on everything"
good,I have learned so much from my years at UPS. I have gained exceptional management skills. I have learned how to train and think critically. UPS is a great company.
good,"not really much to say, same ppl same boxes everyday, i clock in, do my job, and then clock out. my co workers are good, and we all keep the ball rolling."
good,When you work for UPS you arrive early and get right to work. you unload and move a high amount of packages and must be accurate with placement. There is little time for socializing during working hours but a lot of good hardworking people
good,Good benefits and work hours. Only real problem was favoritism with management. Other than that overall good place to work. Very employee driven employer. Having weekend and holidays off was nice.
good,"I would sign in, hop into a truck, and begin stacking boxes accordingly. Most days were busy and physically challenging. Overtime during holiday season was very tiring but rewarding. UPS gave me a better understanding of multi-tasking and heavy workloads."
good,The typical day for a driver helper for UPS. You will deliver a lot of packages. At the end of day you will pick-up packages for different companies.
good,"Delivered packages during Christmas holiday season.  Good pay, and great guy to work with (driver) but it was only seasonal work. No opportunity for advancement or long term employment."
good,"If you obey the rules, work hard & go to school you will go far and be successful.  Management and employees work much overtime & it is hard on family life."
good,"fast paste, good workout, great company to work for, management takes care of employees, chances to advance weekly paycheck, and good benefits."
good,"Working in the UPS warehouse was a very physically demanding job.  They offer good benefits and a good pay rate. Though it can be argued that the job isn't worth the amount you get paid. They do ensure that their workers get a raise. Though it can be argued that the job isn't worth the amount you get paid. Job is very physically demanding, so physically demanding that most people don't stay there. But in the long run it's worth it."
good,"When I first began working at Ups my hourly pay was $8.50, and after 6 months I was making $11.00 an hr. Now starting pay is $10.00 for part - time, and I think it tops out at $14.00 an hr. It's really hard work but you get raises at a rapid pace. I had to leave though because I kept getting hurt."
good,A great place to start off at. Teaches you great work ethic at a young age. Small staff so everyone pretty much knows and gets along with everyone.
good,"Começava por preparar material de trabalho para as diversas funcionalidades e postos  de trabalho , foram me fornecidas todas as formaçoes para  e tempo para aprendizagem e trabalho , bom relacionamneto com todos os colaboradores mesmo de grau de administraçao , bons laços de amizade com alguns colegas e chefias desde nos tratarmos todos por TU . , sem diferenças .bom ambiente de trabalho , que se misturava com o stress e falta de tempo por vezes para os objetivos diarios ."
good,I work and handle packages for four hours. I learn just to move a brisk pace. management is okay they aren't the best. nothing is really too hard unless you over think it. just being able to work and go to school is enough enjoyment for me
good,"early morning hrs. good work ethics, caring management team the most important part about this job is they're always there for you and willing to help you out."
good,"Aprendi a lidar com clientes de todos os tipos, fazer amizade dentro e fora da empresa, ver as pessoas de outro jeito, verificar quem quer te derrubar"
good,"UPS was a great place to work. The work was challenging at times, but rewarding. I loaded semi trailers at night. At the time the location I worked at was the center of UPS's North American ground operation. It was a very interesting facility."
good,I would get there at 5 in the afternoon and start loading or unloading packages after scanning them depending on wat was needed. i learned a lot of zip codes.my co-workers were easy to get along with. I liked peak season because of the overtime and also the annual raises.
good,"It was a great location to work in the Coral Gables area. Work can vary from day to day, from being slow to becoming very fast paced within a matter of seconds. It can become too routine at times and the pay rate is not great and forget about advancing in the company is pretty much a dream because after manager comes owner so there really is no opportunity as far as that goes."
good,"A typical day at work would start by getting an order to be picked for shipment."
good,"A typical day at the UPS Store starts by sorting mail and logging in packages that arrive for mailbox holders, followed by the usual daily tasks such as shipping, packing, printing, copying, faxing, taking passport photos, opening mailboxes, binding books, and if you are a notary public, then notarizing documents. The Management here is good; the owner is fun to work with and laid-back but if you get lazy don't expect to be working here much longer. This is a fast paced environment and employees will need to be able to multi task with a smile on. The most difficult part about working at the UPS Store is getting past the 90 training. I hope you soak information up like a sponge because you will be learning many, many new things. If you like working with a team and enjoy a fast-pace, upbeat job then the UPS Store is for you."
good,"Waking up early to basically get paid to work out and get a huge job done not only for the company but for people across the world was remarkable. I learned that the little thing do matter and affects the outcome. Management was great, they would always come by to see how the job was coming along, helping you out and keeping the line up to pace so that we all get home on time. Co-workers were friendly and made sure that everyone loaded their trucks accordingly. Hardest part of the job was making sure your  area was free of boxes because they came by so fast. Most enjoyable part would have to be   finishing off the day knowing you made a difference from all the sweat and heavy lifting."
good,"* typically in a day in UPS customers will contact the CS team to book a pick-up and delivery of packages (anywhere in the world), the courier team will them have it scheduled for both pick-up and delivery. UPS is very strict with regards to promises so if they promised to have a particular parcel delivered by 12 noon the whole UPS team has to ensure that the package is delivered by then, or earlier."
good,Your just a number. So dont keep all your eggs in one basket! i worked for 2 years for this company never missed a day and was laid off.
good,"I would have to wake up and be on-time to work around 3:00 am working till 9 or 10 o'clock. Lifting boxes, packages, and invoices that ranged in weight (up to 70 lbs.) It was a friendly, helpful, and understanding work environment, and i enjoyed the learning experience."
good,"I learned different things at this store. How to bind books, stapling books, and setting up a copier for different types of copying,"
good,"Train new employees in audit methodologies and safe work habits as required."
good,The hardest part of the day working at UPS is the deliveries. You have a truck full of boxes which you must deliver them all.
good,"Work overnight. Very labor job I loved it. Always on my feet, everyone worked as a team. I enjoyed having a labor job. I was promoted to supervisor but the pay was not good at all."
good,good job handling packages to the correct trucks hardest part is waking up a 3am great people to work with is the best part but ears before you can move up in the company.
good,Just started here not too long ago I need a longer period of time here to give a more detailed response. however so far all is well
good,Manager meetings to start the workday to go over everything expected during the day.  Then we go to assigned areas getting everything set up and once the day begins employees begin unloading and loading trucks and the supervisors make sure all regulations are followed.
good,"The drivers helper position is a good one. Not for the faint of heart, really have to be motivated and work driven. To each's own"
good,"it's very phsyical but more physical depending on position you start on. if you think your up to the the physical aspect of the job and don't mind getting paid pennies, then starting at the bottom is not a problem. but otherwise it's best to try to be a driver at ups and nothing else. everything else is extremely labor intensive and pays you barely enough to eat and drive. they do offer the opportunity to move up in ups quite quickly though if you prove to be a hard worker. the drivers at ups are paid well so if you are looking for a good paying job and have to start at the bottom at least there's opportunity. the hardest part of the job of course is the labor, the most enjoyable part of the job was the adrenaline that comes from the hard labor if your an adrenaline junkie. i enjoyed everyone i worked with while working at UPS but thats probably cause i was to tired to hate anyone lol. there's no real drama because it feels like your just trying to go go go all the time. the management were good people when i worked there, they always lent a hand and tried their best."
good,Great people to work with and all work as a team. They have great perks and discounts to multiple location.
good,"A typical at ups is morning like getting to work out, I would get up early at 3:00 am be there for 4:30 am ready to unload and get to work."
good,Day to day the activities were the same. We delivered packages to commercial and residential buildings but it was an easy going job.
good,"Expect to work hard, stand on you feet most of the day and deal with cold weather."
good,"A typical day at work is nothing more than me alternating between unloading trucks and scanning the packages that being unloaded. On rare occasions they may send me upstairs to sort small packages and envelopes. They hardest part of the job is when we have trucks get to the facility late. In the time that we wait for those trucks, the supervisors either send people home or to other parts of the warehouse to prevent the company from paying us when we aren't working. When the trucks finally arrive we are down to a limited number of people and the supervisors still expect us to get all the work done before the delivery drivers leave. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is the experience with my co-workers."
good,"I've worked for UPS for almost ten years now and have done most of the warehouse jobs available. My favorite job there is being the Hazmat First Responder where I'm in charge of taking care of hazardous material incidents. It's a job that you don't learn over night and you earn a good deal of respect from management and fellow employees. "
good,Working at UPS delivering packages has been a physically demanding job. It requires someone willing to run around all day with short breaks. The hours are long usually 8 -12 hours especially during peak season (November - January). But its all worth it when you get paid.
good,I enjoy working at UPS. It is giving me great work experience.
good,"Its fun to travel out if the area for work knowing you will b home in 2-3 days. Work at this company was only half the week, & the other half you were enjoying your days off.  Starting pay was ok, but it only gets couple cents better by the year. I was there fiver years to finally see some good money."
good,I believe that UPS is a great place to work. The pay is great and the amount of possible hours really makes the job better.
good,"good if you do what your supposed to and follow simple rules, A LOT to learn though but simple once you get used to it it'll be easy."
good,"Go in realx and stay observant of everything around me and do my rounds every 45 minutes, while checking out drivers according to schedules."
good,"Seasonal Work helping UPS deliver packages to area residents and businesses.  Typical day involves sitting in truck executing ""stops"" of package deliveries.  It's fun and friendly.  Customers are always polite and in a receptive mood.  Coworkers are knowledgeable about other areas of the company if you are inclined to move positions. Strong culture(s)."
good,"Work hard and gain the benefits"
good,I would preload several trucks and was a backup delivery driver. Most of my coworkers were easy to work with and worked well with me. I always prided myself in doing the best job that I could and make the drivers day easier with how I loaded their trucks. Most drivers liked to see me loading their trucks and often told me how much they appreciated what I did and the communication I maintained with them as to where the stops were loaded on the truck. The hardest part was the fast pace during Christmas season and the trying to keep up with the flow while maintain the best work I could for the drivers. The respect that the drivers gave me meant a lot to me.
good,I have a few things i learn and that s to never to be late always do your best in any and everything you do also i learn your speed tell you a'lot about yourself. well i hardest job was to keep u with the boxes coming of the line and stacking them so they wont down on you well i just enjoy being a part ups family.
good,"A ""typical"" day is ideal for efficiency as submission of forms is under a time constraint before aircraft arrivals (four hours prior to arrival).  However, weather and mechanical delays greatly affect all operations and require adjusting procedures accordingly.  Working for a large corporation for the last 15 years has been a real eye opener.  I grew up in a family owned business who valued their employees with management that were able to step into positions if necessary.  Current management maintains that knowing a job is not important, only who can do the job and that an employee can be replaced at any time.   My co-workers are a wonderful mix of ethnic cultures providing knowledge in different practices and delicious dishes at our occasional potlatchs."
good,UPS is a High pace work environment with more rules than boxes. Working there you have to be  prepare to sweat and motivate yourself or you will surely drown in you work.
good,"its hard work but not for the experienced laborer."
good,"I started out with the original company that opened the call center and UPS was our client.  Things got a lot better as far as compensation and the whole benefit package when UPS bought us and took over.  "
good,"a typical day at work is just like any other day at work new people so  "
good,"Pays lower than the average factory job.  Got laid off so there wasn't much security, no one ever prepared us that it was coming.  Work environment was fair and managers were cool as long as you did what you were supposed to.  Employee Benefits were awesome tho."
good,"saisie des dossiers douane"
good,loading and unloading trailers. reading load numbers to get the package to right trailer. dirty when it comes to dust environments.
good,"I love this job. I love meeting new people and helping them to solve shipping, office and packaging problems."
good,I really enjoy the being outside the constant going. After 32 years I would like to work close to home and not take the hour or more commute every morning.
good,Overall a great place to work at if you can deal with a fast paced work environment.  Production goals at UPS are strong and require management to encourage employees to reach their full potential.
good,"Fast paced job, always busy but fun and productive. Worked with many people, get to know a lot of people."
good,I have learned a lot in my time at ups. I learned how to operate a business and hold employees accountable to company standards. I have learned how to be a good trainer.
good,you get no time to yourself except on the weekends and your are basically working 12 hour shifts
good,"A typical day as a UPS manager, you arrive to the office at 6:00 am and get ready for a flurry of conference calls to review your previous days results.  You dispatch your drivers at around 8:45 and begin to work on process improvements for the rest of the day such as, dispatch improvements to reduce miles and improve performance, go out on area and observe drivers to ensure they are following proper safety guidelines and delivering world class service, and deal with any customer issues that may arise.  Your day ends around 5:00pm."
good,"UPS has good benefits and is a stable company."
good,"My daily work is to attend to all email requests from different country and prioritize those that requires further investigation before possible resolution is provided. Analyzing every issues/disputes must be handled diligently as it impact the collections and revenues of the company and of the country if incorrect advised is given. The management team and colleagues are all very supportive when ask for help. Only extending beyond the normal time is the hardest side that I could see. On the daily basis, it is actually enjoyable because I love my job."
good,Work as a lead the work is typical sometimes we have late trucks
good,"Supervisor"
good,UPS was a challenging workplace that made you use your brain and physical strength to process packages for prompt delivery in a team work orientated environment. Being a First Responder I was trained to respond and process damaged or leaking hazards while ensuring the safety of my fellow employees. While at UPS I learned to work as a team and pay close attention to detail while being dedicated to working safe. The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect of loading feeders ranging in length from 30 to 40 feet in varying weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of my time at UPS was the satisfaction of knowing our customers were given no less than 100% of our attention and care.
good,"Fast paced, long hours, respectful,union type environment."
good,UPS doesn't really pay very much but they do have an immaculate tuition-reimbursement program. The work isn't fun or fulfilling but the people you meet there are great.
good,"es una compañia  muy extricta en cuestion de llegar siempre a las metas o objetivos  planeados ,"
good,"time is of an essence here, and being prompt with information and task in a plus."
good,"A UPSco é uma empresa que faz parte do grupo UPS, cultura padrão americano e muito rigida com controle de informações e serviços prestados, muito bom para vivência e troca de informações internacionais."
good,"A typical work day for me, is watching and managing the my belt. Make sure the trucks are loaded properly, make sure the belt stay clear, and make sure it doesn't get backed up. Make sure the customers packages isn't broking or damaged. "
good,"A typical day at work was always plenty to do,"
good,"It was an good job i learned how to ship, load and package items for customers.. my co-workers were awesome and they taught me well for when i need help."
good,"The benefit packages are amazing:"
good,"Worked with a great group of people. Learned how to provide customer service over the phone in a professional manner. Met very interesting and professional people, that I miss working with."
good,"I helped the package delivery driver with package delivery. It was a lot of walking and lifting, which leaves you a bit sweaty and toned. The driver I helped was nice but yet tough, but we worked well together."
good,My Co-workers was so helpful and nice. I love my Co-workers and i wouldnt mind working with them again.
good,"A friendly work environment, wasnt extremely difficult work if you were fit and could move packages at a quick pace. I only worked seasonal but I did enjoy the people and the job"
good,good company but they closed temp job hard working packing forklift driver pulling order picking order scanning
good,"- All staff are friendly and helpful"
good,customer service is a must as you process all in and out going mail while working the computer register.
good,"A typical day at work for me seems very repetitious. I have learned to be very detailed in my current investigative position.  Management seems really relaxed and tends to not focus on the important aspects of the job such as quality and focuses more on the numbers. My co-workers are great, they make the day go by without a glitch.  There is nothing hard about my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is hitting my goals, going above and beyond and reaping the benefits of my bonus"
good,A typical day at work for me ran quite smoothly & functionally. The store was very organized which made it easy to perform the daily duties & tasks. The associates were very well trained & informed in all aspects of the many services offered. After being there almost 7 years I didn't really find anything hard about the job. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to have the opportunity to pack & ship some very unique items & getting to know each one of my customers.
good,"Sorting packages by zip code into bags is fun, and the shift from 7:00 to 9:30 is easy to work with.  Lots of physical exercise and helping co-workers with their jobs."
good,Great company to work for with a strong cultrure on the UPS Founders and their legacy.
good,UPS is a great company to work for over many years. Build family-like relationships with co-workers. Stressful at times and usually work on holidays.
good,"Working for UPS for the past few years has taught me a lot. As a manager I have improved my ability to multitask and think on my feet.  It has taught me time management and professionalism as well. Aside from just skills, my job has taught me the ins and outs of the company and the vast amounts of different types of jobs that this company provides. I have always enjoyed working for my supervisors and working alongside my coworkers."
good,Great job. You will work with alot of great people. If you decide to go into management you will learn alot. UPS isn't just a job its an experience.
good,this job was fun but a person would work full time hours and only be considered part time.
good,"Receive incoming inventory into the system to be processed futher, making sure that all is accounted for in the warehouse. I have learnt the importance of maintaining error free inventory, which makes it easier for processing inventory throughout the complete stages from receiving to shipping inventory to various locations."
good,"was busy sorting christmas orders and loading them. "
good,"UPS has gone down in my estimation, I have worked for UPS for 17 years and its become money driven."
good,A typical day at work consisted of  being told where you were working. After you were told where to go you began loading/unloading Semi-trailers. The walls of boxes would either shift due to driving conditions or would fall due to improper loading/restraint. During the winter overtime became a mandatory thing because it is the busy season. The co-workers come and go because it is one of the highest turnover jobs.
good,Hard day's work.  Not a lot of information provided about future.  Daily interaction with supervisors and daily changes as to routes and delivery areas.  Not an easy job!  They frequently made a hot lunch/dinner for the really cold days after punching out.  Like soup or sloppy joe sandwiches.  A nice jesture.
good,"I was in charge of selling UPS Supply Chain products and giving consultancy for Ocean freight, Airfreight, Logistics and Transportation to customers."
good,"My main responsibilities at UPS were maintaining bank accounts, board resolutions,maintenance and administration of the Bank Account Administration module on the Treasury intranet website and auditing of local signatories, forecasting and auditing of the European subsidiaries. Each analyst was assigned a group of countries and I found it extremely challenging to work with entities based in Russia as the local legislation makes opening, closing and maintaining board resolutions extremely difficult. I enjoyed being a part of the intranet website development and implementation. I also enjoyed being a guest auditor, travelling with the audit team to visit entities within Europe to help revise and better current treasury procedures."
good,I arrive at 5 am. Line up all my drivers with there helpers. I have my management briefing with district manager and on road supervisors to discuss daily plan. coordinate with my drivers on pick up points and times. Then relay information to my helpers 65 personnel in all plus 65 drivers. Confirm pick ups and replace helpers as needed.
good,"From the perspective of a Supervisor, UPS is a decent company to work for if you happen to be a hard worker. The work is routine, day-in and day-out, interspersed with periods of intense activity and long hours. It is an optimal place for a student to work, as they typically will work around your schedule, to a degree, and even pay a portion of your tuition."
good,"In a typical day/night at ups, it was very hard to work. But the coworkers and benefits make it bearable. I would've liked to get more than part time hours here. I think I would've stayed longer as an employee. Maybe even for life. But for the hard work, the money was only cutting even every week and I wasn't seeing as much progress I would've liked."
good,its all a roll of the dice they have good and bad jobs and managment
good,"Management was okay, could have been more realistic & tried putting them in the workers shoes. Understanding what it was like for us, not being so cocky on what part of management they were in. "
good,"This is a fun, fast pace job. I really enjoyed my time working for UPS."
good,"A very good company to work for if your primary motivations are stability, work/life balance, and commitment to the community.  Although the work/life balance varies greatly on your department, location, and boss.  A unique culture that favors those who begin their career in UPS operations and are committed to the company for the long haul.  It is not the place for someone looking for a large base salary or rapid career advancement. A ""fast"" career track at UPS is a promotion every 5-10 years."
good,I loaded or unloaded packages in semi trailers. learned alot about production n how to properly load a trailer.management was pretty gud helped u out alot and co workers were fun to work with.
good,"A position based on accommodating customers' shipping inquiries and expediting the process.  In addition, I conducted research of the location's area in order to expand the customer base."
good,UPS gets old very quickly.  I like to call it a job for people who do not want to do much with their lives.  I feel that if you are in college it would be great because of the pay and benefits.  The management is not the best.  UPS has a problem with promoting people they want in certain positions. Even though the business is thriving it could use some work internally.
good,"You work to have a certain number completed each day"
good,"very busy from the time i clocked in until clock out time. I worked as a team, independent, and had to make some decisions on my own.The tuffest part of this job was, clocking in at 4am. After that, my morning went by pretty fast."
good,"Really active and very simple , and really fun,  i learn how to be more successful"
good,"Was a delivery driver assistant for the holidays.  It was great experience, and a job suited for the high school graduate or part time student."
good,Learned how to be an effective supervisor. Also learned how to work as a team player. This job made me a hard working and responsible employee.
good,"Load unload trailers consisting of many different piece counts."
good,"It's a great place to work if you are looking to be groomed for top-notch management experience. They teach employees to be accountable not only to their superiors, but to themselves. It's a very structured, and safe environment, as safety is the number one goal in front of production. However, the opportunity for advancement is too far and in between. Which may not be a bad thing, because the promotion process is very rigorous; therefore, assuring that a individual is mentally and physically capable of carrying on more leadership responsibility."
good,I enjoyed working here. I like customer contact. and I learned alot. Its a College town so the people are fun.
good,"Established great communication among my co-workers and supervisors, made sure the packages were delivered to their destines and were damage free."
good,"Sales Shipping and Receiving,  Accounting, Inventory, computer filing,"
good,"great to work for just the union is a headache, very fast paced, hard labor job, good career money wise"
good,"I enjoy my job for it is challenging and very few dull moments. There are moments where my co-workers and I can joke about what is going on, but then's it's right back to business. I hold a very important position because if I am not in control of my environment then customers will not receive their packages or product on time. The hours that I work make if very difficult for me to have quality time with my family and it has had a negative impact on my health and wellness. I work very long hours, but that has never been an issue for me. The hardest part of my job is the hours that I am scheduled to work."
good,Fun with your friends and almost everyone rides. Plus you get to talk shop to your customers all day.
good,"I would load UPS truck and prepare for delivers, I have learned to work in a timely and accurate manner,  The management was high pressure at times,  The hardest part of the job was early morning hours"
good,"On a typical day at UPS as an operations supervisor we were required to fill out the proper bill of ladings for the drivers to transport all packages to the specified hub/ terminal locations.  We were required to inspire and drive all of our employees to make production according to UPS company standards, while working safely within OSHA regulations. The hardest part of the job was making sure all loads left at 100% while utilizing all available free space. The most enjoyable part of the job was motivating my employees to achieve their full potential while maintaining an orderly and timely work area."
good,I greet my co-workers. I learned how to work with and  look out  for other people. Lifting heavy packages. Management was helpful and fun. Having the feeling of doing a good job everyday.
good,"Handling packages all day from morning until the truck was empty. I learned a whole lot about taking safety precautions especially since this job can be hard on your body. I think management did their job well, they take this job and their workers very seriously. My coworkers were very nice and helpful. if I needed help with anything they were always there for me. The hardest part of the job would be delivering heavy packages to customers that didn't have an elevator available in the building. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being accompanied by a friendly worker throughout the day when this job can be very tiring."
good,I loved my job at UPS. UPS provided me with many good lessons about managing people and working effectively.  Communication was key to management and my direct leaders taught me a lot about communciation to my reports but also to the corporate team.
good,The equipment they provide makes the work-flow proceed very efficiently.   The best part of this job was the excellent job security and outstanding benefits.
good,"On a regular day, one badges in at the guard shack and rides a transport vehicle for about 10-15 minutes until they get to their work area. Once at the work area, one must badge in again to start pay, and everyone meets in a designated area to receive the details of the day, which include (but are not limited to): the final flight arriving for the day, safety tips, weather advisories, etc. You are then prompted to go to your work area and start working when your supervisor gives you the ""green-light"". You usually work for about 3-4 hours until it's time to go home receiving 10 minute breaks sometime during those hours. When the day is over, there is about a 10-15 minute ride back to the guard shack, or one as the option to walk if so chosen."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of safely loading freight according to size of load and content. Checking shipping papers to determine the nature of load and content description. loading freight to assure safety and minimize risk of damage and dangerous conditions. Management was very helpful and assisted if necessary. I would say the people that I worked with were very passionate in the work they did. I find that the hardest part of that job is the physical demand, I enjoyed every part of the job, it was my favorite job I've had."
good,"If you like working out while you get paid, and working outside no matter what this is a great job.  Unfortunately it takes a very long time to get to a full time position unless you get in at the right time.  The wait can be 10+ years sometimes.  Be prepared to need  a second source of income if you plan on sticking around,  great for someone just looking for benefits though as they are top notch!"
good,received alot of supervisory experience there.  But most jobs are part time
good,"Part time job helping customers shipping and picking up pkgs.  Loading trucks, tracking packages and resolving shipping issues."
good,The UPS store is a good place to start off with before moving on to higher positions within the company.
good,"Enregistrer les feuilles de route de la veille,des chauffeurs pour établir leur paie de fin de mois. Récupérer les fax UPS BORDEAUX centre de trie, interface entre les chauffeurs et le centre, préparation des poches d'encaissements des livraisons effectuées du jour, pour envoie avec la navette de 17h, appels des chauffeurs pour confirmation et codage interne des missions exécutées. Préparation de la navette, comptage des dïads des chauffeurs, contrôle des encaissements. "
good,"It is hard physical work, and a very typical 'warehouse' environment but most employees and management were very friendly and offered help to anyone needing it. "
good,"Uma boa empresa com um bom local de trabalho bastante hamônico,onde gerentes e diretores respeitam todos os funcionários."
good,"great company to work for, before i left they were more about getting the boxes out and less customer's first."
good,I run an outbound belt. Make sure employees are following proper load methods and get containers to aircraft on time.
good,"Always have to be ready to begin the days work as soon as you get there; keep grinding on until the end of the work period; co-workers are always something else, very diversified environment. The hardest part of a typical work day is getting towards the end of the work period one has be ready to go above and beyond."
good,Hard work warehouse job. Management was not the greatest. No room for advancement.
good,"nice place to work for management was very knowledgeable, hard work pays off only complaint is not enough hours most positions at my warehouse was part time"
good,it was a learning process but overall experience was good and fun
good,"Hard work but workable... Every day i learned new things to make me better at my job.. management was good but only a few...my co workers were wonderful to work with and very respectful at all times and very helpful. the hardest part of the job is finishing up the job with multiple task at the same time as far as doing more than one truck with a small time period...The enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done, make me feel accomplished and working with my nice co workers."
good,"direct and plan work load, instruct and train new employee's, release loads to drivers, track employee hours, good responsible employee's, difficult dealing with union issues"
good,busy environment & goals was to always put customer needs first and always prompt with services
good,"If you like being by yourself and self motivated very good job, very physical. has its good days and bad but very good job."

good,"All around a positive place to work.Most of it is geared towards shipping UPS,USPS and some Fed-Ex packages using multiple Computer Software...And meeting all Customer needs."
good,Very hard work. Learned zip codes and package routes.
good,Enjoy the ability to work with the driver on the routes I was assigned - the time past quickly taking care of the packages we were responsible for. It was easy to determine that your job was successful as you had constant interaction with the customers. The hardest part of this job was when the weather was cold. I learned to plan around tight deadlines and high expectations.
good,UPS was a great company to work for. Great pay and Union benifits.
good,i learn new things working in a warehouse also learned leadership also got along with my co-workers and my hardest part on my job was moving the huge boxes also i enjoyed the labor work.
good,Job is not very difficult once you can grasp the general idea. Mandatory overtime is the hardest part about the job.
good,The days are long and very fast-paced. All co-workers are fun to work with.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company learned a lot about my job fast , could have helped me find a new job with the company when I had to leave but got none .."
good,A typical day would include starting at all the companies for large amounts of deliveries. then after business's were delivered we would deliver to the residential areas on our route. Every once in a while we would stop and reorganize the packages depending on the area. I had a great driver I worked with and we worked well together. The hardest part of the job was probably the physical demand of lifting heavy packages throughout the day. The best part of the job was learning about the delivery process and learning the town better.
good,"As a loader you find out what 'fast paced"" work really means. Very physically demanding and tough."
good,"Working at UPS was a great experience. It required strength, energey, and ability but I enjoy hard work so it was nothing i could not handle. At this Job I unloaded packages from delivery trucks to be sorted to its proper destination in a timely fashion, working with management to meet precall requirements. I worked alone for the most part, but when help was needed my managers were efficient in that department. I lifted packages 75lbs and more, which are called irregs and followed all safety guidelines in the proccess. My job was steady from day to day, nothing changed so nothing was the hardest part. I knew what to expect, and performed every task to the best of my ability daily. I worked a 5 hour a day shift and the pay wasnt that great @ $8.50 an hour but overall I enjoyed the whole work experience."
good,"hard working people,fast pace,lifting boxes as much as 90 POUNDS a day"
good,"A typical day would involve a pre-communications meeting, work assignments if any are needed, and move to your dept. to work through your daily task."
good,"A typical day a work consisted of arriving at work early,gathering the proper equipment,and loading the correct packages into the correct trailer. I learned how to quickly scan and load packages into the correct trailer and what it took to become succesful in my job area. Management definately played a major part in helping its employees suceed in day to day tasks.My co-workers at ups were great they were always willing to help a hand to ensure all work loads were properly taken care of. The hardest part of the job was working in sometimes 100 degree weather inside of a truck loading thousands of packages in only a few hours and many times valued more senior employees were over looked for advancement inside of the company.During my time there i grew to enjoy the exercise i recieved from doing my daily tasks which helped keep my fit for other projects outside of ups."
good,"A typical day consists of just delivering packages, it is a bit monotonous but not bad. Bad part about the job is you have to sit in passenger seat where many fumes from the truck reside"
good,"scaning packages, loading and unloading trailers and package cars, teamwork and working with others, physically demanding job but keeps you in shape"
good,"Working for UPS wasn't bad, the work as a loader was just pysical, so it keeps you in shape, but the management leaves much to desire. Couple of the managers I encounter didn't have much people skills, all they done was yell and scream."
good,"I worked at UPS for 8 1/2 years, 5 1/2+ of which were in the operations management sector. My typical day, and it was a part-time job, involved collecting data for the upcoming day, such as performance metrics, scanning equipment, trailer identification, sealing tags and it's associated record sheet. Other days involved similar duties but for aircraft shipping containers. I was also responsible for scanning equipment, their set-up, maintenance and data processing. After performing these duties, I organized my personnel (anywhere from 1-12 persons depending on the area), briefed them on previous day results, todays expectations and most importantly our daily safety briefings. Every day was a learning experience for personnel, data and equipment management. Our day, performance and length of duty for the day was entirely dependent on incoming shipping volume. Getting experience with multiple personnel, different sections, and job descriptions allowed a great increase in practical knowledge, not only for the company, but my development as well. Management at UPS varied, depending on location. From my experience, at the larger facilities, tended to function better and have a greater sense of camaraderie, rather than at the smaller facilities which tended to be more ""every man for himself"". One thing can be said about the adjacent and upper management is that they do really care a great deal, among an intensity for success for their position. Many of whom which had advanced further up within the company. Coworkers at the company also varied, however, an unfortunate majority, in my"
good,UPs is a fast paced work environment. There will be a lot of confusion with supervisors when peak season hits. I like the job because i get to use machinary to assist with loading packages onto planes. Working at the airport is much better than working at the hub because you get more freedom and you are working outdoors. Meet the right people and they will have your back. There are cliques but most people are cool to talk to. I love being outdoors and working around planes.
good,I've never worked anywhere as hard as UPS. But if you stick it out the rewards are great.
good,Very well organized company. The best I have worked for. Satsifying the customer and providing the best service for the customer was the standard.
good,Typical day was filled with motivating assigned employees and performing quality assurance inspections. I really learned how to manage a diverse group to perform a homogenous task with a positive outcome each evening. The hardest part of the job was the work environment - no heat in the hub in the winter and no air conditioner in the summer.
good,"Great people, management could be hard but generally nice guys."
good,You have to go through metal detectors to get in and take a bus to your building and i would load about 5 ULDs every night which is about 1500 boxes and then would o back out the same way.
good,I learned alot working for this company. Things I didn't know about Workmans Comp. I became the top agent on my team getting the highest audit score. Making sure all claims were accurate and correct
good,"My typical day of work would consist of having a safety pre communication meeting with my employees. I helped and managed employees unloading packages on to the conveyor belt, and other employees to load the packages into the trailers. I had and excellent management team to start with. Hardest part of my job was dealing with a few co-workers who did not like their job as much. I enjoyed being there working and dealing with the customers and trying to satisfy them to the best of my ability."
good,Work day would consist of a lot of manual work in all types of weather. How to manage a large number of people in a chaotic environment for a period of 4-5 hrs. Co-workers were extremely vital in the production aspect of the job. Management were helpful for the most part. Hardest part of the job would be the manual work and constant pressure to get the job completed within the allotted hours. Most enjoyable part are those you work with and the benefits.
good,i learned how to pace myself the hardest part of the job is working in the extreme heat and i enjoyed getting overtime
good,Only part time no Full time available for after ten years. Income was poor.
good,The job entitled hardwork and the will to want to please the customers no matter what they wanted...
good,"c'etait un plaisir de travailler chaque jours a UPs, j'ai appris énormments des choses, jai servi les clients tout en apprennant"
good,"A typical day at UPS involved moving thousands of packages through a distribution center. Some of the most valuable information I learned was how to function as management in a union-driven environment. I was impressed with most upper management, but was in the very strict promote from within policy. I felt that we could have had much more talent on board if we went outside as needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the transportation piece. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but constant pressure from management and long, arduous hours take a toll on family life."
good,The largest logistics company. Can be a great place to start and finish with potential huge long term benefits.
good,I liked ups alot because i like to stay active and to me it was my daily work out.
good,"Fast paced, exciting workplace"
good,"Great company, co-workers and management were team players. Patience is a crucial part to this company."
good,scanning and loading packages intosemi-trucks that goes to deliver at different locations in the country.
good,Typically a 50 hour plus workweek. Great pay and benefits. Drive and deliver planned routes through the day with deadlines. Able to organize your day to some degree and good planning will make for a smooth day. Safety is extremely important and stressed daily. Must be a very capable and aware as a driver while you operate large vehicles. Management in your particular building will have the most influence on how much you enjoy your job. Enjoyed being outside working and getting excercise
good,ups is a fast pace environment based on production and includes heavy lifting. I have learned how to deal with employees adress issues as a management person and think quick making quick decisions while multi tasking. Management is often strict and vulgure. Co-workers vary as compitent and incompitent. The hardest part of the job is making production on a daily basis in short sort span. The most enjoyable part is having a job well done.
good,Overall good company to work for. Excellent health benefits.
good,"My day consist of managing several terminals across the United States. Decisions must be made to save the company money by moving freight as efficiently as possible. The department works as a team. We are each others resources. The hardest part of this job is making the decision that will satisify everyone, including the drivers who are not always happy with the instructions that they are given. The most enjoyable part of this job is the reward of knowing how much money the company was saved by my the personal decision."
good,The benefits are excellent. The working conditions are not the best. No full time jobs available unless you are management.
good,"Working in UPS has opened many doors for me because I've gained the skills needed to work in customer service. Other than learning how to balance the cash registers, how to utilize the computers and printers, and processing packages, I learned how to successfully run a business. I opened the store every morning at 8:30am and worked until 5pm most of the time. My coworkers were good teammates because we worked side by side to get every task done. The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect because I had to left heavy boxes everyday and sometimes it gave me back problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting my hands dirty. I loved packing because I was able to be productive with my hands. I never stood around, there was always something to do and I loved it because I surprised people with how well I can pack a television or anything fragile. I eventually became a professional and trained new coworkers how to perform at the same level. I loved working at UPS and been there for about 1 year and a half."
good,A typical day at work making sure packages were shipped out bfore 9:00 am I learned that packages are important because it consits of peoples personal items.My coworkers were exxcellent and were great team members.The most enjoyable part of this job was making sure every package was taken care of.
good,"It's a great company. Like all places, they try to load you with more work than they should get and give you the same pay. It is hard to advance in this environment. Overall, it was a great experience. Teaches you a lot!"
good,The company provides excellent benefits but shows no concern for their employees.
good,Love to work with this company enjoy the culture.But not to much work at the time only called four days.
good,"A typical day consists of a fast paced operation. I've learned that working in operations requires great emphasis on communication between both labor and management employees. The hardest part of the job would be working the preload shift which starts at 2:45am. The most enjoyable part of the job is success brought about by precision planning and the execution of it which produces great customer satisfaction, strenghtens employee relations, and boosts camaraderie in the workplace."
good,"excellent place to work and its conducive, friendly and tolerating"
good,Great job overall though at times very stressful and pain enduring
good,"For me the bennefits did not outweigh the risks of injury. Needed to move boxes very quickly and the boxes were very heavy. I had intense back pain the entire time i worked there. not a bad company, but the pay is horrible for the amount of work, and possible injury to my back. it was just not worth the pay. supervisors were not understanding, and would get mad very quickly. for 4 hours of work you would get a 10 minute break. which would have been fine, had i not had to move about 200 boxes at about 40lbs each in two hours straight. i think if i would have had more time to ease into the process, rather than right of the bat moving heavy boxes at a fast pace, i would have done much better in this company."
good,"I learned great management skills due to having to supervise up to 100 employees, management and hourly."
good,UPS was a pretty good company to work for. the only problem i had was how little room for advancement there was.
good,"warehouse environment,usually quiet until drivers finish their routes,controlled environment"
good,I had a great time working at UPS. My only issue was it cost and took more time to travel than profit I was making for working.
good,like the job...data entry but i love the hotel industry...
good,Overall a good company to work for giving the right management personnel.
good,I enjoyed working here. We did had our share of customers. I hate the hours when they got cut.
good,"Great company to work for, poor management. They don't let supervisors mature enough to learn the company."
good,"While the management life takes a toll on your physical and mental strength, there is a great deal of learning that transpires. You can learn and grow with the company and there is the ability to become well rounded. This is not a 9-5 job nor a place for someone that cannot take formative feedback."
good,I liked the busy work of UPS. We all worked hard and at a fast pace. I would still be there if I hadn't moved to Duluth. There was more room for advancement there but the heavy lifting would have taken a toll on my body but I miss being as fit as I was because of it.
good,"I love the fact I made the customers happy. I once judged UPS for my package being late or mistakenly delivered to my neighbor. Now I know from experience what they actually go through 250 packages a day sometimes even more up and down on and off the truck is a lot of work, all day long. I enjoyed my job while it lasted..Also may I add I had the best Driver ever who taught me the ropes to get by..thanks UPS."
good,If you do a good job and finished ahead of schedule you are routinely asked to help other drivers who do a bad job an run behind schedule. It seems to always be the same drivers and they are never dealt with.
good,Lots of young people and working in a small office environment. There is also opportunities to branch out into different aspects of packaging and other departments within UPS.
good,"It’s a good place to start but definitely not something that would be considered a permanent job, unless you can find avenues to grow and advance to more important jobs"
good,I love my job even though it is very physically demanding. I work with a great bunch of people I just wish the pay was better. The benefits are awesome and you get them even if you are part time after 1 year.
good,"Good overall work environment. Job work/life balance is decent, however in most cases there is a lack of communication in management and theres not much room for career growth"
good,"Enjoyed working at Ups delivering packages, everyone was nice and respectful. Managers helped with any problem that came up. Hope i work next season ."
good,"Started ups job as my very first job in the maryland, USA. Was challenging as a result of the weather and some of the companies policies on seasonal drivers helpers."
good,Great place . Straight forward working guidelines and great people to be working around . Organized work areas and good management. Fair treatment and room to grow.
good,"I worked as a seasonal driver helper. Made some decent cash over the holiday season, wasn't really hard work just cold and occasionally slippery. the uniform was nice cause it was warm but turning it in later on was kinda a hastle"
good,"Physical job, but overall fun and friendly environment. "
good,But the hours are inconsistent and the equipment is outdated.   beacuse of the nature of the wokr the start time changes every day and the end time remains the same and that takes some time to get used to
good,I really enjoyed working as a driver helper. I love being outdoors and doing physical labor and this job includes both. This job is definitely not for the faint at heart...its very physical amd exhausting.
good,I loved working at ups the constant exercise was really good . the hardest part about was dealing with cold weather if you are not used to it you can get sick . met sone fun interesting people ups does not discriminate the people they hire
good,"Would definitely recommend this place to anyone good knowledge of areas an advantage but you can do the job blind every day is different , had a great experience this Christmas found after 2/3 days was already ahead of the driver"
good,cansado porque todo el dia se tenia estar en la calle
good,I love everything my job entails. I just wish the manager would see how great I work. But people who are still employed after 20 years they are not working as much but get all the credit. They are slackers. Letting the new people do the work.
good,UPS has good health benefits with a lot of growth in the company for hard working individuals. I really don’t know what else positive to say about UPS
good,"The world of shipping is a fast paced and sometimes unfair world. The hardest part of this job is dealing with upset customers, because most of the time they are upset about something that you have no control over and can't help with. So then they get angry and go write a review about how you refused to help them when that wasn't actually what happened and then the business suffers. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with everyday. They are so full of energy and make work fun even on days where you feel like you just can't deal."
good,"Great working here so far. "
good,"part time work - full time benefits ... how can you beat that ?!"
good,"Great people, good benefits, flexible hours depending on position. Management can be inconsistent in views and prioritizing objectives. Not always feel like you're an important member of the team."
good,"UPS was a challenging but enjoyable environment to work in. UPS creates a good work-life balance for part-time employees. The benefits are great, and the people are fun to work with and be around."
good,"Fast paced environment especially around Christmas season"
good,"They provide reasonable health benefits to anyone applies their, they also have a college program that's available anyone to who's looking to going to college."
good,"Good company overall, but sometimes they valued their bottom line too much over the needs of the customer and their employees. It’s a good place to work for college students, as in parts of the country they offer tuition assistance."
good,"They seem to have a very personable staff in the warehouses. I worked on the truck where me and my driver formed a very good relationship. I was a women in the workforce (which was rare) so the lax temperament also could be a downside. It was important to make boundaries clear and the HR would protect you from there. But once the boundary was set very few crossed it, they are very kind happy people"
good,"Daily work in the place is fast paced. There’s really no down time unless you work in a slow area. I load trucks daily and the locations I do are cool. But if it a day of really heavy flow , be ready to work."
good,"Die Arbeit bei Ups hat Spaß gemacht, wenn es auch sehr stressig war. Die Mitarbeiter waren bis auf 1-2 Menschen sehr nett und hilfsbereit und die Bezahlung ist mehr als fair."
good,"help driver organize packages on truck, aid in delivering packages to intended recipient.   Can be demanding , in regard to hours and climate due to being outside."
good,"I worked at UPS for about 8 months. They start you out loading trucks, but if you show promise, they move you up to the primary, where you unload the tractor trailers as they come in. The job is physically demanding, but the time goes by pretty fast, and you can listen to music during your shift."
good,"Good place to work,if you like to work part time, opportunity to advance after you get enough experience.  If you are results driven and goal oriented then UOS is for you."
good,"Started out as a seasonal loader on preload, was rehired after peak and was quickly promoted to part-time supervisor, which is the position I'm mostly going to be referencing. "
good,"I absolutely loved working with UPS as a (Christmas Seasonal) Package Handler! It is a fast paced job, from 4:30am to 10am, or all day if you choose to be a Driver Helper too. Coworkers make the job fun on the days you'd rather sleep in, and the pay wasn't bad either for part-time and unfortunately temporary work. Though people have good work ethic, and are wanted to be held onto by management, the Seniority System rules, the last person to be hired is the first to go. Period. So if you are applying for Christmas Seasonal Help, and hope to stay, apply as early as possible to hold your spot! Disclaimer: this is not a position for everyone. It's very fast paced and requires your full attention and focus at an early hour."
good,Good place to work whether your are looking for a seasonal job or something more permanent.  Fast-paced so you are not sitting around wasting time.  Work can be good exercise and is paid well.
good,it was hard work but it was fun. i was a driver helper so it was part time. Depending where you deliver you meet a lot of people. great exercise with all the walking you do.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UPS and would have liked to remain there because the hours worked very well with my college schedule. The job was straightforward and fast paced, helped the time pass quickly. Only complaint is that I was told I would be kept as a full time employee and was never called back into work, otherwise it’s a great workplace."
good,"Nice people I worked with, but there was not very good communication with the office people. For example, I tried to get a hold of something via text, phone call and email, and never received a response about an inquiry I had about starting this job. There should be better communication between people in the office and the drivers/helpers out on the road. But overall, I had a good experience."
good,A typical day is fast paced repetitive by making production by being on time and prepared to work. Meeting company goals in a safe manner. I learned tremendously from management and higher ups in the company. The culture is diverse the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet and learn from multiple experienced individuals. Not a hard job it's preparing yourself mentally to execute tasks.
good,"Great company to work for . They offer great benefits. My main focus was to get the job done the nest way and that’s what I focused on. I had huge issue with Kind of foul language the employees used, cussed a lot"
good,This is a great company to work for and the training is awesome. I hope to retire from a company like this. I enjoyed the work the freedom and respect that customers give you for your professionaprofessionalism se
good,"Warehouse can be fast paced at times but nothing to hard"
good,This job is a unionized employment. Great benefits and good pay. The typical day is 3 to 5 hours of either unloading airplane containers or feeder trucks.
good,Able to engage with both customers and other employees to help make the process of shipping more optimal and get thing where they need to be at the correct time in one piece. Environment was very positive and felt tight nit creates a sense of in it together mentality.
good,"Strong work culture.  UPS expects a lot from its employees, but UPS provides opportunities for advancement.  Most manager work with their employees to achieve a good work/life balance."
good,"Seasonal drivers helper position was a fantastic opportunity to work. It afforded my family the luxury of having the ""Extras"" during the holiday season. I would like to be a permanent employee @ UPS."
good,"It’s a lot of good and bad things I can say but over all I love working there, it’s almost like you getting paid to workout. The best part is, you have room to grow in the company."
good,"Working at ups was not to bad, some days longer then others. Some days were hard and some were easy, you get pretty good hours for the ammount of work that has to be done"
good,HR process leaves alot to be desired. Not a fair process and when I reported issues with evidence it was swept under the rug. I absolutely loved my job as was extremely good at it
good,"Only worked there for the seasonal Job Helper, but I found the job to be very well. I got payed well, the drivers were respectful and understanding, you have to be a quick thinker and be fast on your feet, simple work."
good,"Short seasonal work, but very fast-paced and rough exhausting. The time of employment for me was around Black Friday and Christmas Peak Season, so the volume of work in all fields increased by an extraordinary amount. It can be hard due to she sheer volume of work given to you at a time, but it's never impossible. The hours were long, going upwards to 11 to 12 hours of work, and at the end of the day, you will feel tired. However, the management is helpful as well as the employees."
good,"Supervisor discretion is how a lot of the business works.  Day to day is quite enjoyable.  The work life balance is nice,  with overtime offered periodically from increased demand.  Downside is that the only two guaranteed holidays off in a year are Thanksgiving day and Christmas with holiday pay for most of the others.  "
good,"I worked there seasonally & we received pay weekly. It was great. If you stay on schedule, you’ll pick up hours & be rewarded. Just set down the package and ring the doorbell."
good,"UPS is the world's largest package delivery company and  leading global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services. It feels good to work with a Respected company that also treats there employees as an asset. Great benefits and work ethic. The income is decent and there is room for advancement. The only negative is working as a Driver Helper during the seasonal temp to perm, They offered a lot of overtime and the job ending in mid Jan. They did not make us aware that we would be on call everyday. Averaged 3-4 hrs a day driving golf cart delivery until the last 2 weeks before Xmas and job was over 2 days after Xmas. Leaving me financially in a serious bind. Permanent hire doesn't start until February."
good,It was a good place to work for very fast pace and lots of lifting from heavy to light but everyone works together to get trucks unloaded and loaded  good pay and great benefits
good,Very fast pace atmosphere great people and management long hours I learned great new things how to work different machines and learned how to operate new machines
good,"Lots of on the job learning. depending on the shift, the workload will vary. Management is always doing a good job. The hardest part of the job can be the workload."
good,I am needing full time employment.  Have been employed at UPS since October and have yet to work a 40 hour week.  I have a family and I need full time employment.
good,"My experience at ups wasn't that far from working in ur average warehouse.   Just with more organization and rhythm."
good,"Overall I worked at UPS for about 4 months before I had to quit because of school getting stressful, in my opinion. I recommend ups to those who can collaborate with others and are able to work in a fast paced environment. If you don't meet these standards then I suggest you look somewhere else."
good,"As a Driver Helper (Seasonal), you mostly take everything to the customers door. The drivers are all very professional.  It is not easy work, but I do enjoy working at UPS."
good,"At UPS my experience wasnt bad, i did feel as though some of the supervisors did not care ver much about their team. It is a physical job, so you are having to stand and do a lot of motion in this high volume enviorment. Making friends while there does keep your mind off of all of the hard work that your body is enduring everyday and makes the time go by fairly fast. "
good,If you get the right driver and route its cool otherwise it can be a bummer uniform is kinda non visible people front recognize the vest till after the strange looks and questions but ok
good,The employees at this company are great and most have an extremely amazing work ethic with the will and power to succeed. Managers are always motivating you to do your absolute best and you absolutely always feel appreciated for your hard work here. It's a physically and mentally exhausting job at times but so rewarding in so many different aspects.
good,"Overall, UPS offers numerous benefits such as medical and dental insurance. One major perk for new hires is a weekly attendance bonus! All workers start out as package handlers, which is a VERY physical job! Make sure you are in good physical condition because you are constantly lifting packages of varying weight."
good,The company is ok an works hard to be the best in there industry so right now I enjoy being employed by them. Hrs are good for me right now work is hard but I can hang with it.
good,Learning to work well with others and maintain high standards within the industry.  This is a fast pace work environment that pays well with benefits and salary.  It does make it difficult to enjoy a good work/life balance.
good,"Same schedule/ process day in, day out."
good,"A typical day is constant customers, printing material, finishing printed material (cutting, trimming, binding), moving boxes, packaging, working with machinery (troubleshooting) and being on your on your feet all day."
good,"I've learn a lot working with this job. More on safety hazards, as well hazmat materials. It teaches you to how to keep consumers happy and satisfied. Also teaches you how to handle packages the right way and stack materials/boxes. It is a very good job to make a career out of with great benefits to come along with it."
good,It's a great place to work for a part time/seasonal job just in time for Christmas. That and the pay is great for the amount of hours you get along with added other part time jobs like driver helper to get more hours in or better job security.
good,"One of the largest and fastest growing shipping company, founded in 1906.  Employees work very hard on all levels from the package handlers to the drivers.  Management side of life is rough in this company.  Long hours and extreme pressure."
good,Great place to work if you're looking to build a career. Very fast pace and physical work. In order to move up in management you will have to start from becoming a loader
good,Ups was a good job that benefits well just the hours could be better or extended the hardest part of the job was lifting the heavier boxes but overall it was a great experience
good,"Nice company to work for, Management can be better, bot over all..... Good. They work with your schedule. Most of the people that work there are very understanding."
good,"UPS is an excellent company to be a part of. Great benefits. Great advancements. Fast-paced but overall worth it. If you didn't have good customer relations before working for UPS, you will in a short period of your job. Overall, UPS is great!"
good,"It was a pretty okay job. Definitely go for a permanent job after the season. Oh, and layer up on clothing, because some days that truck will be an ice box."
good,Enjoyed the compensation I received did not enjoy the stress ok delivering in Charlottesville with a large trailer. Glad I stuck it out to get my pension.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when it is peak season.You will see each and everyone busy especially the leads.You will see everylead busy to get the job done on time and in safety manner.
good,My job is a very demanding job and requires excellent organizing and planning.  If you are an excellent organizer and planner the job will come much easier to you.   Although you are part of the IT department you will be working with the users/managers of the daily operations and will essentially be part of their team.  You will be the operation's go to person for all technology issues they have and also be responsible to maintaining  all the IT technologies they used in their daily operations.  You will also be a critical component in implementing new technologies as they are released to the operation and to assist users/managers in the transitioning to these new technologies which include training and support.The download side of this job is having to be flexible with your work schedule due to this is a 24 hour operation.  The most enjoyable side of this job is the people you work with or support because they become a second family for you.
good,"I sort packages for 81st St in Indianapolis. Plain and simple, it is difficult work. No matter where you are at you have some sort of physical position that you start in. As a sorter, you must be able to lift up to and including 70lbs repeatedly for up to 4 hours. You are provided one 10 minute break. All this to say, sometimes it is hard to see the good in what you are doing when you start out because you are only paid 14/hr. Most part time employees are only there for the benefits. "
good,"I like the company and the managers are great but they send half of us home as soon as we get there because they don't need us. So, we get up at 2am head to work, clock in and get sent home immediately. Of course seniority counts so they get the option but if you're new you just have to go.  I hope it changes soon."
good,"Pros"
good,"Extremely fast paced work environment with little down time.  Though the work is repetitive, no two days are the same, the need to adapt to change is extremely important."
good,"As long as you work as a team, whether it’s you & 1 other person or even 8 people, work flows great. It’s a quick paced environment yet extremely easy also."
good,If a person can make ít  at ups thêy can make ít anywhere. The work is hard.packages co me đown the conver bết like a good and you make gave the skills to mulltitask
good,Excellent for young career seeking people. UPS almost always hires and promotes from within.  Training is all done in house and none required to get hired.
good,Working at UPS isn't so bad. Besides waking up early in the morning it was a manageable job. Sometimes managers can get on your case if your stacking too many boxes my your trucks but other than that it was okay.
good,"Good job to have for full time employees. Starting off part-time as an employee is difficult. Compensation is not going through, it’s almost impossible to talk to someone about payroll."
good,I enjoyed my time there but advancement is slow and a person has to give a lot of years to the company to get a full time position with a great salary. I used the connections I made there to get a better job and felt that it was time to move on.
good,I was excited about work every day the staff was great and the work wasn't difficult it's great if you need a part time job to bring in a little extra cash around the holidays
good,"My biggest gripe with UPS was their archaic stance on appearance standards. I have no problem with the dress code as I think the business casual was fitting for the workplace... However the male grooming standards I felt were a bit unfair. The only thing being that men are required to keep their head hair and facial hair within military standard. Women are allowed to express themselves in many ways with make up, hairstyles, and more while the men have to all either be bald or have and short hair style and no beard."
good,"If you're in the engineering field you have more freedom in hours, control of your schedule, work/life balance, etc. If you're in operations or some job connected to operations you have little to no control over hours and work life balance."
good,"UPS is one of the largest multinational package delivery companies. We have a wide variety of jobs Package Handler, Driver Helper, Sorter, Delivery Driver, Warehouse, and Clerk. Good company with benefits to part time employees along with good pay ."
good,"UPS is a great company, but things are changing drastically from an operations standpoint. This change will be a culture shock to many employees that have been around for years."
good,"Management and Staff are supportive. Loved the working atmosphere, even if its a fast paced workplace, you dont get stressed out quickly. And the best thing is that you get Weekends off."
good,Some times it's heavy and some times it's light. But the good part is that you are on your own all day. You get a time and half for all your overtime hours.
good,Everyone was treated equally and fair and you got the opportunity to advance up if you want to. There isn't any AC but it never gets too hot. The people there are fairly nice and decent
good,The job wasn’t bad I enjoyed the workout and meeting tons of people and when peak came around double shifting was great made good money the management was just poor in my eyes
good,Ups was great starting out but by the end the union left me hanging and ruined as a hard worker because hard work gets u know where only seniority does
good,Working at Ups is a good opportunity to become very successful without any school back round . It is a career and you can take it as far as u want to go. There is a union great benefits
good,"The job was great and easy to master. Just un reasonable goals were set, with limited resource and tools to achieve them, along with limited work personnel."
good,"Operations Management is tough, support functions are better for work/life balance. Hourly workers and drivers have a lot of direct oversight with new technology (probably will increase more in the future to improve production)."
good,It was a wonderful job but my body couldn’t keep up with the massive work load of constant 50-70 pound packages. Management in some parts of my location were very week in some parts of the factory vs others. It seems like just anyone can get into management and it turns into one big mess when two managers butt heads
good,"The management would visit regularly to check up and would make sure to tell us we were doing well, and the supervisors were always available to ask questions or whatever you need."
good,It was a simple job and not much needs to be said besides it helped me become how I am as I grew up. It thought be people skills and simple box handling and packaging
good,"The work is easy and the pay is okay. No benefits. There is a lot of heavy lifting,and you are on your feet most of the day. You answer phones and process transactions. Computer skills are a big plus."
good,"Fast paced work environment, employees are in charge of unloading freight from trailers using conveyor belts, others are in charge of sorting packages."
good,My experience with UPS is unlike most other places. This company truly involves everyone into a working cycle to get the job done. Everybody is a working part in the system so there’s no place to be the guy/girl who can’t hold their own weight.
good,"Competitive pay and benefits if you are willing to put in the work. They require a lot of time, but the compensation is better than you will get elsewhere without a college degree"
good,I think management could use a little help  but it was a job where I gained skill and experience. Would I work there again? Yes why not ... I only left so to travel
good,"UPS is a top rated business with good benefits and is career oriented for those seeking long term employment.  UPS has many areas to work in (drivers, customer service, package handlers and seasonal)."
good,"I love working for UPS. Everyone is friendly and willing to help if you have questions. Fast paced hard working environment. Compensation is nice and there is a nice life-work balance. The only con I can think of, would be this position does not have steady hours you can plan on. I like working for this company so much, I take the hours I can get."
good,"Doing night shift has great advantages like a bonus for being on time every day of the week, but if you do go for night shifts, dont plan on going out during daylight."
good,"The workplace culture is one that is difficult to replace.UPS helps build character and gives you the ability to take pride in your work, the team morale is heavily encouraged."
good,"Loved everything about working for UPS; travel, pay, advancement oppurtunities, training opportunities and team members.  Definitely fast paced and stressful. Miss it dearly; enough though it often drove me crazy."
good,Tough job to get into and not steady work to start. But great pay and benefits. If u can hang in and work when they call u can usually get ur own route in 2-3 years
good,Working at ups up have to be aable to pick up at least 50lb or more it's a good job for a collage student or something like that. But if you have a family it not enough money for you.
good,"Only time for personal plans, family, holiday plans, on two days off since most days & evenings are worked during peak season with only time off on weekends."
good,"It was a great place to work, most everyone was friendly and helpful. I learned a lot and became proficient at my job. I learned how to work with diads, high values, early am's. I answered phone calls, emails, and customer messages. There was a lot of problem solving skills I had to master, there were a lot of interruptions in the day but you must stay calm and collected to push through and overcome those obstacles. There was a huge struggle understanding all of the union duties and when you feel you understand them there is always a way for the union workers to win the argument. They are allowed to slack off and get away with it and there is nothing you can do."
good,If you are looking for a part-time job with benefits this is the place to be. The working conditions can sometimes be hot and very fast paced but in exchange you get medical and dental benefits for the cost of union dues and sometimes you work less than two hours a day.
good,I only worked seasonal and the hours to continue I wasn’t able to work in my schedule!but if I got the opportunity to except that again I will... I do feel that if the workers trained the seasonal helpers better and more detailed the company could find some Jewels doing that time of the Year
good,"Shift applied for is 4am-9am but they change start times to 230,3,330,345. These hour changes can be difficult if you have a full time job. Job is fast paced but a good workout. I do not suggest this if you need a full 8hrs of sleep."
good,It was a fun job alot of friendly people there and if you plan on staying with the company they offer good benefits  you will learn alot about zip codes
good,"i worked there for a few years and loved it for the most part. benefits are excellent when you finally get them after a year of employment...which is ridiculous. they'll work ya like crazyl when they need you, but you'll get dropped a lot after peak season. "
good,"Working for UPS was at times a very fun job and at time a very stressful one I suppose as most are. Moving in and out of a variety of different spaces all day was something that I truly enjoyed about this position. The daily challenge of getting all express deliveries done on time was very fun. Mornings with UPS could be quite hectic with more work than seems possible to do but the staff is pretty good at working as a team and always seems to get it all done."
good,Fast paced learning environment with tons of room for advancement and growth. Helpful coworkers and inviting work place make for a good place to work.
good,Been working for ups for almost a yesr. It will be a year in November.  One minute we were getting a lot of hours. And know we are hardly getting any hours at all. A lot of people are getting less than 40 hpurs a week. And we all are full time.  Mangers get all the big money. While the workers themselves get hardly anything.  The workers get paid once a week.  While management gets paid once a month.  Really consider before applying at any ups.
good,You’re day would being by walking in clocking in and grabbing a scanner that hopefully work then go to your trailer/ trailers and load for a while with poorly maintained rollers
good,"Great part time job, early mornings allow for open day schedule. Great work out, fast paced environment. Benefits after 1 yr. And apart of the Teamsters union."
good,"UPS was fun to work at. No customer service requirements, no need to put on makeup, and great people to work with. The pay is good and bosses are understanding. You can voice your concerns but complaining won’t get you far. The fast pace we’d work at made the time fly. Only reason I left ups was because my summer hours effected my sleeping schedule which effected my work efficiency."
good,The job was okay just a bit physically demanding. The management could definitely be improved. Shifts were usually only a couple hours and you could be sent home early frequently too.
good,"Benefit package is awesome & we are union covered, job security! No where else like it. "
good,The hours here for workers in the hub are hard. Either 7-12 0r 2am to 8am. Managing regular family life and another job will be difficult. It's harder if you want to be a driver too.
good,"In this city, this employer is probably most people's best bet to receive funding for higher education. They also have good health benefits, though you gain them after a full year of employment. The job itself can be exceptionally hard on the body, and cannot be recommended long term unless you advance in the company."
good,This job is no joke. They demand discipline from the start or they’ll teach you it. They do not put up with tardiness and have strict rules you must follow. This is a very fast job and very physically grueling that can lead into a driver or management position. The reward if you can do it is 55k-120k and the best benefits  out there.  It’s not for everyone but God Bless all that can !
good,It was almost like getting paid to go to the gym each work day. That's something that i look at as a major pro throughout my time working at the UPS hub.
good,"Job can be a bit demanding, and the pay isn't very good. However the benefits are great, and there are all kinds of great opportunities there. they pay for your school"
good,"UPS is the first company that I received management experience with.  This experience has allowed me to further develop many skills: communication, problem solving, critical-thinking, integrity, etc."
good,"It is a production environment and there is constant demand for improvement. There is considerable pressure from upper management. The stress levels are high. More emphasis is placed on what is done incorrectly than what is done correctly. Success only comes with effective team management and getting buy-in from your team. How you do this depends on your management style. Though this job is extremely challenging, even small successes go a long way. Once you are, there is no greater feeling of accomplishment."
good,"UPS has amazing benefits and is one reason a ton of people choose to work there. However, as far as pay it's pretty decent. You do get yearly raises with sometimes change due to contract changes but typically it's $0.50/yr so...if you really want to stay there long you could rack it up but it'll be very draining."
good,Working at ups was very labor intensive. It helped get me in the best shape of my life. The pay was lacking but was made up for with benefits. They paid a large portion off my tuition.
good,The hardest part about working at a UPS store was typically on Mondays when the store would be so busy. There would be many uncooperative customers who weren’t willing to wait and would give us workers a hard time
good,"Fast paced environment, great team work, strict management, recommend it for people with a strong minset. Also it is an out-worked job. So when being at interview thonk about it twice."
good,"A typical workday starts around 3 am. My objective as a security supervisor is to ensure the physical security of the building. I use guard service to check employees and visitors in and out of the facility. I also am required to reduce claims by monitoring the deliveries of all packages. Any package lost or damaged at my facility is investigated daily. I use reports, security systems, and other tools, such as CCTV, to resolve claims quickly. I work with management from other support departments to make sure the total operation is successful. UPS culture is customer service driven and the packages are our customers. UPS goal is to provide the best service possible. “What can brown do for you.” The hardest part of the job is keeping all work areas on the same page. We are only as strong as our weakest team member. If an area falls behind, it can delay the whole operation. The best part of the job is knowing we provide a service that provide joy on a daily basis."
good,"The management is fair and demands are mostly reasonable. Certain factors in the industry, ie. coastal location vs central, bldg costs, local wages, it is getting difficult to acquire and retain larger accounts. This means overtime and advancement opportunities are limited at the moment. However, layoffs are avoided with all effort."
good,Overall ups is a good company to work for in the long run. They have pretty good union. They offer great benefits and they give raises every six months.
good,"A well set company compile of various divisions that service the global and national transportation of air, ground and ocean packages for their end customer base."
good,"UPS was a hard fast pace environment. Managers are motivating and safety oriented. "
good,As a driver helper wich is only during the holidays i help the driver deliver there packages quicker i had a great drivershe treated me with respect and worked good together
good,I love my co-workers we really feel like a family and it made working a lot more interesting and learning a lot better. I caught on quick and the job became rather easy and enjoyable.
good,A typical day at UPS would go about and respectful uplifting way. I learned the more you show people to respect you would want they would give it back in return. Personally through my experience I think management needs a little help. The workplace culture was very respectful. The hardest part of the job was when we would go to make a delivery and the person would not be available to take the package. The most enjoyable part of the job was making all of the customers smile and receiving tips.
good,"Very quick pace, culture friendly. You are taught how to use the machinery, how to organize, load & unload. Management was laid back but very on point. Rush hour was the only real difficulty of the job. The enjoyable part was the people i worked with."
good,"UPS is good, honest work, but if you are not used to the stress and physical labor of package handling, it can be daunting at first. It is a fast paced environment with odd hours, either early morning before 10:00, or later in the evening."
good,A typical day at work consist of sorting packages to correct station. I’ve learned to pace myself and how to keep focus. Managers assist you in your daily job and answer all questions.the hardest part of my job is lifting heavier packages that I’m not used to.
good,Your working in a hot warehouse unloading trucks/trailers trying to get the packages before drivers leave to deliver. The company also benefits with helping the community in the city.
good,The people that I worked with were very fast passes and serious but at the same time we enjoyed our job. There was always room for advancement in the company of you took the opportunity to do som they were flexible and caring people .
good,"Working at the UPS allowed me to learn various skills, such  as how to multitask and talk to customers. I also learned plenty about packiging and delivering packages across the country and internationaly. I also had the priviledge of learning about different countries' customs policies and intercontinental policies. It was an informative experience."
good,Depending on your roll at ups it’s a great job. I was first a package handler during peak season (Christmas time) and I loved it! It was very fast paced and it went by quick everyday. The hours were crazy. You go in anywhere from midnight and work until 8am. Sometimes later like 4am start time. After peak season I became a part time preload supervisor. The pay was way better in this position but you had to pay for your benefits. As a package handler you got all the same insurance but for free
good,"During my time with UPS I worked many different roles. I started out loading trucks during their peak season and did well enough that they brought me on permanently. I wanted to move up in the company so I applied for a ""management"" position. I was promoted to data supervisor which I thoroughly enjoyed. From there I started to help with the customers issues. The hardest part was to go full time since they promote from within it was hard to get full time positions."
good,"The job itself is pretty hard and heavy. It is not for everyone, it is for the strong minded and the determined. Great environment and people as well."
good,"Although UPS isn’t any easy job by any means, being outside and working independently is a positive. Over the years I have learned patience and being able to adjust to changing conditions and situations throughout a work day."
good,Pas beaucoup de possibilitéés d’évolution mais beaucoup d'emplois.
good,People are okay and i made a lot of new friends and the benifts are great but pay and the hours are terrible. Im in the process of finding a new job bc i dont make enough to pay for my bills
good,I have have only recently started but it is very fast paced although the benefits are good if you stick for the long run. You need to be a worker for 9 months to qualify for insurance but you do get tuition reimbursement as soon as you start I believe.
good,You pretty much get paid to work out here. Competitive and can be very fast pace. Physical and at times heavy. Peak season up to 12hr shifts. Ot (after 5hrs) and optional. Flexible hours. Various shifts
good,"Good for a college student but hard to balance college life with work. The nightshift along with little pay and hard, stressful work was not worth the stress."
good,I had a lot of fun during my employment and learned a lot of interesting skills. The people I worked with were team players and the customers were very friendly and reasonable.
good,"Consistent work and pay environment. Fast paced and time oriented job, but with great pay benefits. Management is mediocre, but the benefits and work/pay are great."
good,"a typical day at work would be starting work when its dark, learning how to make everything a 100% clean. The hardest part of the job has got to be the long hours and late night working outside in the winter. The most enjoyable part of working in UPS is getting to know the great people aroung you."
good,"while driving around delivering customer orders on time, running to deliver everything on time, heavy items/ boxes. no matter how big or small the delivery has to be made"
good,"Enjoyed working there. Great pay and benefits. Nice equipment. Good people at terminals. Fast paced work environment, helps days fly by. Very strong safety protocols in place."
good,"Pay and benefits are actually pretty good if you only want to work part-time.  The schedule varies, tends to favor second shift or overnight workers, but if you can take those hours it's generally decent work."
good,"Working in a warehouse, you have to understand, they will get their money out of you. If you're not a person that likes to sweat, loading and unloading is not for you."
good,My job at UPS was a temporary seasonal job. My supervisors made working very relaxed and didn't micro manage. He allowed me to work by myself and gave me a specific amount of deliveries to get done. The hardest part about this job was working in the cold. The part I enjoyed most about the job was how happy people were to receive their packages since it was right around Christmas.
good,typical day of work consist of the trucks being loaded and checked for misloads before the drivers go out for delivery. We also have the option to ride with the driver as driver helper during peak season.
good,really lucky if you can walk normal ofter 30 years of hard work in and out of truck 300 times a day and 600 packages. Ive had a number of surgeries to deal with
good,"At ups there is different positions in the warehouse from unload, outbound, and small sort. All the positions are fast pace and require a lot of lifting and lowering of packages."
good,"It is a great place to work while going to school. The work is extremely physical but worth it. Safety is important to the whole company, you become a team, and benefits are outstanding"
good,Worked there for only a year working on a consultant project. Many people had been working there for decades which is always a good quality in a company.
good,"Great experience as far learning how to manage people, this place is chock full of mentors, successful people that have a lot of knowledge and are willing to give to the right person."
good,Great place to go I'd you dont have a degree and want good pay and benefits. Constant cycle of new supervision. Can be challenging to work here if you have another full time job.
good,"It was ok working at ups,some of the drivers was helpful some took advantage but I went in and did my work regardless.some drivers made the helper do all the work and some drivers actually helped."
good,"En 14 ans j'ai appris beaucoup grace a eux, j'ai eu une bonne expérience téléphonique ce qui m'a permis de prendre confiance"
good,"They warn you before you take the job that it's difficult and hard on the body. They give good pay though, with benefits that rival many other big companies to top it off. Working there will be difficult at first but well worth the effort with what they give their employees. This is especially the case with how long you work for them."
good,"UPS is like a workout environment, lifting boxes from all shape an sides. Its also a competitive place because people will make unloading a truck a race to see who gets done first."
good,"Mein Altag war Pakete skannen, sortieren und im LKW einlagern. Habe gelernt einen Skanner zu bedienen, habe geübt schwere Pakete zu heben. Das Mangement, war gut nur leider ist für meine zweite Schicht keine U-Bahn mehr gefahren. Das Personal war sehr unterschiedlich. Das Gehalt war sehr hoch."
good,This job requires you to lift weight up to 50- pounds of more. Everything is fast paced. The work area you will be in will be either hot in the summer or cold in the winter so you have to dress accordingly.
good,Works schedule worked well with my school schedule. I was able to balance both due to the flexibility of both. Good company to work for a part time job.
good,"I like the overall pay/structure of the job."
good,I love the management set up at the ups store but my co workers are awful representatives of the company. they are really the only reason I have stayed thus far but I really think the environment in the work place could be bettered.
good,"UPS is a great place to work for the most part.  The people there are great.  Expectations are really high though, and working there can really be stressful.  If your a driver, you really have to mess up bad to lose you job there because of the Union.  Advancement is really tough if you do not have people selling you."
good,"Pay which accurately reflected my punch card was never a problem. You don't need to be in tip-top shape, but you shouldn't be very out-of -shape, because you will be carrying things and climbing in and out of the truck."
good,UPS was a fun place to work.  It was challenging and face paced.  Stayed busy and made time go by fast.  College benefits were helpful as well.  All in all great place to work!!
good,"High pressure, stress work environment, hard on the body. Takes many years to get full-time driver job or full-time supervisor position. Good pay and benefits."
good,"Good for workout and motive also work team, safely area, and so hard to do right things.  respect people, help each other, follow the rules,  and on time"
good,The job was good and paid well but if you aren’t ready for the heavy lifting and long hours then don’t apply. They treat you fairly and they want you to do your best everyday you come into work
good,I really enjoyed working at UPS but hated it at the same time. I worked 70-80 hours a week a lot of times. They take care of people but also strip them from having a life outside of work.
good,"Work with on road driver supervisors, drivers and hub staff to ensure the logistics of daily delivery routes were completed on time. Including, driver dispatch, tracking and customer service and account sales for all concerns in the Malvern center, as well as reports and daily statistics."
good,"The manager for the warehouse literally doesn't know the basic functions of the warehouse. But other than that, the work place wasn't bad, everyone there is pretty nice and easy to work with, keeps you in good shape too!"
good,Great place to work. Coworkers looked out for each other. Very fast pace. Long hours. Constantly moving. Never a dull moment. Overall it’s a team friendly atmosphere.
good,"It's a physically challenging job, but if able to stick it out, it is well worth the efforts....great benefits and union representation.  Seniority is huge here and it take some time and efforts before the job finally pays off!"
good,I liked working at UPS from the time I was there. I was well liked and always kept busy. It would be a job I would recommend to a friend or family member.
good,A great career job with benefits and the staff is always willing to help you out. You can learn life skills and works skills overall. you can take care your family with this career.
good,"The time I've spent here was enjoyable in the beginning. I've started at 19, and now I'm 21 ready to leave. Over time, you'll realize, it's taking a toll on you. Sometimes work will get very heavy, and I mean the building is backed up. Leaving you to hold a section by yourself while the supervisor of your area is helping another area that's backed up as well. Honestly pace yourself is all I can say."
good,"I worked there for nearly 3 years and was one of the most senior loaders working that shift. I personally enjoyed the high paced work but, felt that we should be paid more due to how stressful and hectic it turned out to be."
good,"Easy money for anyone willing to work. Work heavy under light supervision. Lots of room for promotion, ins, 401k, discounts. One of the best Jobs iv had."
good,"United Parcel Service is a fair and adequate place to work that allows motivated individuals to propel themselves to higher levels of employment within the company. That being said however, as with many locations there is qualms with said employer; this can include but is not limited to abuse of power by higher level employees/managers and likewise personnel. Overall I truly enjoyed working there and was on my way to a higher position but knew that the long term picture within the company was not my vision."
good,"Started working while I was in school and continued for a total of 8 years. Full time positions were slow in coming. When I was next in line to become a driver, I chose to leave and start my first construction company."
good,A good place to work for that helps you learn as well as advancing your career.Employees are generally great to work with. I'd say the company is in need of better compensation though.
good,"I was a package sorter, physically demanding, but I liked it. I learned to work independently and as a team. My supervisor was a fair and kind person."
good,"you come in and load or unload a 53 foot trailer, you never really knew what you would be doing that day. its hot and fast paced. great benefits if you can make it"
good,"UPS is well structured, fast paced environment where we must always be focused on maintaining production while focusing on safety expectations."
good,"Very boring job, picking up boxes and putting them down, can kinda get repetitive. For me i just couldn't do it any longer. just a very stable, day to day doing the same thing."
good,"Environnement plaisible "
good,Go in to work at least 10 minutes before your starting time just to get situated. grab you device and log in. check your rout for any changes or stops that you need to make. check your truck for any pakages that don't belong.
good,"Everyday of the week is a different start time, very fast paced but it is a very good way to become active and fit. Learning to carry the weight is the hardest part but once you get it under control becomes easy going, you won't notice the time."
good,I had good run at ups the customer was great and the van was very good the supervisor was ok my co -works was awesome I could get a little stressful at times
good,"I did early morning preload. Simple as you get.  Take packages off truck or load 3 delivery trucks.  The more packages for the day, the faster you gotta work.  Its not rocket science, and you do not get paid a rocket scientists pay.  No entitlement babies here.  Work hard and go home.  They treat you.very good if yoy.do your job and help others.  It is a physically demanding job.  It can be very stressful when it feels like every package is for your 3 trucks and you dont want to stop that belt... they just keep coming and before you know it there are mountains of pagkages at the back of your trucks and youre like ""when is this gonna end????""  But then you get a break in the action or someone will come to help and it gets done.  Not a fan of those days but you take the good with the bad.  Nobody is a real jerk so the atmosphere is great."
good,It’s a workout. Part time 3 and a half hours of work. Fast paced. Be prepared to come home sore and tired. Be ready to lift heavy boxes. We get packages that are about 120lbs
good,"Good job if it's your first time working, it can be stressful but what job isn't. I made the best out of it and made it through. Mines was really stressful because ups relocated me."
good,"fast paced environment & fun work place. work culture is very equal and friendly "
good,Just go to work and work dont play around while your there and you will stay out of trouble. It's a cool place to work if you dont mind the hard work and the early morning hours
good,hard job but rewarding at the end of the day when your package car is empty.  wish there was a way for me to keep working there.  but it was only for the holiday time.  and I was not needed any more
good,"UPS was a fast rate environment that had mandatory requirements the employees needed to meet such as 350 packages per hour rate, and also follow the 8 keys to lifting and lowering and the 5 keys to slips and falls."
good,"Ups was a fun yet challenging job, like many you have to start at the bottom and work your way up. I started as an unloaded of semis to becoming a revenue Auditor before I was done."
good,"Company is great, but the pay could be better. Hated to leave, but not enough to support a family off. Have to be an employee for years to see the good pay. You can move up quickly."
good,High demand and very stressful at times.  They expected perfection all the time and threatened to fire if it was not met.  Very hard at times to relax and enjoy.
good,I only worked at UPS for about a month but I can definitely say that they treat their employees well. A typical day for me entailed riding along with a UPS driver and delivering parcels during peak season. It was very fast paced and strenuous but I had fun doing it.
good,The people of ups are great to work with but not everyone is on the same page. The line of communication at times can be terrible without giving proper instruction
good,I was an Driver's Helper so the job was much fast-paced and mostly on an everyday route. I learned that boxes have to lift from the legs up and to always hold the boxes from each corner. The mangers was good people and very respectful. The hardest part about working at there was the fact the you had to stack a load of boxes on a pulley and make sure the boxes was on correctly or the would fall over. The most enjoyable part about the job was seeing the same face of people that knew who you were everyday.
good,I needed a part time and this job keeps me in shape and allows me the free time needed to complete my side job. It's good if you have alot of things going on in your personal life.
good,Lot of opportunity for advancement if you stay focused on your own career.  You have to manage your own career closely and hold your management team accountable to your career goals through one to one discussions.
good,"UPS is a very high paced place to work, it is very stressfull. I worked with alot of good people that was the only thing that kept the stress to a minimum."
good,The job had nice pay for the position.  Very quick paced.  24x7 support meant being on call for most times except during vacation.  Felt squeezed between unions and upper management.
good,"A typical day for a part time supervisor was kind of stressful for the job classification of a part-time employee. The day would begin with a meeting with your bosses, and explanation of the goals that were required to be meet as well as planning on how to achieve the goals. Next, we would grab papers for documentation as well as equipment for employees, and then run an operation, performing evaluations and talk-withs with employees, checking up, giving feedback and if needed discipline, safety checks daily were required for employees as well as equipment. After the operation was done, we would pay our employees head to the office and complete the paperwork assigned to us, as well having a post-sort meeting to explain success and failures. I learned a lot from many people, both great and well not so great. I made a lot of good friends out of bosses, and met amazing bosses who deeply cared for me. I will never forget them, especially for teaching me many life-valuable skills that I still apply to this day."
good,"I enjoy working at UPS.It is a physically demanding job, but I enjoy working hard with some good people.I would love to get on full-time there. Being a driver is goal."
good,"You get there load trailers for about 5 hours and you go home. Takes about a month to get used to the job, but if you are in shape it's easy. Dress according to the weather, wear layers in the winter."
good,With a Job like this There should be overtime or at lease not a hassle like everyone isnt doing there job when the computer specifically shows that we are making it into our stops at the reasonably time
good,"'ve been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with UPS FREIGHT TRUCKLOAD very much. Everyone I work with is nice and easy to get along with."
good,Fast paced and labor intensive.  Must be able to learn on the fly.  Breaks are 10 minutes and not nearly long enough.  Flexible hours though that works well for people who have alternative employment.
good,"Only been working here for 4-5 months. Love the people I work with. Wish full time associates are given health benefits. I like that where I work I don’t have to pay for copies or printing. Its slow paced, unless it’s the holidays. There is opportunity for overtime. You may receive a tip excellent customer service."
good,"very fast paced, can be stressful but rewarding. not for the weak- willed, ability tot ransfer buildings, quick opportunity for advancement. Decent benefits and paid time off."
good,"In this company, you have to be willing to invest personal time to set yourself up for success and or the opportunity for advancement. Rarely are people hired off the street and decisions are usually made based on seniority."
good,Working off an assembly line isn't always the best thing to work off especially when there are a lot of packages for your truck. The belt moves quick also.
good,It was a good job.Real productive and time went by real fast cause you never stopped unless it was break time. Always busy no real down time. keep working and there was no problems
good,Job was very fast paced depending on your area. Very rewarding at the end of your shift. Job could be very stressful depending on management style but job is very doable.
good,"A typical day at UPS was loading and unloading packages from semi truck trailers. I learned a lot of new skills working for UPS, Management was very helpful and supportive and encouraging. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was part time hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work out!"
good,"Good job for seasonal. The work isn't as hard as it's made out to be. Once you find a rhythm you will be fine. The people are helpful, they make sure you know what your doing (if you don't know what your doing you will be in the way). Supervisors are helpful and make sure your doing well. For the most part it's a cool environment."
good,Great company with challenging metrics. Culture of United Parcel Service is deeply rooted within all facets of the organization.  Provides excellent leverage when looking for advancement.
good,"UPS isnt for everyone. If you dont mind hard work, ok hours except during the holiday season, working out for a living, then ups is definitely a place for you"
good,"I was scheduled 7am-5pm Monday thru Friday, never left before 7pm.  No flexibility with family, I was an Account Executive.  Family was not first for management.  Other than that great benefits and pay.  For me money is not everything.  Can't buy piece of mind."
good,"Its a physically demanding job but very easy to do.  Just go in, do your work, and leave.  The pay is fair, the management is decent, and the benefits are great.  I still consider this my fallback job in life."
good,I only left UPS because I wanted to return to the States where my family was.  They would not relocate me in the U.S. again due to Company need.after18 months in Holland I chose to leave.
good,Long hours . Learned a lot of problem solving skills . Management is very strict. workplace culture is very competitive. hardest part of the job is the long hours.
good,"I would recommend this job to those who will be energized and is focused , as this job can blow out your energy very quick . It’s a friendly job, you will make friends"
good,The work was ok. Not enough hours and it was a seasonal job only. Having to meet the driver at various locations along the route was dumb. They should have you start from the beginning each day.
good,Could give more hrs to there employees but only through peak season you will be granted over time working more than 40 plus hours a week..............
good,"Responsible for promoting safe and clean working environment.Directed a team of 100 skilled workers to ensure quality,compliance and safety.Notified supervisors of faulty operations and defective materials."
good,"Working for UPS, they work with your schedule, and you work so hard that you lose weight. The job is motivating and fast paced. UPS is a good company to work for."
good,"You spend 4 hours quickly loading boxes in order on the truck. Normal it is not too hard and the day goes by quickly. However, if you get a lot of stuff all at once, it makes everything harder and more stressful. Management is hit or miss depending on how much they stand up for you to corporate. "
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, it was a laid back and also fast paced environment that was flexible with hours and understood if you had a sick day. They also worked with you and helped you with training."
good,Not enough hours  they made supervisors work and would cut us out at 5 1/2 hours which is not enough for me to live off of a week. I’m looking for more hours
good,"The only real negatives about my job are the lack of work/life balance, and the amount of money I make for what I do. I am responsible for over 1200 employees, at any other company, I would be making nearly twice what I do now."
good,"After arriving everyday we do daily stretches. Then we proceed to our positions. Once everyone is in position the belt begins, the unloaders begin to unload, scanners scan, and loaders load. I am located between the scanners and must address correct anything that is incorrect. (We know this because the scanner places a label on each package.) In order to correct the address we sometimes have to look it up on  google, ask managers, or drivers. I am also responsible for repackaging any damaged packages. If a package is  out of range or does not belong on one of our trucks I must scan it at send it to proper location."
good,I was only a seasonal employee so I can only say what it was like around Christmas time but during that time there were more packages to sort than I was able to keep up with and would occasionally pile up over me but on the other hand there were times where I was just sitting there waiting for something to do.
good,"its a good career that you would have to be working for a long time for it to be worth it but not enough pay or hours , and it was very unorganized at times"
good,"the work was hard ,and long. not my style of work, management was a little bit unorganized. but the fact that I have the experience under my belt counts!!"
good,"The UPS Store was a great place to learn quite a bit of skills. As a clerk, I aided customers with shipping and delivery, but also helped close up the store at the end of the day, including balancing registers and locking down the shop. Naturally stressful during holidays but otherwise quite relaxed."
good,"Overall, my impression is comfortable and welcoming. I receive the right kind of support, which makes working for this company easier. So far, I can see myself working long term."
good,i Enjoyed working at UPS. There is always work available. Great work environment nice people all around who were willing to ask answer qustions and help out with any questions i had.
good,I learned about loading a 53 trailer the hardest part was the hour of the job working graveyard the manager is okay at times very helpful and caring  i love the job just not enough hour
good,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal driver's helper. It was a hands on job gotta be able to know how to handle a dolly.  Lift up the fifty pound, also be good with strategizing."
good,"UPS seemed like a really good job, but the management was poor and unprofessional. They were pigs and being in a management position didn't stop them."
good,"Worked this year as a driver helper, layed off on Christmas eve. Not a bad part time job, don't balance what management tells you about fulltime hire on, they give you the run around."
good,I was a driver helper for UPS for about a month during the holiday season. It is very fast paced and some of the days can go very long due to a lot of delivery.
good,"UPS is a fast paced work environment that requires hours of moving and standing constantly, no matter the weather no matter the workload everyday is workday."
good,Early Hours but super worth it because an hour in and you are getting the work out of your life. Good job if you like to sweat and dont have a problem getting dirty
good,"Ups is a great career to have if you enjoy driving, and interacting with people. You must be well organized. Safety always comes first when you're on that truck."
good,"Professionally, I grew and learned the most from UPS. My time there is invaluable. Working beside seasoned sales professionals and under their mentorship, UPS has brought up my business acumen and perfected my negotiation skills. However, there were too many meetings that felt unnecessary and too much red tape at times. But even the negatives was a learning experience. Overall great experience and professional incubator for me."
good,"This company has great benefits as long as you are willing to do the work. The advancement they provide in the company is good as well but you do have to juggle with other people who have advanced. The job isn't for the weak minded because there are people their who'll try to push you to the edge, but you just got to stay focus on the reason your there which is for the great beneits."
good,one i thing i can say about ups was the training i loved the training they taught us very well. i learned about new machines that i didn't even know about. the management was ok really didn't like there attitude at times. the workplace culture was a 6 out of 10 ill say. the job wasn't really hard so yea. the most enjoyable part about the job was the break time lol.
good,I would learn how to sort things quickly as well as how to load and unload trucks properly. While loading I would have to fit as many boxes as possible in a wall and proceed to fix it so that it was solid and would not collapse in the back of the truck.
good,I enjoyed working for ups. It was alot of footwork and had to move quickly pay attention to where packages was going and deliver on time and safely Helping driver with a large amount of packages to deliver
good,As a ups driver helped the driver with packages and putting them in order that goes with the addresses he was giving me. As I put them in order he stops at one address scans the box I hop off and the customer receives their package.
good,There is great opportunity for those who are willing to work at what will be the hardest physical job most people will ever work.  The up side is the ability to gain full medical coverage with a very competitive wage even while working part time.
good,UPS is a fast paced job that is quick to hire you and will give you the hours you need if you are a skilled employee. Work days vary in length because our shift leaves depending how fast we finish our work load. The people are easy to work with and overall it's a decent job.
good,I enjoy it and would very much like to stay there. I am only leaving because the job is seasonal. I am going to apply for both part time and full time positions.
good,This job can be a lot better if the management actually cares for their workers. But other then that very fast advancement good benefits all in all its an OK place to work.
good,I loved thus job just needed more pay at the time. All in all this was the best job i had get one truck rone your self and move to the next truck and help others.
good,"fast pace, laid back environment"
good,"The pay gets better with more seniority and more advancement opportunities come open the longer you stay. Culture is decent, team work is a huge key to UPS."
good,ups is a very physical job. your required be able to lift 70 pounds minimum for the spot. its also fast paced and you work about 5 hours a day if your part time.
good,"UPS offers diversity but it is not suitable for everyone. While the foreign managers normally leave you alone, you do not always get the sense of satisfaction you desire."
good,My typical work day would consist of reading and scanning labels on packages while loading them into the correct trailer so they can be delivered on time.
good,To work at UPS you have to be a self motivated person. This is not a job that you can relax at. The safety and wellbeing of yourself and others plus the companies equipment  and reputation is something you have to always consider. It is a very good job.  But it demands a lot of your time. Which can make it harder than some jobs. Especially on your family. All in all it's a good job great benefit great pay salary or hourly.
good,"J'ai bien aimé travailler chez UPS, par contre, le salaire et le nombre d'heures ne me satisfaisaient aucunement"
good,Travailler pour cette compagnie m'a permis d'améliorer plusieurs aspects de ma personne. Je recommande cette compagnie à tous.
good,UPS is very fast paced work environment.  You have to assist both drivers and customers. For this job I learned to multitask.  The one thing bad about this job is that the pay is too low.
good,The hardest part of my job was managing people in multiple states. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people. We have a work relationship that exceeds most teams.
good,UPS is an established company with a solid foundation.  It was a good place to work with plenty of opportunity available within the company.  The pay was decent and the benefits were very good.
good,"The hours were not that great, and the management was sometimes disconnected, but the benefits were hard to beat.  Also, there were many opportunities for advancement."
good,"fast paced, always changing work environment. office and physical work. long hours and heavy workload. great health care benefits among the top 2 of all employers I've worked for . competitive pay and opportunities to grow within the company. company prefers to hire from within."
good,Fast pace environment that can be fun as long as you know your job and you get along with management. Workplace could use an update but overall a safe place to work.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for as it is a union company and because of that job security is very high here. The work can be tough on your body, but once accustomed to the work load its not so bad."
good,"Opportunity to gain work experience with Hazardous Materials and insight with how this company works from the customer, ground, tractors to the air transportation."
good,"Its a great place to work, just wish that they would offer more hours for people with disability's. To us who need the hours instead of hiring temps.."
good,UPS was a great company to work for. I learned a lot and had a good opportunity for promotion. They had good internal training and one distinct msg. Very busy over the holidays...
good,They want to work you very hard and fast they don’t want you standing around doing anything if you do they going to say what you doing and do something put your hand on something
good,The UPS store is a fine job to have as an employee. The hours are not intrusive into personal time. There is opportunity to advance but only within the realm of the franchise.
good,"If you want to work hard then UPS is the place for you.  Lots of work, but pay and benfits are more than fair. Great place for young, healthy people to start out."
good,The supervisors and managers are very helpful and work with you to make sure you know the job as well as possible. They also do very extensive training and won’t just leave you if you are struggling.
good,"Decent pay for Part-time work. Full Benefits and Union package, and information provided about other job openings/departments if you're looking to advance into management or logistics. Work-School reimbursements options available. The job is often fast paced and more physical/labor intensive than most people assume."
good,Hard work loading and unloading trucks in the Houston hub in that heat. The quota they wanted was ridiculously high and you had to work like a dog from the time you got there until you were released.
good,"Great Pay/Benefits. Very physically demanding job. For part time work, you will either work very early in the mornings or late into the evenings. Drivers average 10 hour work days."
good,Working at UPS as a part-time supervisor was a great experience from me.  I got the opportunity to lead people and work as a team with my coworkers.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the people that work there.  Everyone at the company was great and helpful in anything that I needed.  The hardest part of the job was working for a micromanaging supervisor.  I got a sense that they did not trust me with the tasks that they entrusted me with.
good,hard work.keeps you physically in shape.difficult to deal with management.benefits are far superb to any other company from what i hear. would not have left if I didnt get caught in unfortunate circumstances
good,"A typical day at work would be, first  listen to the plan for the day. Grab my scanner, make sure it work properly, then I  go to the assign door. Then I would scan the bar code to the location I was assigned to load or unload. "
good,"This position is not for everyone, as it can be physically taxing on the body. You spend your work time lifting and moving packages, which can get up to 70lbs and sometimes well over 70lbs."
good,I like working there the workers there are are pretty cool people and they all welcomed me in and made me feel comfortable. They’re are really flexible if you need time off when is a plus.
good,Decent Union company with good benefits. I learned teamwork and a hard days work along with lots of friendly coworkers. Working there is overall entertaining with good benefits
good,I am very grateful for the opportunity to work at UPS and it has allowed me grow in many areas of my life.  It is a fast pace environment and you must come in willing to go the extra mile because UPS is going through a major transition and a lot of the knowledge has retired since we just has a lot of retirees in August.  It can be a great place to work.  It's what you make it.
good,I loved the public contact and the office assistant help that I was able to provide to the public.  To pack and ship was a great part of the business.  I was very happy to receive packages and deliver to the customers was very rewarding part of the job
good,if you are looking for a fast paced work out then this is the job for you. if you dont like working hard and sweating then this job isnt for you. cold in the winter hot in the summer.
good,"If you enjoy moving objects several times a day from one spot to another, weighing from a simple letter to a literal 150+ pound slab of metal in less than a few seconds, this place'd be perfect for you. My overall enjoyment with the place was fine, it was a place to work and nothing more or less. They work you around 4 - 6 hours max, with an alright pay. For a job to look for another job, it was great for quick pay to get by but not something to live off of. Management was simple, you had one person who made sure you were doing your job right and what you can improve on. Other than that, they really served no other purpose to you other than to talk too. It can be hit or miss with majority of the managers as some can be very likable to others being... Brash and harsh. Regardless, the workplace itself varies when it comes to the culture. It all depends on the area you work in. Cultures fluctuated depending on the area of work you were in, so, hope that you can manage to fit in... Otherwise, good luck and keep your music nearby. Though, as long as you can provide proper communication to fellow team members, it's easy to power through the few hours. Hardest part? The work itself really. It all depends on how well you can keep up truly. If your will to work is high? The shift should be quick and time flies. Feeling low? Well... Prepare for a long day. The most enjoyable parts were being able to chat with good folk and learning the best ways to complete the tasks and create your own strategies. And the feeling of completing an entire truck all on your own? Knowing you did it all yourself"
good,Fun filled place! If your looking for a full time job apply there! They are super fun and nice people. Easy to get along with also! They always satisfy their customers
good,"If you can make it to your 1 year mark, the health benefits are great. Low copays at doctors, very low to none payments on prescriptions. However, it is a very loud & dusty facility. You will meet some great people & a lot of not so great people. The management isnt all that great. Part time supervisors are generally really nice & good, full timmers and up are a big pain in the butt to deal with. There is oppertunties to learn & grow within the company. Whether it's getting promoted to a part time supervisor or a full time loader/unloader (granted it takes years to make full time), or even being trained & certificated at different job tasks throughout your work area. There's always plenty of things to learn."
good,If you are a recent high school graduate looking for ways to pay for further education then UPS is the place for you. With plenty of part time opportunities available UPS offers plenty of options to work around your school schedule. Benefits are amazing if you can make it through your probationary period. It's a difficult work environment that is fast paced and constantly changing.
good,$44 Billion Corporation with fair compensation - idea work environment for young hard working professional seeking career in Logistics and Transportation.
good,"would start late in the evening and would work non-stop for 3 hours lifting the packages, we work efficiently and effectively in our team, making sure everything is to standard"
good,UPS is a very large company where you feel like to be a part of a family.  There is always new challenges awaiting and a lot of possibilities for advancements.
good,"Very hard working entry job, but it combines hard work with some communication initiations, recommended work methods, and teamwork to get the job done and go home safely."
good,Overall the pay and raise schedule was fair at UPS. The benefits package was the best part of working for UPS. Part time supervisors did the best they could but were often unable to accomplish the requests of upper management due to unrealistic expectations. The job was labor intensive and the AM work schedule was not well suited to rest and family life.
good,"help customers with orders to pack and ship as needed, management is friendly, also most of the drivers picking up are helpful. Its laid back. Some difficult customers."
good,"•	Loaded trucks and ensured parcels were packed in delivery route order"
good,Working in transportation is a challenge but it's a fun one that involves problem solving and collaboration.  It's stressful but for the most part fair.
good,"Part time positions are great, you work about 4 hours a day but you are lifting very heavy packages and takes a toll on your body over time. Management is always pushing you to go faster!"
good,"Start Early in the morning, very fast paced load trucks in a timely manner, be able to be quick thinking and have a little pep in your step. over all it a good job for people someone who need a little more money in their pocket"
good,Everything is good about working at UPS besides the pay. They don't pay enough money for you to live on unless your putting in overtime or have been an employee for 5 years and plus.
good,Learned more then I could have possibly imagined from working at UPS.  The managment skills and the ability to operate are invauable skills I have uses after leaving.
good,I enjoyed working at UPS but I wasn't getting enough hrs and I was driving there and sometime there wasn't any work so it's ok for whomever likes to work short term hrs
good,"I am only part time with no plans on driving. I would like a full time spot at the hub. As a Teamster you recieve excellent benefits, but every year is a toss up because of changing contracts."
good,"Fast paced retail location, family owned and operated for 20+ years.  Fun environment with flexible hours.  You will be trained in office skills (copying, faxing, word processing, multi phone line) as well as packaging and shipping"
good,"The cleaning service I worked for, had a contract with UPS. The company always paid on time and was a pretty good, cleaning contract. The people there were always good to me."
good,"Ups was a very quick paced and competitive place to work, it was a good experience for me because I learned how to be responsible for my trailers as time passed on. I thought of that as a great opportunity for my self."
good,"It is a good job if you can work at odd hours. It will require heavy physical work and it will fast-paced. If one can survive the first few days, it will be a very good job."
good,Fairly routine job.  Following trucks from one point to another. Very little interaction with management. I've learned the business of package handling and transport.
good,"UPS is very fast paced and they will ride you if you’re not moving fast enough. But you can not beat the benefit after a year full medical, dental, and vision for your family no money a month. That is for a part time job."
good,"Great place to work, the people are great as well...the operation runs smoothly and efficiently...high speed environment...team building as well as good incentives"
good,"- A typical day at  work would be me unloading a truck or Scanning packages and putting them in the right area."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS, but it's difficult to get hired on there full-time.  They will temp you though, so if you're ok with that, you'll probably like working there. I primarily inbounded trailers via computer and did generic paperwork.  The last hour of my shift was to check trailers, which was easy, but you needed to be careful not to fall."
good,"Hard work at a extremely fast pace with know room for growth in the first 8yrs of employment. Must work in all types of weather conditions hot ,cold, wind etc. Would like to see more opportunities for warehouse staff better wages."
good,"The job is easy in the sense that their is time to learn. But the pay is not the greatest and there is a high demand to learn quickly for what you are being paid. Rather than just being a cashier you sort packages, pack boxes and sort mail. It has good hours but the management of the job is not the best and the pay is not great either."
good,I had some good and bad days. Most days we would get a lot of volume. I also enjoyed their free morning snacks. It was a great job to start your career of right.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you need the benefits.   Everyone starts out part time in the union.  If you make it through the initial 30 days of training you get hired on and can promote as soon as there's an opening.  If you have another part time job and are looking for the best benefits you could imagine, UPS is the company for you."
good,This is a good job. The hours are flexible and the management works with you to make sure everything lines up. The store gets busy but with the right people working everything goes smoothly.
good,"UPS is fast paced, there is a lot of turnover but the work isn’t difficult. I feel like people just made it hard just because. Management position is stressful but if you like working under pressure, leading a team, managing multiple things at the same time then you’d enjoy it. Good hours, good overtime and good pay. If you work hard, do your job, and be a company person then you will get moved up"
good,Great job that you Can Work At and experience For Yourself .but other then that they also train you so you can actually wear steel toe Boots long pants and some gloves for the Boxes.
good,"Drivers always lookout for each other and help others when needed. I remember while working at UPS, other driver will come to me with their trucks to pick up some loads of work from me. Really meant a lot."
good,"unload 18 wheeler freight trucks, place boxes on the first belt with package label facing up so the next man can scan the package. The package is then moved to the main belt where it is picked up by loaders and loaded onto delivery trucks (three trucks per person)"
good,"Fast paced, great place to work if you want to work out, great hours, work as a team to get things done. The pay is ok 30 min break warehouse environment"
good,"Work fast, but don't make mistakes! They told me how much they appreciated my hard work and that I would be kept on after the holidays, but when the end of the season came that didn't happen. two weeks later they called to ask me to come back, but I had already found a permanent position elsewhere. "
good,Currently. I have only been working with UPS for a few weeks. I can definitely see myself advancing at this job into becoming a truck driver for UPS. This is a great job.
good,"I did not work for UPS. I worked for UPS Store, which are independantly owned and operated. These are two different entities. I don't know what else to say."
good,"UPS is a fast-paced place to work if you chose to accept the Package Handler or Driver Helper position. You must unload trucks from the time they get there until the last truck is empty. Sometimes, I started at 12:30am and stayed until 9am unloading. The management could be a little bit better at the center I worked for, but the belt supervisor I worked directly under was helpful and hardworking."
good,"Worked city, was fun but very fast paced and not easy work.  Lots of inside deliveries and residentials."
good,"Its a good career to have good pay, benefits, and retirement.  Long hours and physical work.  Overall it's a fair environment just a very demanding job when it comes to production."
good,"I don't want to write a review of this company. Even though anonymous, I still do work here and good, bad, or indifferent I dont want to write a review."
good,"I go to work at 4am, help load the trucks and at 9am I start delivering the freight.  I travel my route, greet my customers, and deliver packages.  Some of the hardest parts of my job is the trucks are not power steering, and the package weight range from 3 pounds to 150 pounds.  I weigh 150 pounds.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making new friends with my friendly customers."
good,We would unload and load trailer for about five hours a day. I learned how to think on the fly and how to time management. The hardest part of the job was just the summer time heat.
good,"I love my job ,the people I work with and the work I do. They are very big on safety and I always feel appreciated for the hard work I do and I love the fact there's room for advancement and education."
good,"18-24 hours a week, would have liked more hours"
good,Productive and fast pace work. Loading Package on to Ups belt. Learning new thing and new skills in the company. Great people to work with. Sometimes long hours.
good,hours are good for people looking for a early morning job who also want to maintain another job or obligation in life. the pay is also very good for the work you'll be doing.
good,"I liked my job I was there for 9 years, the only reason I left was my family was getting bigger and I needed a full time job. I'd probably go back if they offered 40 hours or more."
good,"Although this job is very taxing to the amount of rest you get and risk of injury, they pay well for your efforts. There is room for advancement andthey offer benefits after a certain amount of time of working there."
good,"I enjoy the job for what its worth. a typical day at work is good labor, management can be trying but it's part of the job, they have quotas. the hardest art of the job is getting the trailers broken down correctly and in a timely manner."
good,"This job brings in many types of employees. While this can be challenging or discouraging, it really allows the strong, motivated employees to stand out and make a big difference."
good,Supervised and trained drivers on proper delivery methods. Taught people skills. Culture was a negative union environment. Work/life balance was very difficult to maintain. Friendships built was the most favorable part of job.
good,UPS is a good company however I have more responsibilities coming such as buying my moms medication. i need to be more practical rather than waiting and waiting to be promoted. instead if i can go abroad so i can meet the requirements that i need to meet the responsibilities needs
good,"At first the job can be a bit overwhelming just because of all the information you have to know about the different services. Once you have learned about the services then you can really have fun. You get to know the customer and why they are sending what they are sending. Each person is different and has a different story to go along with their package. The manager is easy to get along with and understands that there is a life outside of work that we all have. The hardest part of the job is handling the people who come in upset and confused about the fact that "" The UPS Store"" is not ""UPS."" They think you can do whatever it is UPS does to get their package there immediately! The best part of the job is meeting people who become regulars and you create this bond with who become your friends and care about your day."
good,The work is hard and the benefits are good. You'll meet all different kinds of people. The Union is strong and you can learn a lot. There are lots of opportunities to further your education as well.
good,decent pay and a good work environment. they were always willing to train on new things and help where needed. holiday time has a lot of opportunities for overtime.
good,"Solid growth-oriented company with a very promising future. Difficult work, high standards but worthwhile. Great benefits and prospects. Inter-personal relationships tend to be a bit suspect."
good,"UPS was a great company to work for. It was an office/call center environment so there could be drama. Posisitions opened up but usually you was pushed in a direction good for the company, not necessarily what you would want to do . Pay and benefits were good. There was always mandatory overtime, making very long work weeks. The position was handling hostile customers that could be draining and not a fun work environment."
good,This environment is very simple that ask for simple things but a lot of activities at once. This environment can quickly become a fast paced environment and a hectic one as well
good,"If your looking for something fast paced this is the one for you. Even better than going to the gym and I got paid for working out. I put in 16,000 steps per part-time day."
good,"Like the job just was part-time, they people are friendly.  Have to work hard at a timely pace. No lunch break but you do get two breaks. The pay was good for part-time, and management and leads we're nice. I enjoyed working for ups"
good,"This was a part time position during the Holidays, the driver I was assigned to was very professional, very knowledgeable, I felt we worked well together."
good,"There are lots of career opportunities "
good,"-Fun to do, if you're looking to gain muscle and lose weight."
good,"Great place to work overall, strenuous. Not really for physically inept people. Conditions inside the jub must improve and so must management and union relations."
good,I picked up this job between my fall and spring semester to earn a little extra money the hiring process was quick but the position is temporary. I worked directly with the drivers and they were always nice.
good,"Basically we have to work at a fast pace in order to meet a deadline of the delivery, thou being an unloader gives me a good work out it's wages are not enough to make a life for my self so work a job like this is only meant to be a side job."
good,"typical day at ups involves preparing the slides for packages, making sure i have all equipment and arriving on time. The hardest part of the day is towards the end.. everything gets really slow and the day drags."
good,"Hourly: job is very physically demanding at first. As soon as your body gets used to it it's not too bad. "
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. Although it is a physically demanding job, UPS provides a friendly, easy going work environment. the income and benefits are also great. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"UPS is a company that specializes in parcel express deliveries. i worked for the company for a short time as a Driver Helper, i enjoyed working for them because i got to interact with lots of customers and i was not in one place for a long time. The hours were good and very balanced for me. The only problem was they didnt pay me for all the hours i worked, i think they took advantage because i was very young and i was very new to the working world as it was my first job."
good,"I liked working at UPS. The work was pretty straightforward, and the co-workers were great. The store was clean and easy to move around in and easy to keep track of where stuff ways. The hard part of the job was the customers. Many were rather rude, or downright angry and were not willing to listen to suggestions. On the other hand, there were also several wonderful customers who were nice and easy to talk to. It would get pretty busy during breaks and holidays but otherwise, the flow was pretty easy."
good,"In all honesty its what you make out of your time working there. Some people, like myself are in there for the benefits (insurance, tuition assistance, etc.) and as soon as they get their fill they go find other employment. The problem with job is the amount of physical effort that is put in doesn't match the paycheck that you receive. There are times working there that you will injure yourself whether that be a heavy package hitting you, or just soreness from the job itself it doesn't feel like the amount of effort is worth it. The workplace depends on how well you can deal with other people"
good,working hours were good for me. pay was descent. managers were helpful.  union for some jobs. co-workers were good. no room for advancement because you have to wait on the union.
good,"a decent place to work unless you have a family that you wish to spend time with on a regular basis, but if you are single then it is a great job and can pay quite well."
good,"Definitely a good environment for a first job.  You learn a lot of vital skills and how to deal with clients, think on your feet and work with others."
good,"Fairly good company to work for while beginning college. they have a great college reimbursement program of up to $2,500 a semester. The only problem is you have to work every weeknight with very physically tiring work."
good,"It was a good place to work with the coworkers I had. They help break up the monotony. There was a lot of learning as you go, not a whole lot of training and there was a lot of blaming when you messed due to lack of training. There was not enough praising or bonuses and no compensation for certificates obtained. There is potential to stay a UPS for a long period of time."
good,"As a business major, The UPS Store gave me incredible insight to the world of marketing, management, and small business growth. Working my way up the management ladder, I was exposed to many different methods and tactics for growth you can't exactly learn in a classroom."
good,"Physical work, only someone with lots of stamina and strength can do a job like this. Its a bit dangerous with boxes lying everywhere. Take advantage of those health benefits, they are the best thing this job has to offer."
good,"Even though I worked there for a short time, my responsibilities were simple and the environment wasn't very stressful. In addition, my supervisors were very relaxed and joked around with me a lot; this helped me feel like I was hanging out with friends at work (something that can really ease your stress - especially during the holidays when the company is at its busiest). I did have to work extra hard because I was a seasonal employee, which means I had various roles assigned to me, but, ultimately, the assignment were fairly easy to do, albeit physically demanding. Overall, I enjoyed working there, and would consider working there again."
good,"Pretty Phisical work should be done during the early morning hours. If you have cholesterol problem, it is a nice place for regular work-out. Pay is not bad."
good,"Overall it has been a good first job especially while i am attending school. Job is mostly physical, but requires some training and thinking. Pay could be better as we seem to end up doing more then job listing."
good,"The position was very busy with lots of multi-tasking. The company provided excellent health benefits."
good,"The pay is good, with great benefits. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a decent pay to this job. Even though you work very hard, its worth it."
good,great pay and benefits. but the union sonority to be available for you to work is the worst. you start as part time and takes years to get full time work.
good,Hard to get consistent hours when you start out. Very fast paced but much easier once you learn the route your are one. cant have any wasted time or you fall behind in your time schedule.
good,it was ok I feel like if I didn't get hurt the way I did I could have been further in the company but things happen you live and you learn. had fun met great people and wish everyone there the best!
good,I worked 5 days a week was paid we'll just you came home super exhausted from what seemed like not a whole lot of actual labor. I learned a lot about management in my time here.
good,"Good benefits , bad hours, fast paced, physical, stressful, loud, competitive, hot, angry, teamsters, unorganized, numbers driven, dangerous, frenzied"
good,"Its a great job and the work is acceptable. the managers are not so organized, and set in their ways. Each work day will most likely consist of ten to twelve hour shifts"
good,As a drivers helper your job is to help the driver get the packages off of the truck. The holiday season makes this role vital in getting the packages where they need to go.
good,Almost every day was different because I hardly stayed my 8 hours.I learned how to be organized and work at a fast pace. management was great and work culture was great too. The hardest part was when they mad you wrap by yourself. Other than that I enjoyed working there.
good,Fast paced job. Very fun and great environment.  The people are great and the work isn't bad. decent pay for a part time job also. the shift is pretty easy to get used to also.
good,"I was only a part time employee, while i was going to school, but while I was there it was a good job. You only work part time, the only drawback is that it is 3rd shift, but I would recommend that job to anyone, especially young college students."
good,"I liked working for UPS when I was in high school, but definitely not a permanent job position for me. The money isn’t enough and hours were not given to make more money."
good,don't like the hours if they had 1st shift hours I would be 100% content. the pay is great after 4 years but the progression period is ridiculous 50% of full scale and very little increases until 3rd year when at 70%. the benefits are top notch hard to find any comparable at other companies.
good,UPS is a great place to work. Its hard to get on for a reason. The work is hard but the training is good. The equipment is always in good shape and they pay is good.
good,"I overall enjoyed my working time at ups, however I would not recommend it to someone who has authority issues. Most of the managers made the work tolerable and sometimes enjoyable, but the overall building manager was not a good manager. I don’t say this just based on bad blood between us, but I often saw the regional manager irritated with the building manager."
good,"When I was a worker, my job was to load trucks with packages neat and orderly while remaining safe during each trip. Moving my way up the employment ladder to Supervisor and experiencing management for the first time was an altering transition."
good,"It is hard work but if you want a good workout and get paid for it, then this is a great opportunity! It gets busy during holidays. Make sure to bring water, because you will sweat! There are several different options of work hours. I just chose the overnight shift, so I knew I would only work Sunday night- Thursday morning- 1030 pm -3 am."
good,i was working on a night shift team .A freindly team which encourage you to do your work easily even if it appears to be very hard and demanding more efforts .You really need to be very fast especially when the trucks are queuing and waiting for places to load .The best moment is when everything is sorted before the limited time under pressure .
good,Me gustó mucho trabajar en UPS porque es una muy buena empresa
good,A great working place challenges you daily. Great ways to be promoted decent pay meet tons of great people. Can get overwhelming and you also get a nice workout
good,In a F/T management role expectations are very high. Usually hard to find a good work/home life balance. Truly you are never off the clock. Great work environment. Management and hourly usually operate under the same mentality.
good,"Enjoyed the job immensely - skills learned there have been used in multiple position since.  I still have a mailbox there, and get all of my printing jobs done there as well.  The managers are also the business owners and take their customer service very personally."
good,If you can’t work fast and pick up what is going on at UPS then it is not the job for you. You will be asked to do things at a fast pace and mistakes only make the job harder than what it is
good,"A typical day is to unload a trailer of boxes and envelopes, then move to the next trailer assigned to you by your lead person. My co workers were friendly and we would team up to unload the trailers.My lead person gave direction in a positive manner and would help complete the task as needed. I enjoyed my time working at UPS and have recommended to others to apply there for work."
good,"Nothing too crazy. This was your typical warehouse job. Working on the sorting line sorting boxes and bags to different belts color coded depending on the location of the item. Or unloading a truck by yourself or with a co-worker. Once your job is done, you leave"
good,I was a seasonal driver over Christmas. It was the most physically demanding job I have ever had and I was a carpenter for a while. It was fast paced and you had to keep up.
good,Awesome company. It would be better if it had full time position. Great opportunity to go to school since it's paid by the company. Hard on the body with all the lifting and lowering
good,Working for UPS isn't to bad except around the holidays.  You will be missing xmas eve with the family more than likely.  You will able to catch all the other holidays though.
good,I truly think that ups is a great place to work there are many job functions that anyone can find something they love to do. The one problem is the senior management that thinks it's ok to degrade lower management
good,I would recommend ups to anyone. Fast paced always on the go. The management was extremely helpful. I learned how the package cars were loaded and recieved.
good,This job is really hard because the of timing. Its 3 am in the morning and fast work but security is good and they warm yup before starting which is good for us.
good,Working at UPS can be demanding but it is a stable job with decent benefits. There is the opportunity for advancement but you have to put the energy into seeking it.
good,"Great company with great benefits and a long term career path.  There is great job security and opportunity for advancement.  However, there are some old school managers that need to move on to make room for forward thinkers.  The company understands that and is working towards retaining top talent."
good,Worked here directly after high school. I was a sorter... Like the job just wish it had some type of full time position. Understand why it doesn't though.
good,Empresa de transporte de mercancia mundial muy seguro en cuanto al transporte de mercancia se refiera
good,"Very fun, laid back atmosphere.  Management is very easy going, understanding and professional.   There is a positive work/life balance and I enjoy coming to work daily."
good,I was only a temp employee so I did not receive the same benefits as those employed directly by UPS. Many loved working there for their benefits. The community between employees is also very tight-knit.
good,"Kind of hard to learn the job, no orientation to advise about benefits, days off, etc. Much is learned as you go, no database to reference for job tools. Pretty much learn from asking others questions."
good,It was a great job and paid $10.50 an hour starting. But that doesn’t do you much good when you only get scheduled for 4-5 hours a day. Hours were difficult adjusting to
good,"working at the ups store was nice due to its light schedule. I'm currently going to school at the moment and having a lenient schedule was nice. However, this is a UPS store and is just a franchise which is independently owned. Meaning that the way the store works is up to the owner and not by the official UPS company."
good,"the driver i worked with was very easy to work with.  i like the compensation and health benefits.  the organization of the division i was placed in, needs work.  the trucks were not loaded properly, causing delays during deliveries"
good,"I have absolutely zero complaints for UPS. I understand I was seasonal, so I was really unable to receive the true benefits of working there. That being said, being a seasonal worker with UPS was my favorite working experience to this day."
good,"work culture is poor. Great benefits."
good,Worked with the driver to deliver packages to doors. Face paced. Could have been scheduled more hardest part was finding packages. Enjoyed the pay. Great place to work
good,"UPS isn't an easy company to work for due to the pressure put on management and the long hours worked.  There is a lot of non value added work that is put on the shoulders of managers.  That being said, you know what you sign up for and are compensated well.  The structure, image, and brand of the company is second to none."
good,"Great company to work for if you have the patience to wait for the full time position. Upper management is tough to please leaving the environment stressful, which is expected at a large company like this one. Other than that I have no complaints."
good,"Very fast-paced job. Unique personalities. Expected to get the job done. A lot of movement, no nonsense type of job. If you don't have a work ethic or a non-stop motor, this isn't the job for you."
good,"It is a great, secure company to work for. The company is very big on performance. The culture of the workplace if dependent on where you work. It changes from building to building."
good,very fast paced business to work for. they have hundreds of jobs not just for the recent college grad but for everyone. once u hit seniority u have options like working overtime and making even more money
good,"Typical day at work included packing and shipping peoples items. In charge if shipment and putting things away. In charge of going to the bank and opening and closing the store. In charge of copying peoples items and customizing them. Printing."
good,"UPS es una excelente empresa para laborar, pero las cargas de trabajo muchas veces exceden lo que un ser humano puede realizar durante su jornada laboral, por lo cual es necesario permanecer más tiempo que la jornada normal"
good,"The union and management are terrible. The job itself is okay. Sometimes it can be very fast paced and hard work, other times it is slow and easy. It is an okay place to work."
good,"A typical day was pretty tiring at first breaks were very short most people were nice others not so much ,management could've been a lot better , the hardest part of the job was the labor"
good,As a driver helper i would be picked up at a designated area and help the driver in his day to day deliveries. Dropping off packages at businesses as well a residential areas.
good,"It was a great experience for managing in a stressful environment. KPIs are instantaneously viewed in everyone's work area, so you have to be doing your job all day if you want to be really successful."
good,"Fast paced work environment with a lot of heavy lifting, communicating with your colleagues was essential for success, had to unload at least four hundred packages an hour. I worked the night shift 10pm- 3am. Part time was the only option they had for package handlers because it was so hard of a position."
good,"As a driver helper, I helped to deliver packages to businesses and homes. The route we went on was easy except one giant apartment complex that was gated. We had to walk almost all around the complex with numerous packages. Some of those packages were somewhere between 70 to 95 pounds but the labels would say 20 pounds, no one bothers to check the weight before loading the packages into the truck. At least most of the places we deliver are homes so it just takes seconds to get out of the truck to make the delivery and move on to the next."
good,"Very fast paced, competitive workplace. Good chance of advance while great benefits and wages. days can be long and required. Lots of customer service."
good,mi trovo molto bene a gestire questo lavoro.. sono dinamico e disponibile.
good,a typical day at work would be me going to the sort line and start sorting packages at a almost breakneck pace while the trucks were being unloaded. I also would train new employees in safe work techniques and work methods. I also would sometimes run a production line of men.
good,Work can be tough if you get behind and also can be frustrating when you have people you have to back up when they slack on what they are doing. Overall I enjoyed working there because I was with a good group of guys.
good,I was a local sort sup in Yuma az. It was a good place to work and great benefits. The center manager was a butt hole know it all lame. He didn't know jack squat.
good,"the job was seasonal, the work was not stressful, the managers were communicative, and the equipment was decent... the only part i did not care for was going through security check point to get in an out of the facility... the part i enjoyed the most was driving..."
good,"I worked a lot of hours and It was very very stressful. It was good inn the start but i felt like we were put to hard work, the pay didn't cover the emotional stress."
good,"Seeing if your route is in the Center for that day. Make sure required packages are on your truck. Daily checks prior to leaving facility. Maintain  safety during work day, meet deadlines prior to time. Complete requirements prior to punching out."
good,"Working at UPS means you would usually be doing a 5-6 hour shift, with different shifts, such as the Twilight hours or Midnight hours. I worked the midnight shift normally starting at 10:00 PM and finishing around 03:00 AM, allowing me all day and afternoon to myself before work. The pay is good for the hours worked. Benefit of more pay more hours. Overall, easy to get the work done and paid."
good,"I was only there for like 3 days as a seasonal worker i shouldn't even have to review this place."
good,The typical day was fast paced most of the time. We were given compensation for great work done. If we knew that there were issues that could not be resolved they were escalated to a higher level.
good,"- Management was good, they would come help out in the warehouse if needed."
good,You learn a lot about shipping and how to ship specific items.  Training was great.  It is relaxed and a fun environment to work for.  The pay was just not that great.
good,A normal day starts early. I'm up around 3 am so i can be at work by 4:15 am. Get everything set up and ready so the sort can start at 4:40 am on the dot. The sort then runs and all pacages are processed by 9:00 am so the drivers can leave by 9:10 am.
good,"A typical day of work is following the driver's instruction of simply scanning a package and dropping it off at the designated house. The description of the job sounds easy enough, but the environment can be faced paced with rough terrain which increases the likelihood of injury. With all that said it is rewarding at the end of the day given the sense of accomplishment you get from this somewhat rough work and the nice people you may meet."
good,"My typical day in the warehouse is preparation and self-efficiciency. All the employees meet inside the warehouse at 6:00 p.m. to discuss the guidelines on what task to complete. We take the first 5 minutes to exercise, then discuss the task that is expected each and everyday. Then, we head over to work stations to complete all task giving by our supervisor. Drinking constant water and staying alert helps keeps your body functional throughout the day. The hardest part of the job is not giving your full commitment and lack of production. The most enjoyable part of the job is showing enthusiasm in consistency inside the workforce. I strive to be a team player to help inspire other employees to be productive and self efficient."
good,Multiple shifts are available and the benefits are worth it. Time off is never a problem but is not paid time off. Managers put workers in a position to succeed.
good,well I start at 10pm to 3 I come in though the guard shack walk in the building clock in stretch my arms/legs/back then start work its a fast pace work area
good,the job itself is great. get to driver around delivering packages and have fun. fairly self explanatory. if youre an outdorsy person then its perfect for you.
good,"Very faced paced, lots of heavy lifting and unload and loading trailers.I would highly recomend anyone to work there. The supervisor is very demanding."
good,Great work area only problem I had was the hours I wasn’t getting enough to support my family so I had to unfortunately leave UPS to find a better a job . I’d still be working there but sadly I had to leave early because daughter was born . Great place good pay & a decent atmosphere.. would recommend to a friend for sure
good,Good place to work for students with flexible hours and ability to make additional pay when school is out. Always ability to work additional hours or fewer if needed with great benefits for part time employees.
good,You never know what the day may bring.  I've met some great people from around the world shipping some pretty amazing things from fine collections to items with sentimental values that could never replace them.  We work hard but have fun doing it.  A good place to work.
good,hours are tough. typical 3am to 9am but if you area collage student its a great place to get your feet wet in general management. A good boss makes all the difference.
good,While in retrospect 10.50/hr isnt much for roughing it in the frigid weather I got a long very well with my driver and kept moving so the hours passed by very quickly once I got used to my route. I highly recommend it especially if you want a sense of accomplishment because there is no more satisfying tired feeling than knowing you are tired from a long day of real work!
good,"Good benefits, many opportunities for career development (promotions, etc)  Flexible (to an extent) with regard to vacations/days off . Pay is adequate, hours can be llong sometimes, especially during peak periods (November/December)."
good,"To make any money, you have to own at least 5 stores.  The average stores has to do "
good,The environment was ok but the working conditions were somewhat bad. Learned that ups is a well organized company and they care about people..and their packages.
good,"Normas de seguridad, limpieza de sectores, lugar de trabajo agradable, capacitación."
good,UPS was a good place to work.  I worked the overnight hours which was wasn't easy.  A hard schedule to get used to.  I left for a different daytime job.
good,Ups is a place that keep going no slow pace everything is fast speed you have to be willing to take control of everything. you also has to have the physical abiliy to work.
good,A lot was expected every day but the pay and benefits were very good. I liked the routine of the work day and the fact that as long as the job got done the management team stayed out of the picture.
good,"A lot of walking involved. I went from house to house walking packages up to doorsteps in Pepper Pike, Oh mainly, and those were long driveways. Many times, after a long walk back to the truck, you get back inside, buckle up and pull off, your next stop is the next house down-where you do it all over again."
good,"Personal Vehicle drivers are well compensated.  They are connected to the team they are supplementing.  They are helped when necessary, but are also asked to help when they can do so.  This program was new for this area and season and needs a little polishing on orientation and communication."
good,"Great place to work at if you're looking for a first job, or just want to work somewhere for a very short amount of time."
good,I worked at a UPS Store that was located inside a hotel near a convention center area.  The environment was fast paced.  It was a good company to work for but they could certainly improve on providing competitive wages and benefits to their employees (equal pay for equal work).
good,Great fast-paced places to work. Lots of friendly people willing to help . Some managers are also very nice and helpful . What I really like about it is that I was able to make bonuses every week if I come on time everyday .
good,It is a fast paced job that you are only as good as the last truck you unload. If you aren't fast enough then you get treated like you don't do a good job even if it is not your fault.
good,Great learning experience anything you learned you can most definitely take it with you to better you in other work fields .Job was very fast last and hands on.
good,Working with UPS was fun and fast paced. The people I met were extremely friendly and welcoming. I felt like I was surrounded by close friends. Amazing company and workers!
good,Was a great experience! Loved helping employees and hiring new people into the company. Feedback was amazing and very helpful to continue providing support.
good,"A typical day I would wait to be called in to meet the driver somewhere along the route to clock on and deliver/pickup packages. Assisting the driver and splitting up to make deliveries seperately."
good,Everyone starts as a pilot. Take it from here and pile it there. Quick paced and management knows most will not last. It you can make the first year it pays great with benafits.
good,very fun to place to work at if you are looking for a part time job while also wanting exercise. the driver I was assigned to was a very good person to work with also.
good,"The job at ups helped me learn to overcome different obstacles and challenge myself too another level, I learned also too work as a team too get the job done unloading trucks."
good,Working at UPS is all about fast team work. We worked together to keep packages organizing and flowing accordingly. I learned how to operate different conveyor belts and process packages and shipping information. The hardest part was lifting 30 pound boxes and standing long hours but i loved my flexible schedules and coworkers.
good,"I worked as a package car delivery driver for the holiday's.  The pre-training is probably the most stressful thing that I have ever done, but once through that, the job is excellent if you're willing to work hard.  One of those companies that you wish you put in time for at a young age and stuck with like so many have."
good,"The workplace culture throughout the company at UPS is not very good. Many people in their offices are negative, lazy and unwilling to put in more work to get the job done."
good,its an okay job to have for driver helper position but its horrible to be a package handler they dont pay enough they treat their employees like dirt.
good,The positioni was temporary just to help with package delivery at the holiday season.  This temporary position only lasted two weeks and there were no more openings after the term ended.
good,"I was there temporarily for school payments. The benefits there are amazing but the work is hard and it doesn't pay much. If you are looking for a part time job with great benefits, this is the place for you."
good,it wasn't bad. just hard at time but it was a pretty good job so far.you have to off load the truck. then after you off load the truck you have to put the item
good,"You can make over 100k a year without a high school diploma at ups. You do have to start somewhere, and the hours suck, but it can pay off. I mostly left because of the 1:45am to 10:00am work day, six days a week."
good,"People were always complaining, but found out later that UPS was actually not a terrible job, it just was limited. If you were a people person, working in the warehouse, it was not the job for you. They wanted production, period."
good,"Very nice place to work just have to be careful whom you work with, very high paced place to work but it will give you a workout while you work there, very nice trainers and HR people."
good,"the work here is hard, but it's fun like you're working out. the pay is low, but the benefits are great and you get overtime after 4 hours. It's unionized, so there's no need to worry about getting fired unless you were dishonest, stole, or got physical with others. I recommend this job, especially as a first job or as extra income. Also the pay increases every 6 months."
good,Ups is a very good job for beginners willing to work in a warehouse setting. They dont require you to have much experiance because the training is very good and infomative.
good,"The drivers are very kind and very relatable upbeat and fast paced job not very many benefits but then again Iam only a seasonal helper, so I'm sure once you move up in the company"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at UPS. The package delivery job is not for everyone though because it is faced paced, long hours, repeative, and can be quite stressful. If I would have had the opportunity to stay on full time as a package driver I would have because the pay and benefits are awesome."
good,"A typical day for a loader is clocking in, grabbing a scanner, getting assigned to a truck or as a sweeper(cleaner) and scan packages making sure they go into the truck. "
good,"The company is the very best I've experienced in terms of promotion from within.  UPS almost always looks first to its employees to fill vacancies or new positions before going outside.  This builds loyalty and gives employees a sense of belonging to a very large, but supportive family.  Management styles are not cutting edge, but generally effective and usually fair, and demand a high level of commitment and effort.  Overall, I would recommend the company, especially to someone who wants to stay and grow with one organization over his/her career."
good,My UPS job was temporary. I was only their for a month. I can say that the job is not for everyone. Physical strength is needed to work in a warehouse owned by the UPS.
good,I like my current job.  The only problem is it is from 5 to 11pm.  There is room for advancement but if you are full time you are going to be working 60 hours a week.
good,I worked mostly as a driver helper. This position required driving with the driver and dropping off parcels at certain times. It was physical and required detail so as not to mix up deliveries. Packages also had to be delivered by a certain time frames.
good,Working at UPS was a great learning exprerience.  I learned how to become a manager of personnel and excellent time management.  The working environment was too stressful.
good,"quick paced environment"
good,"outside sales "
good,A place to earn extra cash and continue to work your day job. Not difficult and pretty well managed. A secure job with several career opportunities. Good luck.
good,UPS is a good job to start off with not really much in career advancement but the pay is OK and the hours are good.  You learn a lot about customer service and had a pack and ship packages
good,"UPS is a great place to work as a student and for some one seeking a long term investment or second job. Everybody I have worked with has been polite and treats other with respect, it is fast pace and physical but nonetheless a great job"
good,"He estado trabajando 4 meses y los compañeros y jefe son muy agradables, me encantaba el trabajo de conductor."
good,Never had any issues about doing my job safety is a priority be on time and be prepared do your job and stay out of trouble not everybody is happy you have the troublemakers and you have The Co-operators
good,"Being a helper, delivery packages to smiling customers. That's what made the job exciting. During the fall and winter seasons but typically stayed warm and busy."
good,"I took this job after having been laid off from a previous company. It was common knowledge that, I would not be working at this company forever. Regardless of this knowledge, I was still given good hours and the team and management had a good positive attitude toward me."
good,"They have great managers and supervisors. However, depending on the building, you may or may not fit in. The only way to advance is through management. If you don't want management, then you are really, really stuck."
good,My times as a seasonal driver helper for UPS was fun. I liked riding around in the truck and being outside. It is very fast paced and can be stressful trying to get heavy packages to the customers doors.
good,"Chek-in chek-out,reception de marchandise. "
good,Great place to work! I would definitely refer this place to a freind! the nights were late but I had good hours. I would definitely go back and work at ups.
good,Fast-passed and a chaotic at times.  Rewarding if you go through the management program.  They will provide tuition reimbursement and encourage continuing education.
good,you must be in shape & have a strong back. when you walk from the belt to the truck every package you must take a deep step. you will get use to it. many ppl have been there  for years though so i cant be that bad
good,Great place to work great work like balance always fast pace great pay great job for people looking for their first job great benefits easy location to travel to via car or public transportation.
good,cool place to work. you get work by email you know what you have to do you don't need anyone to tell you what to do each day you get your own clients and try to work on your own and be productive.
good,Started out part time morning sort worker advanced to part time supervisor within a year. Very fast paced. Great benefits. Working as a part time supervisor was more like full time. Would have stayed but they were shutting down center.
good,"The typical work days were good and the only reason it was tough was because things moved fast, but that's because it was the holidays. The only complaint is that when it rained the workers in the back had acquitted coverage."
good,everyone was great there with big smiles and kind words the work is what they say it is hard and demanding if you have never done something of that nature before but good overall just pay isn't enough for a man with a family
good,"easy to access the building with work ID"
good,"learn to work with others ,and help others so they can learn the job too working at ups keep you active ,thmost enjoyable part of the job is to finsih"
good,"UPS is a dynamic company that has been around for 110 year. The workplace culture is one of professionalism and one that believes in supporting our communities. The most enjoyable part of our job is having a relaxed atmosphere, the cohesiveness of teams and leaders and the many company perks offered. The hardest part would be finding something to complain about."
good,I would recommend others to go work for UPS cause its a fast pace job an if you like lifting boxes an working out then UPS is the job for you. The supervisors their are helpful an will talk things with you step by step
good,This is a good job to work. If you stuck it out the benefits are worth it.  This is a non stop 4 hours worked on your feet. It is a very physical job. It paid for me to finish school.
good,"Learned a lot about the shipping / parcel industry, and the proper techniques of packing various size boxes in a hurry. Management was caring and always gave a hand when needed."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Competitive benefits but they lack on competitive compensation. Strong company culture, but they lack the things that attract and retain younger employees. Management invests a lot in employee development and sales training."
good,"Fast paced"
good,Hard work just can handle working night shift being a mom. The hours pretty good. You can get just about as many hours as you want. Good pay and great staff for the most part. But is full of young college kids 17 and 20 year olds.
good,Fast paced work environment. Difficult to advance to full time status.  Seeking full time employment. Benefits are good. Management staff works with the resources available.
good,"Betaald goed, geen dag is het zelfde, gezellige en leuke collega's"
good,"The company is a very fast pace environment, The company is constantly growing so things are continuing to change in a positive way. The location is very large so there are many people and personalities in most work areas."
good,"Always something to do if you like graveyard shift very fast pace"
good,"Good aviation career. Earlier age one can get hired, the better. Stable. More pilots needed. Good work schedule and fly great equipment. Steady schedules due to high volume. Overtime possible."
good,I loved working as a bagger at the UPS hub.  I started off as a bagger and quickly went on to be a sorter.  This is a great job for full time students.
good,"My typical day was  entering international shipments to be exported to different countries, answering dispatch calls and running reweigh reports for management."
good,"I really enjoyed it, got quite stressful during the Xmas season but overall it really was awesome. Just keep moving and learning the fast ways to get the job done right"
good,"Management tells you time and time again to work safe. When the work area is not safe, they get upset when you aren't working fast enough. Packages are thrown and stepped on. It's seems that the only goal is to get packages loaded as fast as possible, no matter what happens to the employee or the packages."
good,It was an amazing place to work. The people were so friendly. The atmostphere is quick paced. Management was understanding. I recommend them to anyone who needs a job.
good,enjoyed working at UPS i had to move back to be closer to our families. I would of liked better pay but the benefits were good. the hours were not the best working 2nd shift.
good,"Fast paste, traveling interactions with customers. how too track packages, scanning packages,how to find diffenert routes to locations, friendly management"
good,Good work environment. Always enjoyed my work days. Good work out. Friendly staff & fair management. Healthy work environment. Only concern is all employees are part timers minus the drivers so a second job is a must.
good,Work fast paced early in the morning with a good schedule good work ethics are needed to succeed in this area otherwise the work load will overtake you.
good,Excellent company to began a career with lots of benefits and opportunities for advancements. I would have never left the company if I had any control over my circumstances. Looking forward to returning if at all possible.
good,"Ups helps pay for school, which is why I chose to work there. I became a supervisor after 6 months and have been a supervisor now for 3 years. I will graduate with no debt due to the tuition assistance."
good,Great place to work if you are interested in advancement in Operations Management. Coming in early morning for the Preload effected my work life balance.
good,"I liked working as an admin at UPS but it could be fast paced and stressful. There are lots of great people to meet. As an admin, you have a set time to come in each morning but there is no way to know what time you will get off. Hours are part time, I typically got between 25 and 30 as an admin."
good,great place to work in you do full time they offer great benefits from what i heard. i loved working for them and being responsible for delivering valuable assets to families across the state
good,"They have multiple shifts which is cool because it's easy to find a schedule that balances against my schooling. The supervisors are welcoming, and let you know they appreciate your work. People at cool there."
good,"ups was very stressful . i would go in around 9pm , but they would end the shift depending o the load we had . i would get 5000 packages done and thrown onto the belt . But i would not get paid what i deserved for the sweating and dripping that the job would cause me . i would work 6 days out the week but not many hours on some weeks , but others i would work full time . They would take money out our checks ."
good,I gained a lot of knowledge on shipping and receiving. Also worked on corporate portfolios. I also moved up to management so I gained a lot of experience.
good,it can be a fast pace job and stressful at time. I suggest dress accordingly to the seasons. Be prepare to work nonstop but will keep you in shape.Also stay hydrated while working in humid conditions.
good,Progression takes to long and not enough full time positions with company.  Turnover with company is extreme.  Turnover with management is also high.  Union positions so benifits make the job worth it for me.
good,"Not for the weak, job is demanding physically, and mentally, takes a toll on your body. The pay is more than average jobs but the hours are long. Vacations increases every 5 years, paid sick days and personal days."
good,Ups was a very fast paced company to work for. The drivers managers and general co workers were all pleasant to work with.Overall a great place to work at.
good,had an amazing time at UPS.  started as a loader then got promoted to supervisor and then moved to a package car driver which i loved. there's always a place for advancement which made it a great place to work.
good,"Fast-paced business servicing business and residential customers around the globe.  Our employees are known for being some of the hardest workers in the business world, and the manager's job is to keep them safe, efficient, and focused on service.  You are required to do this with a minimum of management staffing, relying on part-time supervisors to run many parts of the operation.  UPS is a union company (all hourly employees are Teamsters except a few administrative) and managers must know and understand the contract and manage within those guidelines.  Our business is measured in minutes and seconds 24 hours a day."
good,"Its what you would expect out a establishment like this, payment was alright but the hours were not so great. If you need a part time job its recommended and can also pursue the career to be a driver"
good,"A typical day at work was filling out drivers paperwork, scanning their logs in and a lot of data entry. I handed out placards for all Hazmat loads and assisted the Terminal Manager. I learned how important it is to pay attention to the details and product on the trucks to ensure they had the correct placards. I learned routing of trucks when weather called for them to be re-routed. The workplace culture is awesome for the most part. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and most management. We had a lot of fun as well as worked hard."
good,A new experience. New people. Fair pay but good benefits. There are also female workers that do loading and unloading. What else can I say. You only live once right?
good,"Job security in a fast paced business. Must have good communication skills, ability to adapt to change and work under stressful conditions.  Not a lot of opportunity for advancement to full time."
good,"Family and supportive culture but antiquated in many ways. I was happy about the opportunities, but they are dictated by management and play favorites to a certain degree. The job can be exciting and extremely boring within the same week so managing your emotions and frustrations are a balance needed to previously have under control."
good,Hard physical work with stressful situations!Pay and benefits are excellent but you earn the benefits you receive!UPS has been good to me.It has provided a good stable income and helped put 2 children through college
good,I have especially enjoyed the past 12 years driving tractor trailers local and long-distance. My coworkers are very easy to get along with management is about the same.
good,"Working for UPS during the holiday season is extremely stressful, but if you can handle a fast paced environment then UPS might work out for you. During the 2 years that I worked as a driver helper during the holiday season I received great compensation and for the most part management was cool. Also you experience depends on who your driver is. I was lucky enough to get cool drivers both years so it made my time working with UPS manageable. It is a very stressful job and it is hard work, however if you can handle that then you might enjoy working here. Also the opportunity to move up after the holiday season is there as long as you do a good job."
good,"I am appreciative of all that I learned but I need more income."
good,I typical day at work for me was me working in the small sort. My position of work was rearrange boxes on the conveyer belt into mail sorts so they can be received.
good,"if you need a great workout and only want to work a few hours a day, this is for you.  Expect to pay your dues, it takes a long time to climb the seniority list to drive."
good,"friendly caring staff, fun work environment. Management is always checking up on their employees to make sure we are doing great. Being a sorter for me was a very physical job and I was injured several times and that was because of the conveyor belt bars. I would still love to be a part of this company if it wasn't for a sick child at home."
good,Union workers get a good wage for the hours and labor. Management  tends to be on the underpaid side for the amount they expect you to do in one day. Numerous opportunities for advancement and self education
good,"Employee compensation was adequate for effort given; hours were not favorable for a family; work ethic was strong; work relationship between union employees and management employees was strenuous."
good,Warehouse environment.  Fast paced.  Constant interaction with various departments.  Good employer for advancement.  At times difficult to work with Union.
good,"Great place to work. Coworkers are nuts but professional. You have to be a special kind of crazy to work there. It can be busy or boring, but you always have something to do. You will be well trained."
good,Managing union and non union employees. typically discussing methods and expectations ensuring the work is getting done satisfactory.  analyzing and planning the dispatch of drivers to ensure all customer freight is picked up at the appointment time.  Many great experiences at UPS with the challenges and the problem solving that happens day to day.  constantly looking at ways to improve efficiencies and communicating with the personnel.  Personnel have a positive attitude working together and keeping morale high.  overall a good place to work.
good,"During most of my time with UPS I felt like a vital part of a successful team. The last 2 years became more ""cut-throat"" as management was shifted and duties changed rapidly. Many jumped ship...I tried to ""stick it out"" but was eventually ""let go"" for what was considered waning performance, which seemed strange since I was promoted rapidly and well respected."
good,"Great job if you want to lose weight, good environment, must have a good eye to spot a box or bag in the wrong shipment area. Managers and supervisors work just has hard as everyone else."
good,"The UPS Store has a great work environment along with flexible hours and opportunities to advance. I learned how to process monthly reports and meet certain deadlines to prepare for each quarter. UPS is a fast pace environment with accessible assistance for management and corporate office. Although the work place environment is sociable and family oriented, the communication can be lacking between business owner and staff. The best part of the job was being able to meet and converse with our customers on a business and personal level to fulfill their needs."
good,Requires hard work but it is a good part time job to have when you need some money. Can provide a good pathway to a career if desired. The benefits are worth it when to stick it out with the company.
good,UPS is great place to work for college student and those looking for supplement income.  If you like part-time warehouse labor this is a great to gain a physical workout.
good,"The company established an excellent corporate culture of respect, innovation, and excellence. With the challenges of the millennial generation, some adjustments regarding advancement and compensation must be implemented to attract and retain new talent."
good,Put the correct load into the right truck as required. High demand  job very skillful position. Great work out part time. Management is equal a union based job.
good,I enjoyed working for UPS however after 12 years of experience in Leadership and I expressed an interest in broadening experience to warehouse they frowned on my abilities to be able to perform duties. However advancement in my current position did not allow further advancement
good,"UPS was a very challenging fast pace environment, Job duties included: making route deliveries on a timely fashion, being able to meet all deadlines that was required. Being organized and professional for all customers."
good,"UPS is a good job for people who are good at working.  Unfortunately there are just as many workers who are good at not doing anything, or even showing up.  The benefits are outstanding.  Expect overtime especially if you are a worker."
good,"The pay is excellent .health care is 100 % paid with 100 %coverage...with exception to eye and dental which is about 70%..coverage...pension is outstanding..full package with wages and benefits is worth 130,000 yearly..without a college education I am grateful for the standard of living UPS HAS AFFORDED ME AND MY FAMILY!...and with 27 years of service I now get 6 weeks vacation with 8 sick days..and 9 paid … "
good,"Its great to work here part time, great benefits and the people here are great to work with.  The only problem I had working here is it takes to long to be able to advance anywhere within the company."
good,"UPSers are very hardworking, doing whatever it takes to get the job and service the customer. Outstanding job advancement opportunities for everyone that wants to put the work in. Work-life balance for full-time management is the only con."
good,I worked part time and had to work very early in the morning.  The people that I worked with were very friendly and I enjoyed the work atmosphere.  Relocation was a concern for going to full time.
good,"A day at work can be very relaxing, depending on if the building reaches staffing, belts can keep up with the high flow/volume, and our communication is on point. There are many days where it's strenuous, when i as a supervisor have to work like an hourly, and still find the time to get paper work done, run my area, and play my part in making sure the sort operation goes down in time, along with the weather conditions in a warehouse. What i love most about the job is pretty much everyday learning something new when it comes to dealing with different types of egos & personalities, balancing them all, and staying in a positive mindset & staying in the leadership role when things don't go my way. As well as, having to adapt & take on the challenges that come throughout the day, being able to think on my feet & make it happen!"
good,Excellent job security and benefits.  I learned a lot about the logistics field and business.  I was given a lot of responsibilities that developed my business aptitude and situational awareness.
good,"I loved working at UPS. There were ups and downs, but ultimately everyday was different and I loved the team mentality that occurred daily.  It's also a great physical work out."
good,UPS had really good benefits. It was really hot inside the warehouse though. It was tough labor. No a/c in the warehouse. It was a great work out at the same time because of all of the labor. Overall UPS was a great experience i had.
good,"Great company to work for. Compensation is excellent"
good,"It was a nice job, but the management job was very stressful. At the age of 19 I was able to solve all long time employee disputes, and raise our team efficiency rating from 78 to 110 points. Even tho I was able to do these great things, there was always an issue with upper management. Management did not seem to be flexible on even the smallest issue, even though I did not allow my transportation issues to interfere with my work. A lot of the employees I trained, still work there, but I had to resign because of the disrespectful interactions and harassment from my regional manager."
good,good place to work with great benefits and pay rate with only down side of not having a sit schedule and days off. one not very good thing which is not being respected by the customer where the driver delivers.
good,this job can be pretty demanding but it is good pay and benefits. Only part time in the warehouse. i personally work on unloading trucks. typical day for me is i get in my truck and unload everything as fast as i can as safe as i can. it can be hot and very fast past.
good,"Fun place to work,and you meet a lot of new people everyday,great learning experience for young workers,a lot of different positions to work within the job."
good,"This was a great place to work, and we accomplished quite a bit during my time there. This store has a great atmosphere, and I miss many of the regular customers and the challenges they brought us."
good,"It was a good job for a teenager, or a second job. There was not alot of hours per shift. However that led to flexibility for other life activities or dealings."
good,Helped to deliver packages and manage time along with helping the driver with organizing packages for the next stop. The job is simple enough and easy when things start to speed along
good,A typical day working at ups was uplifting in which I found very comfort way to work.manegers are kind and careful.ive learned the most important thing you can learn which is safety.the work place culture is based off safety.the hardest part was getting layed off. What I most enjoyed about the job is the the way it made me feel made me want to work harder
good,"If you do not like to work this is not the job for you. It is a face paced working environment, that at times requires quick thinking and flexibility, as well as physicality."
good,good place to work but may need another job if your not a full-time worker.. wanted to stay after holiday but there was no room for me. Called back a few mths after for a job but never heard from them again
good,A typical day consisted of myself and the driver properly organizing our truck then we would start our day delivering our packages. We had a regular route so you see similar faces for the most part and everyone is friendly. We walk many miles and lift many packages on a daily basis which can sometimes be difficult but the relationship you build with the community makes it worth it. We also had to pickup commercial packages to take back to our grounds.
good,"I have learned a lot at UPS. There is a lot of opportunity for growth, but it is hard to find a full-time position......................................."
good,Great company to work for if you like manual labor and a night shift.  Can be very demanding on your body but can be very fun if you make it that way.  Very easy to move up in the ranks if you work hard and stay on top of management about it.  A lot of old heads that will be retiring soon.
good,very challenging task to take on. Everything pretty smooth far as package handling but can really get tough unloading and loading trucks back to back. things can get overwhelm but stay focus and get the job done.
good,"Great company to work with if you come to work daily and come home, you have to remember that not many people are going to share your work ethic or beliefs."
good,"Es buena empresa ,lo único es que le falta que su personal sea mas comprometido"
good,the hours suck but you get use the them. the money and the benefits are really good. as long as you work hard and show up for work its hard to get fired.
good,Managing staff at the small sort department by helping my Full time Supervisor get the job done . I learned some other techniques of man management which helps me in the future when in management.
good,"UPS was basically a seasonal job because I was still in school at the time. The benefits were ok its jus the hours I felt was long enough. Never really had a job where I work just 4 hours. That was different for me the supervisors at the time was young jus like me so it wasn't really any discipline or authority or what not. It was nothing really that I can say that was enjoyable about this job, just my opinion."
good,"Very peaceful and efficient. Fast paced work seems to flow by with the forest nearby."
good,"Help deliver packages at a quick pace. Assist with heavy packages that need more then one person to carry. Ensure packages are delivered properly and safely. Later in the day, organize what is left and check to see if any missing packages earlier are there or not (some packages that come in around this time of year are scanned but not placed in the van due to not enough room, so some get left behind and are delivered the next day, and if they were in the vehicle make sure they get delivered)."
good,Benefits are great. People are good.  Hours are okay. Just like any other good job. You have your good days and you have your bad. Been there almost a year and I like it. The work is good.
good,My job at United Parcel Service was a very taxing experience for me. I would never recommend this job for anyone that cannot physically deliver in a manual labor job.
good,"Overall company is above standards with wages and benefits, UPS is a fortune 500 company one of the best places to work in the world! Reno Sparks Local management and union need improvements."
good,Benifits were good very hard work management was bad advancement opportunities are slim money was decent.I would not recommend this job to anyone with any physical issues
good,Working at UPS is not for people who can't handle factory work. The building is the same temperate as it is outside. The pay is good and they have good benefits if you take advantage of them.
good,"This is a great company to work the warehouse set up is overall a little disorganized but other than that it's a easy Quick money job .with great insurance an they also pay 3,000 a semester for your college the benefits are great."
good,UPS is great for your first job while going to school. They will work with you when needed and when they are able to do so. Management tends to have fun while keeping the work flowing.
good,Typically I would walk into a mess and spend the next several hours organizing it for my employees. It was the first time I had ever worked in a union environment.
good,go to different areas drop off packages to business residential area pick up packages from business get package ready to be dropped off.sorts mail that's going out for that day
good,"United Parcel service is a very good employer for all whom are well suited to perform the duties and manage the responsibilities at the job. Would recommend to any who are physically, emotionally, and mentally qualified to handle the arduous task of lifting & lowering heavy items, moving at a speed which one might be comfortable with; and, if promoted: managing employees."
good,It was a learning experience in the shipping and receiving departments. It helped in the improvement of customer dealings and team playing. It was the most enjoyable job i had until now.
good,I liked working at UPS. They have great benefits and the Union is great also. It was a fast pace environment but I was really able to handle it. I would advise anyone to work here.
good,"Typically I would clock in, and get straight to work. And in between loading trucks and opening cargo bags I would mingle with some coworkers but there were a few guys that were really cliquey and almost made me feel left out."
good,Ups is a very fast pace working job and requires physical work. (Lifting heavy packages and moving at a brisk pace to get all your deliveries on time.
good,"Worked for UPS over 20 years, mostly in management.  Enjoyed the flexible work hours and the benefits, as well as the overall culture of Integrity and Honesty.  I would recommend working for them to anyone interested"
good,"Loved working as a drivers helper, especially during the holiday time and getting to deliver packages that were gifts. I had a great experience and I will definitely be willing to do it again."
good,"Drive and deliver at a fast pace. NO HOME Life."
good,no matter the condition our number two mission is to satisfy our customers.  Our first mission is to move freight safely.  The worst thing about this job is that union protects people who sometimes don't deserve their jobs.
good,This job would be bettet for me if the shift times were better. For example my shift is from 4 am to 9 am. This has messed up my sleeping schedule and makes it hard to commute due to the late night hours.
good,when holidays come around there is practically endless amounts of hours available to be worked. They offer a bonus for the seasonal workers and for the permanent works benefits are offered a year after employment. Not bad at all
good,"It is a fast paced work area. I cover from loading the package cars, unloading the semi trailers, to clerk and scanner, where I deal with customers and fix addresses or messed up boxes."
good,I didn't like they pay because of how much I worked just to receive a small amount but overall the people were friendly just needs better management. I would work at ups again just not that exact one because of they're not well with managing or organizing
good,"High volume, highly objective oriented company. Compensation and benefits are favorable to employees. Exceptionally customer service oriented. Must meet daily, weekly, monthly measurements."
good,wish promotions happened quicker for employees with  CDLs. you spend at least two to three years just trying to get your foot in the door since you have to drive the straight trucks first.
good,"I have gained a lot of knowledge as a UPSER that i will be able to apply throughout my career. The culture is what makes UPS a great company, you will always have someone to reach out to for support."
good,"Mann kommt jeden tag 1 std früher als mann bezahlt wird.Wenn mann pech hat wird mann in gebiet geschickt das mann garnicht kennt.Wird hin und her geschäucht."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. Pretty good benefits. Good work environment,, Generally encourage learning, movement and growth. People keep their jobs here a long time, not a ton of turnover."
good,The store I worked in has been sold at least once so I am not sure who is the current owner. It can be a very difficult place to work especially during peak shipping seasons like the holidays.
good,"Great workplace with options to grow or venture to others fields."
good,"Working at UPS is physically and mentally challenging. The pace is quick, the demands are high and the conditions are rough. However, if you survive the first six weeks it can actually be quite enjoyable and if you stick around there are regular raises and incredible benefits."
good,"Personally, I like working for a company where everyone is bought into the same purpose and goal, ie. servicing the customer, saving the environment, providing the best product, etc, and I expected something similar when I first came to UPS. However, I quickly came to realize that at UPS, no one seems to care to be there and people care nothing of what UPS is trying to do as a company. I just didn't like the attitude communicated by the staff."
good,The work shift starts around 9pm at philippines to cope up with the schedule or time at USA. The work is to ensure the smooth delivery and pickups of all freight services.
good,"Good place to start a career, get reimbursed for college tuition, fast paced, safety is always stressed, great co-workers and supervisors, minimum skills needed to work there."
good,"I typically worked about 5 hours a night sorting and loading packages. It was very tiring, but the work went by quickly."
good,Job comes with Great benefits. Friendly employees and work environment. Pay rate does not match work requirements. Hours given to work are not enough.
good,you work hard but its very rewarding. benefit package is beyond anything offered in any other job. advancement past a certain point is slow but very possible.
good,Management could be a whole lot better in my opinion nothing's ever set and stone they always require last minute changes to your day. They ask the most of a worker while giving back little to nothing for a worker compensating to benefit company needs I onced had training for 16 hours with guaranteed overtime pay but only received half the over time pay. I work the customer counter (cc) and help after with local sort if our air driver has to run a route due to lack of drivers I am required to perform both jobs with very little to no help when it's a two man job to be finished at our required feeder pull time
good,"Highly structured, and fellow employees rely on each other to get the job done. The employees that do the work do not believe in doing work without being told to do something, mostly lazy."
good,"-Independent though out the day to complete deliveries on the route."
good,"TRavail intense, beaucoup de livraison et peu de temps pour le seffectués"
good,"UPS is a great company, everyday there is work. It gets tough but I work through it everyday no matter the circumstance, or who is manager on duty. I have many skills UPS has taught me. I have the ability to sort 711 packages per hour, Unload a 53 Foot Long truck in 45 minutes, work under pressure, act as Supervisor if Supervisor is absent."
good,United Parcel Service company is biggest courier company in the world.The employee satisfaction will be really high here. And they are providing several inbox training on several subjects.They got professional people to organize these training. UPS gives value for Health safety of employee. I worked here in different roles. I started here as courier then promoted as Operations Trainer and left the company when i was health and safety specialist.
good,Really great entry level job. The go to associate to provide customer service. Great training in small company experience. On the job training is best in learning the ins and outs of industry.
good,You can literally work as much as you want. I was working from 65 to 70 hours per week and it paid off in the end. Make sure you wear a back brace and always bend at the knees when lifting.
good,There was always something to learn everyday. Great work place fun and productive environment. Great pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant movement of the boxes because it made time fly by.
good,I have learned a lot from UPS. It was a great place to get started and gain a lot knowledge from learning how shipping and receiving packages is done.
good,"The UPS store builds productivity traits, employees will learn to multitask and type with speed and efficiency due to the amount of shipments being processed on a daily basis."
good,It's great to have a job that allows you to be off on weekends and holidays. Overtime pays time and half after working over 5 hours. They also pay for some school.
good,"I like my job because of"
good,"The pay for drivers was by far the best thing about this company. Great pay, can easily work atleast 40 hrs a week and can always volunteer to work Saturdays for time and a half. Sat deliveries are easy and are such gravy, work 4-5 hrs to make 10-50 deliveries depending on where your sat route will be."
good,Work nights and get paid for it .Great job. Drop and hook. If you like micro managed jobs this is for you. Not to bad as long as you do your job. My manager was very good.
good,"This job is good if you are going to school. but to actually have it to pay for real life bills it isn't that well. hours are consistent as well as days. also their benefits beat every pastime out there plus paid weeks, holidays and more."
good,I think UPS is a great job to apply for and great company to overall work for. The work is sometimes demanding also the hours can be a little difficult to adapt to but once you put your time into the company the benefits and compensation is terrific for a part time job.
good,"I enjoy working at UPS. My position is a supervisory position as Helper Coordinator. I recruit Helpers to go out on routes with drivers to assist in delivering packages during their peak season."
good,They have a good set up if you what to move up in the company and or help you get to where you wanna go if you don't want to. A great experience for anyone.
good,"Los franquiciantes son personas de buen corazon, honestas y muy humildes. Te tratan como familia y son dedicados a sus trabajadores y clientes por igual"
good,"Its hard to move up"
good,"Working the night shift part time whilst i recover from the illness i suffered from, in this job my tasks are to load the UPS vehicles from a belt sorting postcodes into the correct vans in a timeley and correct manor. This job is part time whilst i look for my next career move in the catering industry."
good,This business is ran very efficiently. Such a fast paste job but management made it as fun and as easy as possible. My favorite part of this job was the wotk out like routine that came with the job. It allowed the day to go by alot faster
good,muy buen ambiente de trabajo buena comunicación con los colegas
good,"Very rewarding job if your willing to put the time and effort in.  You will work for what you earn.  "
good,"UPS has a very great work environment.  It is a safe and productive place to work at.  The training received could have been better however, the job is not difficult."
good,"You will be working very hard. It may be boring or tedious but just stay busy."
good,Hard work to short of brakes. Brakes are only 10 minutes. the equipment needed to be updated. But it is good place to grow and get far in company hard work
good,"This job is hard working and very tiring at some points. Overall is so worth it. The pay and benefits are great. If you're looking for a seasonal job and some extra Christmas money, this is the job for you. I myself personally will work for UPS every season if I don't have a job during the time of."
good,What you'd expect at a package handling facility during Christmas time. Hard and fast pace. Supervisors were the right amount of tough and that should be necessary.
good,I only worked with UPS seasonally for the holidays. The pay was good and it kept me busy. You learn skills like data entry and customer service.
good,"The Seasonal Drivers are given a week's paid training and then work with their local center's supervisor or another experienced driver to learn the ropes. After that they share some of the overall load of the peak season by picking up parts or all of some of the regular routes."
good,"Sorted, loaded, and unloaded packages in the ground facility and the air freight facility.  Not much to elaborate on moving a package from point A to point B, except UPS does it well.   Credit goes to he management team as they all started at the bottom, so they know what it takes to perform their jobs that is satisfactory to their customers."
good,UPS is an excellent employer. Plenty of room for advancement and other opportunities. UPS has a long solid history. Needless to say there are those who do spoil the taste (management).
good,"A typical day at work as an unloader would be show up and unload tractor trailer trunks as fast as you can. Management is okay, just like any job you will have great/horrible bosses. I enjoy my job though for the most part and plan to retire from there."
good,"It was a fun job, you deliver packages around your area code zone. Its a fast past work, and your always on the move from jumping out of the truck to running to someones door to deliver a package. the onlything i didnt luike was you have to wait till they terminate you to aplly to nother job through ups such as warehouse position. They take up to 2 months after you return there uniform to say you dont work for them anymore."
good,"It's hard work even as a seasonal employee. If you can work through rough weather conditions and follow instructions to be safe. Then this company treats you fairly. "
good,"It was fun I want to go back next peak, only for seasonal but it was hard work with a fast paced job. The supervisors didn't know much including our names and I never did get an ID but co workers are great everyone's so nice."
good,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal driver. It was a great experience. You were always on he move, and other experienced drivers helped train well. There was never a dull moment."
good,Typical day involved delivering a full truck of packages to many locations and in return picking up packages and returning to warehouse.  I learned how to delegate work on a fast pace time scale.
good,"As an owner/operator your growth is dependent upon yourself. Personally I feel being a multiple owner of several centers is how you make decent money, but it is a lot of work."
good,"Fast paced, time goes by fast. As far as coworkers we all work together. The most enjoyable part of my job is filling my assigned truck up."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers. The day to day duties is not terribly bad, however, working for a small business has a downside. The advancement opportunities are limited, and there are no benefits offered. On the upside, working closely with a  small team of people builds strong relationships and some personal friendships that one will have for a lifetime."
good,i worked at ups for about a year it was a hard working job that was like working out in a gym you had to bend your back to pick up boxes and stock them the right way so boxes wont fall i had learned alot from this job as well as getting a stronger back
good,"UPS was overall a great place to work. My facility had a great management team and the crew was always good about coming together to get things done by the deadline. I would recommend this job for anyone looking for a part time job. There is a lot of heavy lifting (100+ lbs.), and we were constantly rushing to get the job done. Very high paced job"
good,"Typical day can be very busy as an operations supervisor.  Always something going on, very few moments of down time but normally good people to work with."
good,"A typical day at work consists of paperwork, dealing in employee relations, loading packages, assisting employees with any issues they may have, and overall safety of everybody. I have learned much better people skills through my work here. Having to deal with multiple different employees every night has improved my management skills and skills at talking to people overall. The management is very bottom line oriented, meaning they seem to care more about production and numbers than employee relations. However, I see this as an opportunity to try to strike my own personal balance between the two, being a member of management. The hardest part of my job is multi-tasking, having to deal with multiple trailers, employees, and issues all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is employee relations, keeping a good relationship with all of my employees and making sure they have someone comfortable to come and talk to with any issues they have. Also, maintaining a positive work environment for everyone."
good,It was a good company the pay was very steady and the hours varied I had family issues that was wat lead to my departure but I would work for them agaib
good,"I was a delivery driver for the commercial and industrial area"
good,I loved working for ups i was a healthier happier person i got paid great and i was never over worked because of the flexible hours the provided. and i have very mimimal contact with others which i like cuz i work best alone at my own pace
good,"strives on employee training and development, included its work force in its decisions as it impacted work performance and moral."
good,Receive orders from customers that need packages packed in a timely manner. Print flyers and other type of print. I learned to be a team member that could help us make money. since this was my first full time job it taught me how to have a good work ethic everyday coming to work. my co workers are great and so is management. The only problem is the wage is not good enough and I see no chances to advance in the business. I am also looking for more of a set schedule that will work for my college classes.
good,"It wasn't very consistent but it got my through the winter. The work was simple and fun, but a lot of things that were said at orientation didn't quite add up to what my group was actually offered when it came time to work."
good,"During peak season which is from October till mid January, it is very demanding during that time period and requires 60 plus hours a week. The company is closed all major holidays which the company is huge on. Yes the job is demanding but you learn a lot quickly. I had the experience of not being micromanaged. If you fail, management makes sure you understand what you wrong and give corrective action, which very important to address. I learned how to make quick decisions under pressure to the point that you took it as regular thing after awhile.The employees are a mixture of temps and company employees that are union and none union. It is overall a good employer. The only true issue I had it that it takes a lot to be promoted. The most difficult about the job is production is heavily overlooked which keeps you your toes. Production reports are do hourly."
good,"When having a group of educated people who know the in's and out of the logistics business helps your day be productive and knowing that your knowledge and ability  played an important part too. We were a group people and employees, friends and know each other children names,... we were family away from home, but work was always done in a timely manner with a smile at the end of the day!"
good,"Hard on the eyes reading so many labels. Cardboard boxes dry out your fingers.I taped crayons to my fingers for sort marking, special gloves for crayon holding and box handling grip would help all."
good,"I enjoyed working there at the UPS hub for what time I had there. the Management was decent, they rewarded us with food on jobs well done and certain Holidays. Also advancements to other positions will be available to you if you prove to your supervisor how much of a good worker you are"
good,"- Good process/procedure management"
good,"UPS is a great company to work for with many awesome benefits to help you advance in life and your career. They offer up to $5,000 a year for school with a total of $25,000 total."
good,"Es muy cómodo estar ahí, no hay presion y esta muy padre el ambiente laboral. Aprendi mucho en caja y en ventas."
good,Productive and fun work place to be in. It has a fair salary and with good benefits/incentives. The hard part of the job is when it is peak season because there are lots of boxes and are heavy. The enjoyable part of the job is having nice and friendly coworkers around.
good,Es una gran empresa ética honesta dedicada a cuidar y la satisfacción del cliente solo un poco conservadores pero excelente empresa para trabajar
good,"Very stable job, with room for advancement within the company"
good,"I manage 15 Customer Operations Specialists, each with a 'type A' personality which made coming into work everyday a challenge in a positive way. I learned to be a better manager to the people everyday."
good,The management and long time employees at UPS are all good people who look out for new hires and stress how important proper lifting mechanics are in order to prevent potential injury.
good,Did not pay enough for me to stay there! But was a good first job to have! I learned tons about customer service and also a lot about organization and shipping items across the world!
good,"UPS is a good place to work , they have a lot of good opportunities...Salary , the Union , Medicare , work time is perfect. They even pay for your school"
good,"At UPS I've taken the time learn just how important it is to always keep your work area clean and scan your where you walk. Working among the people I spend  my days with I have gotten a better relationship with them. I do feel like the hardest part of the job tends to be dealing with the heat at times, but thank god we have an AC down stairs. The fun part about the job is working with the machines I do and seeing how they work."
good,"Fast paste unloading, sorting and loading of the packages. Great group of people to work with. Good leadership. Heavy lifting at a fast pace. Getting the job done with a minimum amount of problems."
good,I loved my job.The customers were wonderful. I knew what was expected of me for the first few years I worked there. Different management came in and co-workers and I were not updated on new training. Employees are only as good as you train them.
good,"Love the people, the culture and the work. Ups offered you opportunity to advance in their company. We only work 3.50 or 5 hours and thats where i had a problem. Only in peak season u get hours. I love my boss and the people and it was a great opportunity"
good,Work days are tough but everything runs smooth. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting the boxes out of those packed cages. The most enjoyable part was watching the trucks leave and knowing you got the job done on time.
good,package handler that deals with handling packages.   handling packages can be tough when handling packages. it is important to handle packages while following certain package handling guidelines provided by the package handling guidebook.
good,"Great drivers, adequate salary. Meet with drivers and their trucks, and begin work dropping off packages to clients houses. Great experience overall."
good,I learned how to work on a conveyor line sorter assembly system. Being able to read the labels at a fast rate and sorting the packages. Also helping others to ensure the trucks could leave on time.
good,a typical day was always fast pace. sorting packages & loading trucks. I learned to pace myself & to stay focused while doing my job. Hardest part of the day was maintaining your pace. The most enjoyable part of the day was the end of the day.
good,"If you love hard intense laborious tasks on a daily basis, and no breaks. This is the job for you.However if you survive the intense labor the benefits are worth it. The pay is terrible considering the amount of work and the production status quo."
good,"I worked in UPS as account receivable assistant and also as Senior assistant in Billing . I learned logistics operations from start to end . I  learned advance excel ,macros. Management of UPS is very professional and skilled management.  Co workers are very supportive and helpful, Hardest part of job is night shift."
good,UPS is a fast pace job and you have to be at work 4:00 a.m. in the morning ready to work and I mean work. There's a lot lifting of heavy boxes and dangerous goods.
good,"It can be a very stressful job at times dealing with staffing, equipment breakdowns,  and being productive with a small time frame. i have been a supervisor for 4 years now so i have seen it all. Overall the company has been good to me so i can't complain"
good,"Its a fast pace work environment, you gotta work fast, and load faster. They want you to load, and maintain at the very least 350 pph. pph means packages per hour."
good,This was a good job for a teenager and I enjoyed helping our team succeed at getting packages to customers on time.  Working in the irregular department was challenging because of the heavy lifting involved.  I liked our team and would recommend working if you can handle the pace of always moving.
good,Not a bad place to work.  There are opportunities for advancement.  Management is ok.  The job culture is ok.  Just be prepared for extreme hot and cold temperatures.
good,Working At UPS Taught me How to Deal with different peoples attitudes how to carry a heavy work load. the Hardest Part about the job was handling tons of packages at a time but after while it became a natural. the Most enjoyable part was the Co workers they were amazing and helpful and interacting with different guest and getting to know them
good,"Well rounded and diverse company, friendly and trusted environment. UPS cores and values are unique and well respected."
good,"I was a sales asst coordinator when I was employed with UPS. Assisting UPS Account executives with their daily itineraries ad monitors their day to day sales. I was then promoted as Unit Head of  Tracking and Tracing. I had 3 staff working under me. My unit deals with proof of delivery inquiries, loss and damages of parcels. This is where I was trained to deal with customers around the world. "
good,Work 4-5 physical and hot hours a day. Practice safety habits and speed. Management isn't the best but they do work with you when they can. Co-workers are okay but it also seems like UPS just hires anyone they can so you run into a few unpleasant ones. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the heat. Most enjoyable part is starting off at a good pay.
good,The job is incredibly difficult and not the safest work environment. The wages are terrible to start but is balanced by excellent benefits. Upward mobility is extremely limited but if you put in the time (12+ years) then you will eventually make a nice wage.
good,"A hard job with great benefits for part timers.  You will work hard, but the health care and education assistance is great for young adults and college students."
good,"If  you are not ready for a rough start to your day, don't apply. It's hard work. The managers and supervisors can give you a lot grief over such a simple job. But, if you can have a tunnel vison frame of mind everyday, you can make it."
good,enjoyed my time at work and my manager. My coworkers were very helpful during my trainer and helped me learn the ropes of packing the trucks.
good,Hardest part of the job is when there are a ridiculous amount of packages coming down the belt and you have to keep up with it and work as fast as you can.  Most enjoyable part of the job is how easy it is to get along with people no matter age or gender which makes it easier to communicate and get the job done.
good,"Training is short but fulfilling. Management is understanding, customer service based sales. Must be able to pack a box according to standards taught, but easy when you get used to it."
good,Learned a lot about the shipping Industry. Very physically demanding on your body. Great employees and understanding Management. overall a great place to work.
good,"I only spent a few weeks with UPS only because it was holiday work as a helper, but it was good, hard work. I worked with three different drivers who were all friendly. You were constantly moving but this made the job only more interesting. I would like to some day get a job with UPS corporate."
good,"On a typical day at UPS, as a supervisor, I would make sure my work area was clean, check the trucks lined up to see if any of them needed adjustments, then have the employees assigned under me move around and load boxes throughout the trucks. then at the end of the day, we cleaned up for the next sort, and wrote our reports.  I learned a lot about how you should always keep tabs on the people working for you.  The management was great mainly because they knew what we were going through and helped out where they could. The other supervisors were great people and usually did their job, but you had to keep an eye on the employees to make sure they weren't taking advantage of the hourly pay by not doing anything.  The hardest part of the job was keeping all of your employees in line, and the most enjoyable part of the job was reading good reports on how your area did."
good,"Very good company lost of projects and opportunities."
good,"When i started off at Ups, it definitely took a little adjusting. I worked nights so my body had to physically and mentally adapt to that environment. It's a very fast paced environment, everything is done quickly and orderly. While I worked, I had many chances to socialize adding a few new friends into my life. Personally, Ups helped build my hand-eye coordination skills very fluently, as I progressed I became known as one of the most reliable loaders on my dock."
good,Come in and work as directed. Hard workers always moving to get the work out an on the road in a timigly fashion. hardest part is the mid day after break to push thru the day
good,"If you're young, focused on school then this is the job for you. Free schooling and amazing benefits but you can not survive on the pay and part time hours. It takes YEARS to move up to full time and in my case I could not wait that long to pay my bills."
good,fast pace keeps u on your toes would have liked more hours but over all was a great place to work. this was my first job I learned how to be a team player .
good,Loaded and unloaded trailers. Processed international packages. showed up early to set up the sort. Hardest part of the job was peak season.
good,"Being able to work outside, drive, and meet new people daily. Working Monday thru Friday. Great people to work with.The hardest part of the job would be the weather conditions."
good,"UPS employs some of the best in the industry to include management.  In general, the moral of the employees is very high and is a pleasure supervising this group."
good,There was always something to do to keep you busy. Co-workers as well as managers were very kind and helpful. A typical day at work consist of sorting and labeling packages for delivery.
good,"I only worked here seasonally, but it was a good experience and meet lots of nice people. The manager was very cooperative with my being a big man and so was the driver. If I needed a break due to shortness of breath, they obliged. Great pay and now I have a great reference."
good,local pickup and drop off of trailers ..outstanding logistics and work day was very busy and facilities were well run and effecient .Very hard to get into full time employment .
good,Great place to work but the hours are virtually non existent after the holidays. It's a fast paced job which makes the shift fly by.
good,"A great company to work for. Most days started with me meeting the driver at a pre-determined destination. We would sort out the parcels in the van and group everything into certain postal codes to ensure the fastest route possible. I felt that my time management and logistics skill have been improved during my employment with UPS. I was being kept up to date with my day to day working schedule via texts and phones calls with the management and with my driver. As I had been out of work for some time due to illness, I thought getting back in to a working routine would be a slight challenge but found it to be of no issue at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with the public and with local businesses on a daily bases."
good,I worked in the preload shift. I loaded and unload delivery trucks. I also fixed damaged boxes and made address corrections. I left UPS because I was laid off.
good,"This job has its good parts and bad parts, bad parts peak which start in November and end around mid January. If hired to work peak you might get to stay or you might be laid off like right after its over. The good part is the benefits and the pay, also most of the managers are nice and understanding. main problem is how hard you have to work for how much you get paid, hours aren't horrible if you don't have a life. Its a good job if you are willing to work with them and around their hours."
good,"This job has served me well over the years, but has limited advancement opportunity for me. As it is only part-time, I am to a point where I need a few years with a second employer in order to set myself up properly for my own future."
good,A physical job with great benefits. Not for you if you are unable to carry more than 40 lbs. The hours are set so it is very difficult to hit overtime.
good,"Great place to work, i Enjoyed every second of it and I would go back just to have their heath insurance again. only reason i don't is because i chose a new career path and that not it"
good,"I liked working there, it wasn't even bad at all. I'm no stranger to manual labor. So it wasn't as bad as people made it seem. They had great benefits. They helped with people in school. It wasn't to many hours unless you wanted over time, and that was always available. Also getting paid weekly was great as well. what I liked was that you had funny people so you didn't think about what you was doing. But what I didn't like was we would get overload and get backed up."
good,It was a fast paced job. It was very demanding physically. Must have a lot of energy and enthusiasm to maintain. Supervisors were really cool.
good,"UPS taught me to work smooth and efficiently, I grew used to interacting with customers on a day to day basis. I became familiar with my route that eventually everything became second nature."
good,"CDL drivers execute the job of transporting varied goods and trade materials ranging from hazardous materials and heavy construction goods to dry goods and frozen foods to corporate mail deliveries with the help of different transport or delivery automobiles. They abide by the company's safety policies and governmental transportation regulations during the transmission of commodities from distribution sites to client areas. "
good,"Usually and fast paced, Worked along side of others. Learned many skills that helped with multitasking and getting thing done efficiently , and in a timely manor."
good,"The customer is never wrong, so it could be hard sometimes trying to figure out what could you do to help him or her. When giving them options and other things that they don't want it can cause the employee to get aggravated to. With certain customers somethings can't be fixed but we try our best."
good,While employed at UPS I was able to learn how to talk to people confidently and manage my resources in the most efficient way possible.
good,Fast paced environment with a lot of good people. A loved the hours but it was very labor intensive. I've worked there for many years but recently moved and are looking for closer place to work.
good,"Fulfilled Contract, as a temporary employee it is difficult to review UPS as a workplace. My manager was remote, most of my assignments were travel related and when in the office everything was computer based with weekly team conference calls."
good,"Very professional and safety orientated work environment. Be prepared to learn their safety protocols, which you can always carry with you."
good,"It was good job and effective experience with respectful involvement."
good,ups is a good place to work i personally enjoyed it . friendly co-workers and nice staff that always get the job done. i learned many of things i did not know about aircraft's. the hardest part of the job was the whaether when it would rain . the best part of the job was driving .
good,Not one of the best places I have ever worked at.  Only seem to care about safety when it doesn't get in the way of production or when someone gets hurt.  A lot of politics in the management as far as I could tell.
good,The workplace was fun and the staff was a good group of guys. we had fun while working. Great company to work for while i was in high school.
good,"typical day includes loading packages into trailers."
good,Challenging position that instructed dispatched drivers daily to meet customer and building needs. Met pick up and delivery times with adding daily challenges that required quick thinking and patience.
good,A typical day at work depends on the day and how you structured your work time. I learned how to sale and negotiate. I learned how to reveal challenges to my clients.  Management is very supportive and understanding. My co workers are friendly and professional.  The hardest part of the job is having to create your own workload. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility.
good,"Great company good benefits, but lower management could be alot better. The employees are generally good. Hours are pretty good and you can generally find the right shift to not interfere with the rest of your life."
good,"Non stop working, only 10 minute break. It's Monday through Friday. You get weekends off though. It's heavy lifting up to 70 lbs. By yourself."
good,I enjoyed assisting the Driver and help him deliver packages in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was delivering Christmas packages during the holiday.
good,"Assigned to different project responsibilities"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being on the road delivering to people and companies,"
good,"I worked part time a supervisor and sorter, hardest part of this job was when we were under staffed, what I learned from this job is how to multitask and work underheavy pressure. The most thing I loved about thisjob was working with alot of great people."
good,"- Most days involve sending multiple reports of the previous days operation, supervising operations in the hub, and preparing the plans for the upcoming days"
good,"This job taught valuable skills such as how to interact with a customer, ideal customer service, training on Microsoft Office. Co-workers had great personalities and excellent customer service skills. What I enjoyed most about working at The UPS Store was the sense of community in the work place."
good,"Great company and great people if your looking for work and want to be surrounded by fun and active people, then go to UPS. Fun company just be ready for long days and to be tired everyday feeling good about what you accomplished."
good,I learned a lot about the shipping industry and how best to boxes.  The people I worked with were very knowledgeable which was helpful when the store got busy.  The hardest part of my job was to stay busy.  Some days were very slow and others were slow at times.  The most enjoyable part about working at UPS was meeting new people and helping them with their shipping needs.
good,"My Managerial skills have been polished working here. You definitely need a take charge attitude.  Again, it's a high paced environment."
good,"UPS is a huge company with lots of red tape and politics. It was difficult to know if I was successful in my job or not, because I was not a developer. Well I guess I know now that I wasn't, because I was fired as part of workforce reduction/ reorganization. The job was pretty monotonous. I feel that being in the wrong department / wrong job title was why I got let go.  If I had stayed in the Logistics side, I would probably still be working there."
good,"Great if you want to have fixed hours, and know what you will be doing Mon-Fri.  After the first year you can start making a good amount of money."
good,"The pay and benefits at UPS are great, however management does not look at the what the challenges men and women have loading three trucks."
good,"The job of package handler is fairly easy despite the weight restrictions. Contracts between the union and the company tend to make wages unfair amongst those who are building seniority. It is fairly easy to be promoted to a supervisor, with this there are many inexperienced individuals in supervisory positions that make your job more difficult. Although the company promotes to full time positions from within, the list is extremely long, based on seniority of at least 5 plus years and very slow."
good,"every day is another day of drama, and anger. I have been with ups for just a little over a year and I have to say it's a joke.  I start my day jumping from trailer to trailer putting bulk into the trailer. You learn that management will stab you in the back to save there self. If you co-workers do not show up you end up doing your job and their job too.  The hardest part of the job is rate after break when most the flow comes and screws up almost all production. In all honesty the most enjoyable part is when you clock out."
good,I had fun at work but it was to cold and to hot and they didn't a enough time one break but it was fun good working with them. It was a good and safe working environment and they pay you good and I know how and where package come from
good,"A very diverse environment, with many different personalities . The packages have priority over everything. The customer comes first. your job move 100,000 packages in 3.5 hours. You can do it and have fun at the same time. But the best part of the job is the people."
good,"started as a unload-er,loading feeders at night and doing clerk work,then i went to morning as a preloader loading trucks spliting the belt and clerking then a part time supervisor,then a driver work was very consistent stay busy the whole time you a there, learned a lot ,"
good,very fast pace place to work best benefits ever but upper management is very ugly to regular employees but plenty of room for advancement
good,This job is pretty interesting. It offers a diversity of employees as well as management. It's a place where anything is possible and it offers a number of opportunities that you can take advantage of.
good,"Friendly Environment."
good,"While working the dock at UPS was an enjoyable and learning experience for me, the major downside was that it is based on seniority. The men who worked their longer than I had were given the most work, while part-timers like myself were sent home earlier or laid off outright. Given this, advancement is very difficult unless you know the correct people."
good,I have worked for UPS for 23 years as a package Sorter and would recommend it to anyone looking for a job that features physical work and a chance to work with good people.
good,"Er hing een goede werksfeer. Flexibel rooster. Het werk was zeer gevarieerd, ik heb veel geleerd over logistiek."
good,"Great job learned a lot. After 21 years it was time to move on to my career and do something I love."
good,"Only worked there as a temporary employee, but the people were good and it seemed like a good place to work.  The company was bought out since I was there, so I don't know how the place is under new ownership."
good,"decent job, not hard at all, very physical, not for the weak-minded."
good,A very physical workplace that involved a lot of active movements. ive learned how to become the master of my abilities and the shareholder of my future.
good,"Enjoyed working at UPS meet alot of nice people, good first job."
good,The benefits are great and you will have job security as long as you come to work on time and ready to work. There is very little work life balance but the compensation is amazing.
good,"I had to run my area, keep it clean, daily paper work, run production, get done at a certain time, and cut back on my employees."
good,Supervise employees throughout the years to perform loading of packages into tractor trailers to be shipped to destinations around the country.
good,UPS is a fast paced environment with many opportunities for career advancement.  Through hard work and dedication you can find a career path within UPS.  UPS is dedicated to serving its customers safely and with the utmost quality.
good,"The Lenexa hub was awesome to work at but the KCK hub on James Street, was horrible. The management there sucks, and they made everyone hate coming into work."
good,Load your own truck and prepare for your two day trip to wherever your destined. Loved by all my delivery customers. Hones family environment.
good,"As a part-time Package Handler,  I have learned and still learning that you have to multitask and plan ahead for future events that may occur."
good,Challenging and rewarding job. There is constant movement in positions plenty to learn and improve on. The people are fun to work with.
good,"Enjoyed working for U.P.S. Management seemed to be on top of things such as MSDS training, Safety policies, equipment operations, and others situations that may need addressing. My favorite part of the job was watching the jets land and take off, the turkeys on Thanksgiving, the ocassional barbecue and the employees I got to associate with. United Parcel Service is one of the more proffesional companies I've worked with."
good,"A day at work is not bad but it could be annoying sometimes depending on the weather like hot with sun, cool with a breeze, wet with rain, or nice when worm. Ive learned about how customers feel when your the person delivering the merchandise that people have ordered some people can be cool and some just angry depends on how there day has been. Management is ok it could be better you really don't have co-workers because you may not be working with the same driver or helpers each day if you get the same driver then your lucky I usually get the same driver and there pretty cool because each driver has a different personality but if your stuck with a grumpy 1 good luck haha. I do enjoy being in the truck because that saves time with traveling on train but you do walk a lot depending on were someones house is located or how far there yard is. The down fall is it's a 50/50 chance to get picked to work after the season is over  because out of 50 helpers only 2 or 3 might get picked to be full time while you have to wait till next season to work again which kinda sucks but this company is ok could be better with hiring more people but depending on the position."
good,"Hard work, requires a lot of standing and lifting.  Great full-time benefits even though it is a part-time job.  The warehouse is very hot and humid during the summer and very cold in the winter.  The foul language between the workers and management is a turn off.  Immediately following being hired, employees qualify for tuition reimbursement."
good,If a part time position is what you are looking for then this job is a good one. You get to gain experience working with people and problem solving. Learning to deal with upset customers is valuable experience.
good,"Overall a solid job. Great full time benefits for a part time position. The hourly pay is competitive but some weeks you may only put in around 15 hours so it doesn't always show on pay-day. The only real problem I've run into (fairly large problem) is that you often get the sense that management sees their employees as merely a number. And they often treat you that way. Forcing production, cutting hours/staffing all to increase their production and profit. Understanding this is a business and that's one of their main focus', I feel they should still keep their workers condition (who are the ones doing this very physically demanding work) in mind. And they rarely seem to give any thought to that. But, all in all, I'd say its a solid job. A great job for part time students looking to take a break from the books and work a sweat into their daily schedule, also a good company to start low and work your way up!"
good,"The union protects their own and provides great benefits and raises. The work is no joke though, it's constant lifting, pushing, pulling and walking. But if you are willing to work hard there is room for advancement."
good,Die Arbeit ist zwar ein bisschen anstrengend aber sie macht mir viel Freude. Kollegen sind ganz in Ordnung.
good,"I only worked at UPS in a seasonal position so I don't really know how that company is and how it works. But based on what I have seen from the time that I was there is that the workers are really friendly, always willing to help and teach their coworkers. You need to learn quickly on the job because if you cant complete the job on time and in an efficient manner, then your driver/supervisor will be waiting for you constantly. Also you need to know the island and the routes of the island well just in case you get a route that is somewhere that you haven't driven before. Also being able to plan your day and route based on the freight that is given to you in the morning."
good,the job is great. it is not boring. It requires interaction with customers the entire time. You have to handle aggressive customers. Some technical issues are so hard to resolve which catches the majority of your time.
good,good place to work. equal job opps. hard working people great benefits and good place to gain labor experience. recommend to those seeking long hours with hands on labor
good,"Being a package handler took a lot of hard work and dedication to do your job right, but management helps you every step of the way. They understand it's hard work and try to lighten your spirits any time they think they can. Such a wonderful place to work if you don't mind getting dirty."
good,Working at UPS it's more of a mind thing then physical. You have to stay focus in the work that you do. This job isn't made for everyone. If you not coming to work then the job isn't for you
good,"I enjoyed working here, I just left this company to further my education in the electrical linework industry. I would recommend this career to anyone who would like to work inside a warehouse."
good,Great working environment! Customers were pleasant and the job was easy! More benefits were needed for store employees!
good,"A typical day starts with stretching, management letting us know how much packages we will be completing for the day, and then off to work. Overall, it can get extremely stressful especially during holiday season yet while it is a fast paced and physical job, it still is a decent place to work at."
good,required too much of drivers in efficiency verses safety which could result in safety failures. Managers over all were interested in drivers unless they were directly under them and responsible for their efficiency numbers.
good,"Best place I have ever worked the benefits, pay, and hours were perfect.  A typical day there was fast pace, which I love.  You work hard but are will compensated for it"
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,"I drive a cheery picker. Scan all product "
good,I mean this was my start of it all. UPS gave me a platform to build and review my skills. Starting off as a part time associate in just one year becoming a part time supervisor was a great experience.
good,"Great company, decent pay, flexible schedule. Love the flexibility they give me with my school schedule. Management is decent."
good,This was a great experience to have under my belt. For the short period of time for the seasonal time frame I was able to learn all sorts of things. The hours may be late but it is worth it if you have no kids.
good,A typical day at work started at different times each day and we didn't always get all hours we should have.  I learned a great deal while working at UPS.  Management doesn't always listen.  My co-workers were nice people to work with.  The hardest part of my job were the politics that were involved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the work done.
good,i worked here for 7 years and i have to say it is a great company if you know for sure you are going to stay with them for the rest of our working life. management is clueless when it comes to what the workers want when it comes to hours and recognition.
good,"UPS is a good job. They quick to hire and they need a lot of workers. Although I believe it to be a good job it is also a tough job, physically. But you know what you sign up for."
good,"As employee of UPS freight I was happy to do my job. There where issues with equipment and maintenance, but fot the most part it was an above average job. Employees where much on their own to accomplish assigned duties,"
good,if you like knowing you earned your paycheck everyday UPS is for you.  I went home tired everyday but made enough that it didnt feel like a waste of time.
good,"My typical day was unloading and loading trucks for shipments in and out of the UPS warehouse. The hardest part of the job was the continuous strenuous demands physically. After adjusting to this, it became easier with each shift. It was seasonal work, so I never had the same shift or time for reporting to work. Last minute adjustments made being prepared difficult."
good,"Good pay, long hours. Work / life balance is difficult. Training is on your own. Must ask alot of questions if you want to learn."
good,great company to work with if you enjoy delivery and intend on getting fit in the meanwhile. the environment is really fast paste and also fun!
good,"bien organiser la tournée du chauffeur es bien géré"
good,"overall the company was a good learning experience"
good,if you have no life and you need a bunch of money this the place for you.hot in summer cold in the winter.but its well paying job and the insurance best ive ever seen
good,"A regular day at work included face to face interaction with customers, helping over 100-200 a day. I learned the way shipping and packing works. Management was good, very focused on making our work life balanced. My co-workers were for the most part pleasant and we worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job would be the occasional outbursts from unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and being able to help them."
good,"Day at ups is 4 hours a day of non-stop lifting and lowering boxes. I learned that you can change your position but it will take time. Management are always breathing down your neck and very rude. I have no problem with my co-workers they come to work and do there job and go home."
good,"UPS was a very intense place to work. Moving packages from one place to another takes a lot of moving parts that work together. As a laborer, my day was straight forward. My job was to fill trailers with as many packages as I could, safely, at 300+ packages an hour for about four hours. As a supervisor, I had a lot of responsibilities. My day started out with a 20 minute meeting planning out the day. I would then setup my area and tell my employees their tasks for the day. During the day, I would need to update trailers, keep employees motivated and moving, help new employees, coordinate with other supervisors, and record my area's production for the shift."
good,"I have been working at UPS for over a year now, taking advantage of their wonderful and very supportive educational benefits; I enjoy my job and consider myself highly organized, competent and attentive to details, all of which are very important for success as an admin on an outgoing Next Day Air Belt service"
good,"ik deed daar inpakken voor alles in de vrachtwagen kon gaan."
good,"its cain of fun and demanding too u work with a qualified team , we all work in the same direction and in a safe method, i have some good coworkers , the management is good but need to improve on certain skills ,"
good,hit the guard shack walk into the building then hang up my belongings and wait until annoucnments and then go ahead and start work they call out your door. next you walk up to the door wait until the truck bags up then open the door . next you pull the extendo up to the truck and get all packages overs 70lbs off first then after that you strat to unload the rest of the truck for the rest of the night
good,"A typical day at work could vary any day of the week at The UPS Store. One day you may see a large print job such as making 500 business cards or several banners needed for an event. Another day you may see several antique glass pieces needing to be packed and shipped to Germany. Another would be on the phone for hours trying to settle a damaged package dispute. The list goes on and on. However, this broad array of tasks that could occur each day has allowed myself to  prepare for anything, and understand how to organize work in a proficient and timely manner. I have also been fortunate enough to work with some of my really close friends, three of which being my friends since childhood. This makes a huge difference in the workplace as far as entertainment, communication, and task cohesion go. The most challenging aspect of my job actually goes hand in hand with the most enjoyable aspect. When starting the job I found it overwhelming when being bombarded with several different tasks at once. In time, I began to adapt and find ways to work proficiently. Now that I have developed competence on each task, I really enjoy the since of accomplishment when completing several tasks in a professional manner."
good,typical day starts out with checking emails and compiling paperwork and numbers for our daily meeting. I learned a lot about how to successfully run a business as a team on a daily basis. Our management team had to work together nightly to make sure we met the goals held for us. I had great co workers and they made coming to work a lot more fun. Hardest part of the job was living up to the expectations at UPS. We set very high standards and you have to always keep your foot on the gas and continue to push forward. The other part is the hours and not seeing your family as much as you would like during the week. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with as well as seeing the drivers out on the roads delivering packages and knowing all the people that had to work together to get that package to where it needs to be on time.
good,"Gehalt ist immer Pünktlich und Leute sind freundlich."
good,"handling packages all day, sore a lot, some supervisors had a mean disposition, meaning they sometimes spoke to you any kind of way"
good,"With a strong work team, and easy to follow guidelines, UPS is an ideal place to be."
good,A typical day at UPS is very busy and fast pace. Working as a part-time supervisor for UPS you learn how to efficiently direct multiple task at once while managing a group of employees. Seeing how the job is hands on labor it isn't for everyone and a lot of people quit and you get new people who have to come in adjust quickly. Besides that they management and co-workers treat each others like a family.
good,"I worked mostly at night, and I liked the work environment. Management was good, as well as the co-workers. Everyone did thier job correctly."
good,I spent a lot of time learning how to ship nationally as well as internationally. Most of our clients were Canadian business owners which was very interesting if you just talk to them.
good,"Somewhere where you can learn a lot in a short amount of time. From office tools, to customer welcomeness, working at the UPS Store makes you a more well-rounded person."
good,"A typical day consists of managing a nightly package transport operation with an average of 11 unionized employees. While the basis of the operation is consistent, management is often challenged by outside circumstances (weather, staffing, operational malfunctions) to quickly and accurately send all packages to the correct destinations."
good,"I excelled in customer service Department, One of my responsibilities was to  book orders for customers and arranged  parcel pick-ups. Soon there after, that my experience was noticed management decided to promote me to the brokerage department, where parcels were held in customs,-- for custom release."
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS. A normal day involved:"
good,It was an short lived job but it was fun while it lasted it was a solid work out in the mooring the other co workers where cool but I disliked magement a great deal
good,Loved working here. The coworkers are great along with the management team. The opportunities with this company are endless.
good,Its a very challenging yet rewarding job. there are many perks to this job and its very team oriented. I really enjoy working there.
good,A typical day at work beings sorting boxes then loading them into the assigned trucks off the conveyor belts.This job taught me to be much more organized.Hardest part of the job is waking up in the early hours (2-3am).
good,"Great Company, a lot of opportunities available for younger employees, excellent benefit package. The company is focused on safety for all employees, also the company focuses on the employees overall well-being."
good,"Part time job, 3.5-5 hours a shift.  Good people, great benefits.   Physically and manually load or unload package trailers. Non-climate controlled."
good,"Fun place to work, can be difficult to move up in management. As with all places, culture is highly dependent on current management."
good,"waiting for inbound cargo planes to unload and reload to send out soon after"
good,"this job although dealing primarily on shipping, can involve attention to detail with it's various side projects. These projects can include graphic design, collating, printing, photocopying, etc."
good,"Working as an Un-loader.Loader for UPS was the most physically demanding job I've had. I worked on the pre-load shift which started and 4:20 a.m. and ran until approx. 8:30 a.m. My job duties included un-loading trailers full of packages, onto conveyor belts for processing into the system."
good,"Working for UPS was very informative and taught me a lot about managing resources and deadlines. Each day was a gauntlet of challenges from accelerated ""come down"" deadlines to balancing the management and labor union employee relationship."
good,Work day was rather early which give me time to get other things done throughout the day or even have a second job. It was pretty much easy going. Fast paced considering having to empty trailers within 35 mintues
good,"the work is relatively simple but it is extremely fast-paced, start work around 4 am leave at 9am. schedule is not consistant meaning they don't always need you to come in for work, great as a second job."
good,Typical work day is managing 8-10 employee's. I learned how to manage and be a leader. Co-workers are great. Hardest part is writing up an employee. Enjoyable part is meeting all deadlines
good,"it wasn't bad, it was only season work so I only got to experience peak season. hard fast paced work. it wasn't to bad working there. I would happily go back but I believe once you have worked there once there you cant go back. management was ok, co-workers were awesome. hardest part of the job was was the hours and the fast paced heavy lifting. most enjoyable part was the people"
good,"Responsibilities include calling on current business accounts that ship with UPS. As an inside sales representative, positioning services and products of UPS is key when discussing business supply chain with customers. The hardest part of the job is it involves growing the patch of land and improving from the previous years numbers."
good,"worked very hard, the hardest part of the job was the speeding of the boxes coming into the trailer and the enjoyable part was pizza on certain days of the week"
good,UPS is a cool company to work for. The have a great benefit package if you are able to convert from temporary agent to full time UPS tech.
good,"Op het werk is altijd druk, er is helaas weinig te leren want elke dag is het zelfde (bijna) en ik werk er al zolang dat ik alles al ken."
good,"Very physically demanding work and often times of inclement weather. Overall, good company to be employed with opportunities for growth."
good,"Lots of running for a long period of time. But if you can handle it, its not that bad of a job. Delivering packages all day. The co workers are fine. Very simple work. Keep track of your hours. Very long hours"
good,"Good company to work for, great people to work with and a fun, yet productive work environment. Very hard work in the warehouse at night time unloading the package cars and loading semi tractor trailers. Getting a driving position is very hard to wait for considering you must be on call everyday to drive, therefor it is hard to have a day job as well as work the night shift. But, at the same time only working 20 hours a week does not suffice when trying to support a family."
good,"As this assignment was for a relatively short time period I may not have gotten a full grasp of the company."
good,"This job really depended on the position. When I was driving on the roads, I loved it. Good workout and pay. When I was in the warehouse, the hours decreased dramatically. On my busiest week, 25 hours. It's ideal for part-time, but that's it. Management did their best when it came to helping me out with certain issues, but communication could use improvement."
good,Good place to work while in college. Has different shifts that provide college students to work while still having a lot of time off to study.
good,"If you like to work with no one watching over you, this is the job for you! A typical work day ranges anywhere between 8-10 hours. For the most part your co-workers are pretty helpful."
good,"When I started it was great.  Very Hard work. When I started loading, I couldn't understand how anyone could missload packages. There might be one missload a month for the entire crew. After a new manager took over we were luck too only have one missload per day.  Its simple, there were running the belt too fast and you have too many different things at once. (The incident command system was created after it was realized that people can typically only keep track of 5 separate things at one time for a sustained period of time without degradation of ones abilities and without forgetting key units of information). In any case the manager created a hostile environment which made me worse at my job so I ended up quitting. many co workers expressed sympathy and agreed with my observations."
good,"UPS has been good to me and my family. Being a in a 24 hour, time-sensitive industry does makes it a challenging place to work. One of the most enjoyable aspects of my job is that it keeps me very busy so the day passes quickly. UPS has a lot of good people.  UPSers performing volunteer projects have a reputation for getting an enormous amount of work done in a short amount of time, and doing it with quality."
good,"A typical day at work was lovely, to watch airplanes come and go every night is a scenery. What I learned about this job was mandatory safety. My team supervisor was a lovely nice team leader, as so as others. But other supervisors change as the levels of work desires is a different story. The co-worker were decent, we worked as a team but were diversity. The hardest part of this job was working on the bottom side of the aircraft loading and unloading hundreds of various packages. The most enjoyable part of this job was the lovely breaks and to be able to work on an airplane every night."
good,"It's Okay, Simple Stuff, Mostly Getting On & Off A Truck Delivering Packages With The Driver."
good,"Being a driver helper for UPS was pretty easy, My job was just to help the driver deliver the packages to the current house. It was fast paced.Enjoyed the job because we were basically cruising to each house."
good,Load and unload import-export freight.Pick up and deliver freight.Learned how to properly handle import-export freight.Upper management not concerned with employees.Immediate supervisors good people and easy to work for.Hardest part of job is breaking down air pallets.
good,Do your duties as quickly and safely as possible. The end of day time was spent in the office doing timecards and busy work. Refer to my resume to better understand some tasks done daily.
good,"Ride nine hours a day on a package car w/ different drivers Mon - Thu using a PDA to log their route and actions.  Fridays the information from the PDA was uploaded to a network pc to reconcile the information w/ each driver's routes.  The most difficult part of the job was being in the package car 9 hrs out the day w/ no air conditioning and constantly getting in/out of them for each delivery.  I enjoyed Fridays at the office as they were short, more cerebral than physical, and air conditioned.  What I absolutely detested was the driver's labor union.  I was offered to stay on as management after the internship, but chose not to because while at the main building every driver behaved confrontational as though management were the enemy, but would become friendly as soon as they left the facility and each other for deliveries.  It created a counter-productive environment."
good,"I first speak with the team address any issue that we may have. I will take them up with upper management if need be. I will then reply to all emails in the order they where received. any meeting schedule I will attend in a timely fashion. Create memo for the meeting after attending so that if anything I need to discuss with my team I can address them. I assign all work needed for the week and talk with co-workers making sure that know team member is struggling and needs help do to other projects that they may be helping on."
good,A great place to work especially if  your young and only want part time work. The pay isn't as good neither are the hours but staff and employees were great and it was a very easy job. I learned a lot from the older people and would love to come back if the pay was better.
good,"Once in the door the pay is good, the hours are decent. It is a self satisfying position with opportunity to grow within the organization"
good,"UPS - United Parcel Service (1986-1987)"
good,"was fun while it lasted, well trained and well compensated."
good,Great career good benefits. The only downfall is becoming unionized is hard.
good,"Working here was a great learning experience. I worked all three stores became a co-manager and was taught some office duties that you would be able to apply to a office job. I liked working here. It gave me an opportunity to meet new people, was taught new things, and had a great time. (I left due to wanting to continue my education. The hours were not negotiable to go to college night classes)."
good,"Good place to work part time, late hours but not long. Management left something to be desired but overall a good place to work. Wonderful benefits, good pay, access to overtime if desired. Easy to pass time quickly with constant work to do."
good,"The coworkers were friendly, and it was a simple matter to get anything you needed done.  Management was open to questions, but would often forget who was trained in what areas, leading people to get asked why they didn't know how to do something yet.  Personally I left because I was expected to work 30 hours a week spread over Mon-Sat, which just gets draining, despite having the time in my college class schedule to condense the hours."
good,"Everyday there is a challenge that you must overcome. It is easy to think negatively but here there is teamwork to help get the job done. I respect my supervisors and my co-workers. Some of the toughest parts of the job are making decisions that affect the group, not just yourself. The most enjoyable part is the service that we provide to our customers."
good,"Stable, but pretty strict. Not too many activities. Kind of dull really"
good,Learned the ins and outs about shipping. Learned alot of customer service skills as far as dealing with different people.
good,"i really enjoyed working at UPS for the peak season, it is very hard work though, so don't come in thinking it will be easy. You will give up a lot if you get on and work for them, you will not have dinner with your family because you will be out past dinner time every evening, You pretty much wake up, go to work, come home, enjoy an hour or two before going to bed.....and do it all over again the next day. The compensation though, is really good, so you will have to decide whether this is for you or not. I wish I could get on as a driver full time, but there are quite a few people waiting in line. I am 43 years old, married for 22 years, and I am one of the few who (at this age), would LOVE to get on here!! I know what to expect, so it is no surprise to me."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure the belts don't turn off. Making sure the packages get into the right trailers. You will learn that you must work at a fast pace or your work area will be a mess. Some managers are hard on the employees, but some are easier to work with. Since its a team effort your co-workers are expected to help you when things get overwhelming. For most people the hardest thing about this job is working at a fast pace. In most case the thing that people usually like about this job is the people they meet."
good,Was a fast pace environment.  I loaded semi trailers and sorted through packages.
good,"plenty of training , holiday work , good management team ,would of loved to stay full time ,great pay , great hrs , just no benefits , no job security after holiday ,employees very helpful in training temps, hardest point learning where to go for deliveries, ounce you have that part down you can do the job ."
good,National company that offers great rewards but local sr management has serious issues.
good,This is a well established freight company. Highly keen on quality and reputation. Will do anything (within business ethical line) to gain trust and business.
good,it was a fun face paced job a really great learning experience
good,"Working For UPS You'll Be Around For A While. Especially Around The Holidays It Gets Really Busy But, Its Fun"
good,easy and fun if your a hard worker. great place to learn how to lift packages correctly.
good,"Great people to work with,and unsteady temperature, and great discounts"
good,"A typical day at work consists of dispatching return service requests to drivers. Delivery links. In building scans,customer service and dispatch of pick ups."
good,Always looking for promotions and multiple shifts to choose from. Tuition assistance a big plus for college students. Management can be stressful but job security is there.
good,The job was fairly easy .Co workers were nice . The Enviroment was fairly cold but still was working condition .
good,liked the job alot people worked under me were good and the managment over all was good too had good insurance but lost some ensentives here and there was disappointed they wouldnt transfer me but understand
good,"I loved the job, hour's and pay. Management was great. It was just a seansonal job."
good,"great company and excellent equipment pay is great n benefits. "
good,This is a labor intense job requiring physical activity and much repetition. The benefits are great and most employees seem to be focused on the same goal and get along with each other.
good,a lot of hard workers for the most part and we work together with packages that are too much for others
good,Ups was a good place to work. Supervisors were okay under a lot of pressure to get production.
good,"Meet different characters and personalities. Everyday is a learning experience with UPS. There is always something new or being updated, taking test etc. Management is fair, love the people I work with. Hardest part is telling a customer that your unable to retrieve their parcel. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I am surrounded with."
good,"Heavy work load. co- workers are very immature"
good,3rd shift. Typical day would be from 2:30 in the morning till after 9AM. Very fast pace. Memorizing addresses and zip codes. Becoming a part time supervisor brought on more responsibility. Problem solving skills.Quick thinking.  Built strong leadership skills. Always a good feeling when there were no packages left in your area that you didn't have to deliver after all the drivers were gone.
good,"Heavy machinery, load noises with a high work pace. Always on your feet."
good,"I would have loved to keep this job if it didn't wear down my body so much. I am a petite female and I could not keep up with the company standards. If you can lift 60lb boxes consecutively for 5 hours without a problem, then this is the job for you. I wish I were taller and had more strength. The people who work there (depending on where your assigned) are generally very helpful. The benefits are awesome and they give you discounts on a lot of different companies as well as tuition reimbursement. If you can stick it out in a trailer, being buried alive by boxes and have it reach up to 110 degrees, then I say go for it. The benefits are absolutely worth it. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!"
good,"The job was very fast paced and require my energy. I had to be on my feet every day and stay ahead of everything. I had to scan, label, and lift bags for four hours. I had a ten minute break. It was usually slow paced in the morning but become very fast paced in the afternoon. Management was very friendly and offered helpful tips and advice on how to get tasks done efficiently. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful at times, thus making the work experience enjoyable. Lifting bags was an excruciating task and required every ounce of my physical strength. The most enjoyable part of the job was removing old labels and putting on new labels. The hardest part of the job was lifting bags filled with apple Iphones. Apple Iphones were heavy as solid bricks."
good,Great Place to work. They outsourced our department. A typical day at work would be training associates on any new proceedures and making sure associates were current.
good,Great advancement possibilities.  Not a very good work/life balance.
good,"If you cant handle the outdoors, stress and customer contact then this job is not for you."
good,"Nothing very special. You sell things, check-in packages, and occasionally organizing all the stuff in storage. The holiday season gets really hectic."
good,Early morning call. Fast paced & demanding standards. Plenty of room for advancement.
good,I only worked seasonally. the work hours were decent. My driver was awesome. A lot of running and walking.
good,My day was usually fast pace and easy going. Some loads bigger or smaller than the other. I learned that it takes great integrity and responsibility to deliver packages to a variety of people. My co-workers were friendly and energetic. Average people doing great deeds. I would say delivering the heavy loads of packages and using their device called the DIAD was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around positivity and working for a well-known company.
good,"UPS has great compensation packages for both hourly employees as well as management.  Also, the company invests in its employees.  You will get ALL the training you need to do your job, and if you stay with the company there is a lot to learn."
good,Started out tracing packages in the Austin TX. (part time thru an agency) Offered full-time data entry. Keyed in various job in regards to drivers deliveries:  time cards etc
good,"Great benefits,  a good job to keep you in shape, (no need to go to the gym), excellent salary when you put the years in. They have monthly bbq's, safety incentives, optional overtime during peak season, 401k, stock options, pension, medical,  vision, dental, ( paid for thru the union/company). Yearly raises. The work is hard and starting salary low, but stick with it and the pros Will out weigh the cons."
good,My favorite thing about this job was meeting with my staff. It was a group of very young and creative people. I liked to support my team and helped to solve problems
good,clean friendly enviroment no micro managing.. good hours flexible schedule
good,"This job was a part time job. It required heavy lifting, and personal accountability. Every day I'd have to unload between 6 to 7 cargo truck, which included 1618 wheel trucks. "
good,"The staff at UPS were all young so the work day was always a fun and breezy day no matter the work load. A typical day would consist of us joking and laughing while listening to the radio standing at our work station keying package descriptions until the shift was complete. The management team was sometimes hard on us for laughing and joking around so much because we were still in a professional setting even though it was centered in the middle of a warehouse. I learned the importance of detail in this position because if a description was keyed and the weight of the package didn't match what its assumed to be, there was a consequence that resulted in being written up or being sent home for the day. The hardest part of the job was getting there on time. It was a major conflict because me and my older brother shared a vehicle and he didn't get off from his job until 5:00 with me having to be to work by 6:00"
good,Decent pay with excellent benefits however the constant bickering between the workers union and management make it some times feel like a hostile environment
good,"Communication is the key to a successful operation. Without employees, my job would be to no avail, therefor, it is important to manage and satisfy employees to be a successful leader. Every team is expected to be victorious, that is why it is vital to choose the correct leader. Production performance is not a difficult goal to accomplish, with daily appraisals to each employee you can create a  successful and work-friendly environment. As management it is imperative to make expeditious decisions; this will also base the production performance, excellent customer service, and managing employee work hours and behaviors. Co-workers must have an understanding within each other of how important it is to implement teamwork, proactive decision-making, leadership, and daily pre and post Supervisor/ Manager meetings. At times it can be difficult to understand that as manager I will always be in between the employees and the hierarchies. So any decisions made will be unsatisfied with one or the other, but even at that my decisions will always be ethical. In conclusion, the most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to interact with everyone in the hub whether it's before, during, and after the operation.  I also enjoy going into work and knowing everyday there is always something new expected; Versatility and diversity must be expected from everyone."
good,very fast paced place to work but good opportunity to advance and a great place to get into shape
good,I would meet the UPS driver at set location around 3pm and help deliver packages until about 9pm. I learned how to deliver packages with hand held kiosk and place packages where they cant be seen.  The hardest part was doing apartment complexes by myself. I enjoyed riding around delivering packages.
good,"Wonderful company, tense Company v. Union culture at my location. Offers fast paced workout in my current role with great health benefits, tuition assistance, and discounts on public transportation and other services."
good,this job was run the co workers was amazing the team work in the management staff worked as one to complete task safe in quickly
good,Very productive place to work.  I am responsible for performing at a high level of service for a long period of time
good,"I worked 4-5 hours Monday through Friday. My job consist of breaking jams, loading and building walls in a trailer. I learned safe working habits are the key things to performing the job as a package handler at ups. symbols and various signs are also what i have learned from ups.The managers and co workers are very helpful and are friendly. The physical labor is the hardest part of working at ups as a package handler. the benefits and your physical health will improve while working for ups."
good,"Inventory order picking"
good,"UPS values hard work above all things, and rewards that work with good pay and benefits, as well as opportunity.  Because of their ""get it done"" mentality, which provides a very diligent and dependable service to their customers, they are struggling to include safety in their culture as a core value.  Overall would recommend as a quality place to work."
good,A typical day at work I'm loading boxes ensuring each package and shelf is secure and safe. Ive learned how to work fast while maintaining safe habits. the hardest part of my job would be watching others slack off while I work hard. The most enjoyable part of the job would be walking out the door.
good,"My day started by arriving 45 minutes early for the nightly supervisor meeting. We reviewed errors from the previous day, analyzed employee performance, and set goals for the upcoming shift.  "
good,Managers are cool to be around and easy going people there. the job is fast paced really not worth what they are paying i would suggest finding another job. During the seasons its terrible impossible to tried to keep up but we were able to do overtime that was great.
good,"Very customer and employee oriented,  Lots of employee discounts and promotes welliness."
good,fast paced work environment. Very early hours. Friendly work space
good,"fast pace work environment, great benefits for part time employees, physically demanding, strong work ethic is mandatory."

good,"I worked with UPS as a Driver Helper this past holiday season, and it was everything I had hoped for and more."
good,"unload trucks at doc"
good,"Nice people, but no longer there."
good,"Drivers were nice, easy work since I'm athletic and can handle being on my feet and lifting objects."
good,"Very hard, stressful work. Competitive wages and very nice benefits"
good,This was a good starting point for my management career but I was limited in advancement opportunities at my particular location.
good,"The day involves reporting to office and later proceeding to field on customer visits. On customer visits you get to understand the nature of the business and key logistics requirement. "
good,"Nice place to work, hard to get a full-time job. Part-timers can have their hours cut back to 15 hours. A lot of opportunities to change departments if you like working over-night."
good,It is a lot of lifting of boxes I say if you do not want to get dirty or have aches then UPS is not the job for you.  The management is ok i think they could have better candidates that can relate better with the co workers to make them feel comfortable and willing to come to work.
good,"Great benefits but you have to work there at least a year. They also offer tuition reimbursement. Not a great work environment for me, personally."
good,very fast paced. Attention to detail is vital with this job.
good,I didnt do much on the job but it was great to help the driver with his delivery of packages to there destination and to see the satifaction of the people face on that christmas season how happy they was to see there package arrive on time  thats was enjoyable to see on the job
good,Your career path depends on you with this company. If you are able to think outside the box and willing to go above and beyond you can learn a lot. Many wonderful customers and a lot of knowledge to be gained if you desire.
good,"UPS seems great, but the work can be quite demanding for the level of compensation and the union often shifts compensation and benefits towards full time workers at the expense of part timers that work just as hard (and sometimes harder)."
good,I learned that time is the key and work hard and safe. it was fun and you got to work any type of weather
good,I received gratification solving my customers problems.  Co workers helped each other out when needed.
good,"you will work close with mechanics, prepare for your cloths to get dirty. work environment is great for people who likes field work"
good,"I helped deliver packages.  It is pretty simple."
good,Great part time job. Full benefits after 18 months of service as a part timer. Very physical job your an industrial athlete.
good,I would meet my driver at 1PM and then we would drive to where he left off. We would deliver packages to different homes. I learned a how to stay focus an multitask.My driver showed me and everything and it was a pleasure working with him. The job was not very hard just had to pay close attention. I enjoyed not working in one location i got to move around.
good,I work for The UPS Store 2582 which is a small business. This has given me an opportunity to use what I have learned working for a major corporation and get the feel what it takes to run a small business.
good,"A wonderful part time opportunity for any college student. The hours during the summer are few but during the winter holidays there is more then enough. Which is great for buying presents or saving up for spring break. A wonderful work environment that helps advance your customer service skills, communication, and computer knowledge as well as various other office machines."
good,"The hardest part of my job was peak season, it was crazy trying to deal with all the many changes to the day to day work.  The best part of my job was interaction with the employees, I liked working with them to resolve problems and provide guidance and training on how to provide the needed information so they didn't have additional problems.  I learned how to manage effectively in working as management in a union environment,   The people I work with are the greatest, they can deal with the most stressful day and at the end of it, it's a we did it!  I worked well with my management team, they have a difficult job.  A typical day was keying payroll, meeting deadlines, paying bills, reconciling hours and working with employees on corrections, pension issues and vacations."
good,Ups is a very good paying place to work. They do how ever micro manage ever aspect of your work day. Most of the time you are off on your own
good,"nice and quite job "
good,"All about safety and loading the trucks the right way. You will not get bored here, too much to do, too little time."
good,"Great place to work at, very good salary pay, great benefits."
good,Mostly Part time shifts. Rigorous physical work. Days consist of loading/ unloading trailers and sorting product. Job security is Solid. Not a very employee oriented system.
good,"As a seasonal employee, I was not exposed to much of the typical workplace atmosphere, but I never met anyone that wasn't courteous and polite.Typically, I met my assigned driver at a predetermined location and delivered packages to the public until we were out of packages. I really enjoyed my interactions with customers the most. They made the day much more enjoyable. The most difficult aspect of the job was the freezing cold. It's already challenging running up and down driveways a couple of hundred times a day, but the cold certainly doesn't help."
good,"My typical day consist of working approximately four hours of which I have to sort 140,000 to 200,000 packages amongst 70 people. I've learned to sort via zip codes and scanning methods. The management/supervisory staff is helpful and understanding especially in climate weather. My co-workers and I form a great team to get the job done on daily basis. I am a member of the UPS safety team and I mentor new employers. I also perform daily observations on the floor to ensure staff is working within the safety protocols."
good,"une emploi en interim de 10mois pas le niveau sécurité de l'emploi mais très bonne ambiance le salaire est très attractif, des horraires certe bizard mais satisfaisant quand on a pas de famille et même si on en a une"

good,"job was to sort parcels and letters, unloading and loading of trucks"
good,Part time work with felible hours and they have a competitve wage
good,"Work was easy and straightforward, involving basically just a lot of common sense, not much more. UPS is a well-organized corporation which takes good care of and appreciates its employees."
good,"A typical day starts with entering in a building called a ""Guard Shack"" where you are waved and checked for deadly possessions. immediately after, you are transported to your assigned work area by a tram (approximately fifteen minute ride). Next, you then meet with your crew and supervisor for briefing and safety tips for the night. Then, you stretch and begin work, which includes driving equipment used for loading planes, loading and stacking packages in the planes, as well as unloading packages from the planes."
good,I would advice this job through college but acquiring full time positions takes upwards of 8-10 years.
good,The drivers are extremely nice and take their job very seriously. It's a very fast paced job. I learned that you got to hide packages and be creative about doing it. The hardest part on the job is you get very little breaks during the day so you can use as much of the day light as possible. The best part is meeting new people and seeing them being happy.
good,"I have learn lots about my job about courer feild & clearin side."
good,Hard work and short hours. Good camaraderie amongst employees.
good,Never have I worked so hard and still respected my superiors!
good,A company that trust in the talents they adquired and invest a lot in their trainings to be competitives in the logistics market.
good,"UPS is tough work but, you get what you put into it.  Benefits only cost 150 dollars a year for your family, those are your union dues and you pay nothing else for amazing health plans."
good,"Management instructs employees, some employees complain but still comply."
good,"Clasificación de la mercancía y preparación de la mercancía por zonas de reparto antes de comenzar la carga del vehículo para salir a reparto."
good,"I've only been working for a couple months my hours were really low for the first few weeks, but now going into the holidays it is picking up quite a bit, Everyone from top to bottom is very friendly and seems to care even though I am only seasonal, they appreciate hard work and will let you know you are doing a good job, but I wish I had an idea whether or not Ill have a chance at a job position after my seasonal time is up."
good,Its has great benefits but it's only because of the work is much harder than how it sounds
good,"There is no typical day at UPS. Everyday is different and challenging. I have learned to multitask to a very high level. In terms of management, managers are approachable and down to earth. You feel as part of a family once you join the management team. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the people motivated to to the same job everyday. The best part of the job is knowing, once the day is done, customers will receive their goods when they expect it."
good,"On a typical day, I load semi-trucks with freight assigned with the same destination as the truck. UPS is has great benefits such as healthcare and college tuition payment. Management is fair to the employees, and a workers union guarantees the workers certain rights. The hardest part of the job is working the graveyard shift, and the most enjoyable part is the sense of accomplishment I get after finishing a difficult load."
good,"As I did not have my full licence I was just an assistant, an extention of the driver , if you will., I was able to work on my own at least 80-90% of the time unless it was a light day with less than the normal amount of deliveries, and if that was the case then it was an early day for me, "
good,"Hard work, steady but advancement is very limited.  The insurance is great but to actually a stable growing income it takes well over 10years."
good,Everyday we would unload freight trucks and load stock cars to deliver the clients' packages.
good,"easy job and houly pay, not for higher eduction person, high school graduate is ok"
good,"A typical day involves moving thousands of boxes, ranging from 1 lb all the way up to 70 lbs in rapid succession anywhere from by my feet to above shoulder level. It would be fine if i did not always feel like sort isle was getting handicapped to increase the work flow to it and by proxy the rest of the building. It did teach me how to manage myself when i feel i am being overwhelmed. The work on the sort isle is however, mindless. After you get the hang of it you don't have to think about it anymore and that can leave you watching the clock or otherwise bored out of your skull. I do enjoy running irregulars, box's 71 lbs and up. Doing this allows me to work my mind as well as my body as i have to figure out how I will fit the boxes onto the carts for transport."
good,it was a good job to have overall in the end .. very physical hard work w the union and having the health insurance that was available made it worth the hard effort
good,Its a fast paced fun place to work Co workers are great and so are the customers. A excellent environment to build on and develop new skills.
good,"the pay and benefits were great except the working hours were  not  "
good,"when i walk into my present job i can expect to do any job"

good,"Worked Graveyard, learned how to drive Class B vehicles, loved my co-workers, management was awesome, hardest part of the job was balancing my sleep during the day so that I could stay awake at work, my most enjoyable part of the job was loading the planes. After the planes were loaded I got to watch them fly away."
good,"- Enjoyed coming into work on a daily basis"
good,"Great place to work, excellent retirement, benefits were good, compensation was below average, and 3rd shifts were tough."
good,"Hard work, but rewarding. Like being paid to go to a gym, haha. Management is generally pretty receptive, but its very case by case. Expect to be dead tired every day for at least two weeks while you adjust to the work load."
good,"As a forklift driver, I was responible for the loading parcels into trucks"
good,"fast paced loading and organizing."
good,"My day Started at 8 Pm and ended at 12am, A typical day for me was doing a job that was simple yet effective,tedious but rewarding and time consuming but productive.I didint get a chance to interact with the manager as much as I would hoped,but when I did meet him on occasions it was like interacting wih my coworkers which had the work ethic and knowledge to perform the job at hand.What I learned at the job which was a testament to my work ethnic,that was unfazed untainted and unbroken throughout the shift.The easiest part of the job was that the high up positions had applied faith in the many workers in the hub which was on hog island road.The hardest part of the job was not being there for that long to perform the task at hand which was only four hours everytime I went in,So overall a nice experience with the potentail for growth."

The management is great love working with the employees, everybody works together great."
good,"I do enjoy working here, although I really wish that there was benefits for me as I have been here for 5 years and I do not get paid time off, vacation, maternity leave or any other benefits and it kind of makes me think that I should look for something that will help me in the long run."
good,There is stability with this company and they offer a competitive benefits package. They also help pay for your education

good,"Interesting place to work at. You learn a lot about the company, and they are open and willing to hire beginners and teach them all they need to now. Training and help is always available."
good,I worked Monday through Friday on night shift and I really enjoyed it. You work with your own crew of people and you have a supervisor. Unloading and loading the planes wasn't that bad but some of the boxes were heavy. I worked in the winter time so it was cold. I liked my co-workers. 
good,"Managed a group of 20+ employees."
good,"I enjoyed my part-time hours but the work was numerous and swift. The break extremely short. The people or employees were great. It was really a cool atmosphere, where you could talk to the other employees like you were family and work at the same time. A good job for beginners."

good,"Good job,with pretty nice benefits, but seeing that's it's part time, this isn't enough to live off of. "
good,A typical day at ups was busy. The management was cool and my co workers were great.
good,the hardest thing about that job was lifting heavy boxes in 90 degree weather
good,A typical day at UPS would be non stop work but the people are wonderful as long as your doing your job and management is ok.  Their is a risk of being injured at the job though.
good,This was a pretty easy job for a college student.  I packed and shipped packages to various destinations all over the world. I learned valuable customer service skills as well as computer skills that will help me in the future.  The environment and culture of this job was exactly what I wanted when I was looking for a part-time job while still in school.  Both the General Manager and store manager were very helpful and great people to work for. 
good,"My day at work would consist of me setting up my load truck with a provided load stand to help loading my truck accordingly as taught. I have learned how to load a truck with proper barriers to assure safety and results in getting the package to the customer with satisfaction. My co workers are responsible for their assigned truck and also, like myself, lending a helping hand to get things done in a matter of time. The hardest part of my job is the accuracy in quality they expect while loading the trucks. I can say, i enjoy the workout it gives me because you have to be in shape to proceed in many of the task given."
good,"A typical day included unloading around 45,000 packages sorting them and loading them into brown trucks for delivery. "

good,"My typical workday began at 4 AM in order to get packages where they needed to be delivered. I learned all aspects of the distribution, dispatch, safety, and operational functions of the company and while I mastered those skills was never recognized for having the initiative and drive to move up and lead others. I enjoyed all my co-workers and our center was like a tight-knit family, however waiting 5-7 years for promotion to full time was not an amount of time I could wait on financially or occupationally."
good,"Challenging busy learned a lot managment was good depending on whom, the hours where hard very hard on the body sleep wise the hardest part of the job ...getting up at 1:00 in the morning best part the pay"
good,"This was a wonderful place to work because it taught me about time management, organization, and dealing with all types of people. The hardest part of the job was the people I encountered. Some of them were not the most pleasant people, but I just had to learn how to deal with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning about who they were."
good,A typical day at UPS was always busy. A place where I had to go fully rested and ready to start lifting heavy boxes. I learned that trying to do my tasks alone was not the best thing. Co-workers were awesome always there by my side to help out. The hardest part of the job was getting terminated due to an injury that happened while on the job. The most enjoybale part was I loved my job.
good,A company with a wide varity of different cultures.It pushes for womans leadership as well as minority advancement within the company. Offers different advancement opportunities whteher in a managment position or skilled laborer. The hard parts of the job are the hours and climate of the warehouse. In addition pushing your body to deal with these obstacles.
good,"I work odd hours at this job. This job has molded me to work with a sense of urgency when I am on or off the clock. Management can be overbearing at times; however, its only because they are striving to meet a deadline. My co-workers are the same as me in working with a sense of urgency to meet the daily goal, but they are also fun to talk with during break time. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the work flow because it moves extremely fast. the most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork and being a part of the team that gets the job done daily."
good,typical day was loading trucks lifting moving in a fast pace I've learned to moves in a fast pace and give my all the management was wonderful ans so as my coworkers the hardest part of the job was no break because it was part time the most enjoyable part was working with a great team.
good,"Each day could be different depending on the problems of the day. Some days were chaos, but some days less challenging."
good,"Extremely difficult place to work. Exposure to extreme temperatures (non AC warehouse), management is extremely hard on its workforce, the Teamsters Union is a monster to deal with, and the work flow per day is almost sweatshop like. On the other hand, they pay fairly decent and the benefits are phenomenal."
good,"A typical day consist of encouraging and delegating task to 11 employees. I supervise their work. My job is to ensure that every package makes service, no one gets hurt, and that everyone gets along. I have learned over past few years how to manage people. My co-workers have been great to learn from. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone. It simply not possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is investing in my employees. I enjoy working with people."
good,Good people to work with.
good,Working at UPS as a Driver Helper was a lot of fun. The driver in which I was assign to was very respectable. I don't think the pay was appropriate for the work load. UPS should be ashamed!
good,Managed a crew of approx 30 associates that loaded trucks. Had to meet very strick deadlines with zero acceptance of not doing this. I learned here how to manage associates that was older than I and how to deligate and hit deadlines.
good,Depending on the amount of parcels to deliver might make you day long or short.
good,Great company on values and integrity. Great co-workers. No day is the same. Presented with many opportunities to hone detail and professional skills.
good,Working for CCR was stocking multiple stores each day. I did not work in a CCR owned building. All work was in the field.
good,"I have been working at UPS for almost 6 years now. It started out as just a job for benefits, but now that I have some time in, I bring home a decent amount of pay. This is a dirty job, and the economy leaves little room for advancement to a full-time position as there are many drivers on lay-off right now. But if you are self-employed, run your own business, or just need another part time job, it is a good option. Management is willing to work with you as long as you show up on time and do what you are told. It is a blue collar job, so it can get a bit rowdy, but we are allowed to listen to our personal audio devices. Working the morning shift is great because we are usually out of there by 830."
good,"I worked from 9-5:30 with a 30 minute lunch, work would normally be slow on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, due to dealerships being closed on Monday and not ordering much on Friday and in the middle of the week. Tuesday and Thursday, however, would normally provide plenty of work as dealerships just opened and put in all their orders. Management chain was as expected you started low and everyone worked their way up above where you started, but everyone seemed to understand their management and tolerated it. Co-workers were fun and relaxed the majority of the day and always were a pleasure to be around despite where you went to work that day in the factory. The hardest part of the job was just being able to cope with all the misunderstandings and errors that seemed to occur from Triumphs end or sometimes or own, but that made you learn to take charge for your mistake and benefit from it. The most enjoyable part of my job was just walking in the mornings, having a meeting and being able to see how everyone was that day and knowing whether or not it would be fun today or not."
good,"It's OK I guess, 4 hours shift 10 minute break, management wants you to work 24/7 but don't what you to get overtime for some reason. (overtime after 5 hours in warehouse) Hardest part unloading hundreds of boxes ranging from 1-160lb boxes for three hours straight then starting back up for the last hour, Most enjoyable is the other workers that you laugh and talk trash with the whole time but still being serious about your job at the same time."
good,"Great management, but hard to move up the latter though. They rub a the company very professionally."
good,"Work hard and fast. Learned lots of new areas in Charlotte NC. Some management was so great to work with when others were almost impossible to be around. Overall good and very skilled in what their jobs and tasks were. Co-workers were all good and easy to work with. Hardest part was simply just hard work,but was a sence of accomplishment at the end of the day."
good,I was greatful and appreciative of the opportunity to work for UPS. I was able to support myself and my kids and live comfortably but in return I worked long hours and basically had no life outside of UPS. Overall a good job but u definitely work hard.
good,"I would work from 11pm to 4am, it was very hardworking but got the job done and the box's off the belts and into the proper cages. I learned that everything that gets shipped out is based on a code by color and numbers. My boss's and co-workes were fun to work with, laughed and just talked about random things. I felt very rewarded because i flet good that i helped all the packages to get out on time."
good,"Go to the private schools in Avon and Farmington, go and help the kids pack up there dorm rooms and have them send there stuff were ever they wanted. learned that there are certian way to pack certian packages. Co-worker's and Boss's were always down to earth and alwasy on there toes. Hardest part about the job was the climbing 4 flights of stairs with heavy box's, most enjoyable part of the job was that everything i did felt very rewarding."
good,this is a physical job and good exercise
good,I was with this company for 7 years which was a constant learning experience. They were great about putting new job assignments on me in effort to broaden my knowledge of the company from a wider view. Great managers and peers with a hard driving culture.
good,Once you are used to the job it's not bad and the benefits are very good.
good,"Typical day would be setup work environment, check for any defects on equipment, check attendance sheet, management pre-sort meetings, place employees in position and start the conveyor equipment. Check previous day results, hold employees accountable. I've learn a lot about managing an operation, communication is a vital key in executing a plan effectively. Need to be able to rely on your co-workers to get his/her job done in orders for your job to be completed so teamwork is essential."
good,"A typical day at UPS is a very hard day indeed. Delivery of a unkown amount of packages . Getting in and out of the truck constantly, walking of many city blocks . Sometimes you would have to work for very long hours ."
good,"Overall it is an ideal place to work, if you're trying to advance it can be difficult though."
good,Work involed multiple applications within a short period of time. Data quality and management structure were strong and committed to absolute performance quality. team enviroment within union enviroment.
good,overall i enjoy working with different people and learned faster ways to work in the system to get the job done ...safety was the funnest part of all the jobs
good,"Worked all aspects of parcel delivery process. Management was always looking over your shoulder. Co-workers were extreamly competent but very competitive work environment,"
good,"Empresa com empenho em evolução, de ótimos benefícios e estrutura."
good,A great part-time job for college students and for health benefits. Not much opportunity or information available to employees with education and certifications that would qualify them for company-wide employment opportunities.
good,"Driving around delivering packages may sound simple but if your doing it by yourself from 10am to 7pm it will get tiring eventually. This job in my opinion is no different from other work, a job is a job which needs to get done on a daily basis. Its a simple job that I do & I would continue working for this company."
good,"hours too long, fair compensation, room for advancement etc..."
good,"I start my day off site at a customer location to ensure proper distrubition of their product into multiple trailers and timely arrival of these trailers to the UPS property. Once complete, I go to the UPS location and manage the unloading of trailers from multiple customers and UPS local drivers to ensure packages are sorted to proper outbound destinations and service is made on all packages. My job is very fast paced and production driven. I've learned to take initiative and make critical decisions under pressure. UPS has also helped me to identify people's strengths and properly assign people to jobs that best suit them and will be most productive for my operation. My FT Management team gives me a lot of responsibility and expects a lot out of me."
good,"Fast paced job which makes the day go by faster, fun to learn, management was great. The busiest time of the year would be around the holidays, mainly christmas time. I met alot of great people working for UPS."
good,A typical day was filled with chaos. The amount of volume in the hub in a 4 hour period is astronomical. It required advanced choreography by all parties involved in the process of sending parcels to destinations.
good,"Great place to work that is a very physical and will keep you in shape, or if you are looking to get into shape this job will definitely do it for you. Management is great and encourages you to work as team and offers some incentives for doing great work."
good,The best part of this job is the sense of acomplishment after a hard day
good,Everyday was good. I learned a lot about the shipping business. Nothing hard about it.
good,"Data entry and lifting packages, I learned how to work as a team. Management was very minium when it came to the workers. The hardest part was working in a warehouse at all climates. The most enjoyble part was loving what I had become a part of."
good,Mc'donalds I a nice job if you never had one before it was my first job I have every had.
good,Really liked meeting new people and always stayed busy. Sometimes management did not schedule enough people to do a shift. Very strict about being on time for work. If you were late got a ticket.
good,Warehouse duties. Monitored the UPS scanning tracking system for any discrepancies that may occur during the shift and making sure that they are corrected timely manner.
good,A typical day:
good,"the overall company is great, it the different termainals that can sometimes be difficult to deal with. Must have thick skin."
good,"A typical night at UPS was very physical. I learned to memorize numbers faster and which side of the belt the packages needed to be, what hazard materials could not be together in a container and how maximize limited space. Co-workers were willing to help lift heavier packages with each other and jump in to help others that got behind in loading. Management was fair and helpful. Hardest part of the job was working in the heat and staying hydrated. The most enjoyable was meeting new people, learning to work in a fast paced warehouse and staying active."
good,"constant fast pace loading, unloading and sorting of mail semi trucks. late night early morning hours. loud workplace."
good,I enjoyed learning to use data entry hand tool device for scanning mail labels.
good,Its a pretty laid back environment where we work hard and enjoy each others company.
good,ups is a great job to work for the person who is in college and for the already working individual who need extra money and benefits on health care and other beneficial opportunities.
good,"A typical day would be to report in, check the line to see if fully staffed. Call in additional help as needed. Advise crew on day's requirements. Check frequently to see if any problems have arisen or if crew needs assistance. Maintain good communication with team and assist them when needed. Work with management and communicate needs of the workers. The hardest part of the job is letting someone go. This is never done until I have eliminated all options of assisting this employee to perform better. Only a small percentage do not care so I know I do my job well. On the ride home knowing I helped my crew have an easier day, this is the best part of my job."
good,United Parcel Service is a well oiled machine that consists of individuals getting they're work done in a timely fashion while also working as safe as possible.
good,"Great place of employment. People are great to work with, very team oriented. Job security very good and good pay and benefits"
good,"Title says it all, tuition reimbursement is probably the biggest incentive other than the benefits."
good,"Loading trucks in the mornings for the driver's day ahead. Have to place packages in certain order in a very quick manner. Have to be very precise and make sure the packages make it in the correct truck. It is very important to be good with numbers, be in good shape and be ready to work as hard as you can every day."
good,"UPS was a fun fast paced job. the people were cool and the work was only as hard as you made it. its repetitive but it makes the day go by cause you stay busy. though it is hot in the summer and cold in the winter.benefits are good, and they help pay for school."
good,"A typical day at work was to grab a scale and scanner, weight and measure improper packing. I learned that customer can bill themselves and how to work at a fast pace. Management is very devoted and helpful. Co-workers are very friendly and gets alone well. The hardest part is having to carry your scale and scanner everywhere you go cause your responsible for each item if something happens to them. The enjoyable part is actual finding packages that has to audit."
good,societa seria che mi ha dato molto sia nel ambito lavorativo che in quello umano.
good,"loaded and unloaded trucks, package cars and did light house keeping"
good,"I unload packages from the trailers, work with hazmat, learned all of the safety requirements essential for my position, could have better immediate supervisors, my coworkers and i work as a team. The hardest part of the job would be the physical demand, and the time we are given to finish the tasks at hand. Not exactly a very difficult job. Our management will reward, and praise the unloaders for the work completed, we are the backbone of the warehouse."
good,A very good company to be employed. Overall a good company and possibly a place to one day retire from. I welcome the challenges that my work presents.
good,"Driving over the road, long nights majority of driving is at night you are away from home 2 to 3 nights a week."
good,"A typical day at UPS as a driver helper is the driver pickes me up from the Kmart parking lot. we then start our route scanning and carrying packages to businesses and residents. I had a really hard time leaving UPS because everyone is super nice, they treat me like they are my family."
good,"In charge of expediting, customer service, up selling, money handling, & conflict management"
good,Co-workers are great
good,"good company, stable, good benefits, nice managers, very organized for the most part"
good,"ups is a good company to work for fulltime or parttime, and is very demanding"
good,"Great place to work in terms of compensation and stability. However, very demanding and emotionally taxing environment to work in - always focusing on the negative. Tough on family life."
good,Had to unload 54 foot trailers within 45 to 55 minutes. Usually had four trailers for every shift. Learned alot about working with speed and agility. My manager was well organized but had a short temper which taught me to have patience. Hardest part of the job was getting 400 packages unloaded on time by myself. I enjoyed the fact that I was able to work fast was able to respect the value of hard work.
good,"Enjoy working at UPS. Working with workers comp claims, talk with employees and helath care systems."
good,"Every day was busy, I learned how to deal with a union work force."
good,High intensity work environment. Very competitive compensation packages. Excellent holiday and vacation pay.
good,Hardest part of the job is Management. They claim they know everything. An they are not following the UPS procedure rulebook. That's one main reason. I love working with my co workers. We all help one another out when we need help.
good,"One of the greatest things about working for UPS is having the opportunity to interact with such influential leaders in business. The hardest part of the job for most people is the fact that the larger part of our operation is a third shift operation. But more so than that, depending on the department and responsibilities, the hours tend to fluxuate. As management, some days you could come in at 10pm and leave at 8am, others midnight to 6am. It becomes difficult to keep a routine in place. The most enjoyable things about UPS honestly is the people. The emplouees I have the opportunity of working with on a nightly basis, and the ability to watch their growth as a direct result of effecient training."
good,Great environment and great atmosphere. I love to see returning customers and their great attitudes. It always brings a smile to my face.
good,I managed a team of 7 people and was responsible for motivation and discipline. I did paperwork concerning production and planned and led meetings.
good,What you see is what you get; no politics or smoke & mirrors.
good,"I cannot comment because I was a seasonal employee.I worked during the Christmas season, it was not condusive to a break, but that was expected. Heavy customer service, and attention to packaging details for customer satisfaction in fragile items."
good,"Learn data entry and how to measure key strokes per hour with less than 1% error ratio, alpha and numeric. Processed payroll. Making sure anyone received a correct paycheck each week. The hardest part was when it ended. They downsided my job after 16 years."
good,I really like working with honesty and interest.I work Monday to
good,A typical day at work was a back breaking experience. Going from one truck to the other to unload his contents because routine thing. The management maintained a tight shift and instructed the workers fairly. I finally understood how tiresome manual labor could be but I did not regret the experience I received.
good,"Fast pace, ever changing, work. You have a set number of employees to coordinate in your area. In a UPS hub, packages are unload and then loaded again to there specific destinations. My job is to get my team to stay on top of the flow of packages that they are sending from the unload, while keeping the area free of packages. Its a fast pace job, and if you cant motivate and hold your employees accountable; your headed for a downfall."
good,"A typical day working at UPS, you have to be prepared to sweat and get your clothes dirty."
good,"UPS is strong and requires plenty of steps to be taken to move up from Part Time Supervision - years in fact. I would like to see more and faster opportunity to move up, but I do recognize that they are a great company with people who want to stay. I need more than 27.5 hours per week (max) and will continue to search for it!"
good,Great place to work. Hard working people that are like a family. The work ethic is what makes America great.
good,"Typical date at work was answering phones, customer complaints, and assisting drivers with pick-up. Co-workers were easy to work with; hardest part of the job was making sure each client was satisfied; and the enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with drivers and clients."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company,they keep you busy so at the end of the day you actually feel like you accomplished a days work."
good,Fast paced work place. I learned to work with many zip codes of many different states. Management was great. The fast pace of the job was difficult at times. Working with the many co-workers was great.
good,You have to deliver anyting the company ask you too.
good,the company is a great form of employment..very professional and active with customers. this company is very dependable and follows all company guidelines and safety procedures with adequately.
good,Its a safe place to work they main thing is Safety First. You learn different things and meet all kinds of people.
good,"UPS, was an enjoyable organization to work for. This organization was a new step for me, I had never worked for an industrial organization before which made working for UPS a new experience."
good,UPS is a very demanding company to work for. They have been in business for over 100 years and so they have a great work ethic. They understand the transportation industry and logistics.
good,Great Seasonal job. Wish it could've went after the holidays but fun overall.
good,One of best places where i have worked. UPS is easy to get to with local transportation and have great incentives when you are going to school or plan on in the future.
good,Working at the UPS kept you active and focused. It teaches you great teamwork!
good,"Great wage and benefit package for someone starting out in the work force. Great part time job for student, or someone seeking second opportunity."
good,Great environment for goal orientated persons. UPS is very customer orientated and ensures that all personel both hourly and management always focus on the customer satisfaction first and foremost.
good,One of the better franchises to own. Owner franchisee has some latitude to manage their own individual store(s) to accomodate their regional area needs.
good,"I have been there for 11 years, i enjoy working there except for the fact i have part time the entire time i been working there, It is hard to get a full time postion."
good,"Ups was a great place to work at while i was in high school,it set values wish have helped me better my work ethics in my future,such things as to always be on time to work as well as wear the right work atire."
good,I loved working with the people on my posi but the job requirements range from minimum effort to all physical energy (depending on where you're placed).
good,The job has decent pay reasonable pay and teaches you allot about representation. Doing what is expected of you is at a high expectation which is expected being on time is mandatory more than most jobs which is good .
good,"If you're competent, responsible, and punctual, you will be well rewarded for these qualities. Stay on your toes and follow all the rules. The smaller the center you work from, the less concern they'll impose about needless aforementioned "
good,"Good pay, good benefits. Horrible management. Annual raise. Education assistance. Not great hours depending on position. Hours vary from 4 hours a day to 6 hours a day."
good,management sucks and they dont care about your well-being as long as the work gets done no care is really given too much from my time of working there.
good,Ups was a great experience. Got to see alot of san antonio& different people everyday. Or repeat customers getting to know them as time goes on. Fast paced deliveries it's like getting paid to excercise
good,Besides freezing getting on and off the truck UPS is a pretty good job. Pays good for the hours even though can be limited hours. Once you start working though pretty easy thing to Get a hold of just taking the package to and from the buildings.
good,AthoughI was a seasonal driver's helper.I very much enjoyed working with Brian Jurdak out of Brewer Maine location.We developed an effective delivery system that worked for both of us.It would be a dream job for me to have if I was afforded the opportunity.
good,Worked around home life good pay co works are team works great job. Managers really don’t care about staff union never came when they were called I didn’t get paid for two week in a row.
good,"a typical day is preparing equipment for delivery, loading freight trucks when they arrive.  Being able to pack a truck efficiently and make sure all protocols are followed by receiving and checking in material by processing all incoming materials."
good,"So far, I have worked for UPS for a little over 2 years. The job is fun, and the people there are nice. However, the hours currently are subpar. We go in about 4 AM until about 930 AM. So, roughly 5 hours. I recommend going into UPS as a driver or supervisor. Package Handlers are overstaffed as it is."
good,This store was managed and owned by a father and son. They were the most grumpy people I ever met. They would only be nice to the people that were spending money. I don't feel that was right of them to be able to treat the public the way they did. I enjoyed helping people with the computers and printers even helping people with shipping things.  I would have enjoyed that job if the management wasn't so rude. The son use to say he will make money anyway because Stapples wouldn't be able to build one with in 5 miles of that ups store. That is not right for someone to think that way. I did enjoy the work itself though.
good,"This is a good job with great benefits and pay. The one thing that’s tough for me is start times being so late. This makes for some late nights, but If you enjoy the fast paced outdoor side it’s not too bad."
good,Detailed oriented and methodical daily routines that demand good time management skills. Fast paced and calculated personal strategies must be formed in order to be consistently successful each day. Management is driven directly from the upper levels down the ladder. There is a team atmosphere and culture that's good. I enjoyed getting the packages to the customers who were always glad to see you. Not a bad place to work at all. The key is getting the proper rest and eating and drinking the right things to perform your best each day. The training for me was the hardest part from the start the first week at a special facility. You have to pass the initial training there first before going any further. It was like a training boot camp with lots of computer training modules and a strong emphasis on safety which helps you get the big picture and really focus.
good,"Working at UPS was exactly like everyone assumes it would be. Not very social, although when there is a break in between when trucks arrive and depart, coworkers were friendly. Kind of a 'brainless' job where it did not require a lot of thinking, although it can require physical strain."
good,"Part-time sups work hard, hard to get a full time position, short staffed and some drivers and package handlers have a large entitlement attitude. Fantastic tuition reimbursement program, works with their employees when they have life events that they need time off for. Overall, not a bad company to work for, if I could have found a full-time position with the company after I graduated I would have stayed. Union is the way to go at UPS, management is not  Union"
good,I think the only part of the job to be challenged is that you must stay hydrated to keep moving. when you're slowing down co-workers help each other and great conversations while working.
good,The workers are very well compensated for the job that is done. The benefits are the best that I have ever seen in the industry. Management is amazing and the company truly is safety first.
good,"Great job with plenty of opportunities for advancement.  Competitive compensation package and great benefits, great people to work with and management team that values you as an individual"
good,When you work at UPS you work hard. You get paid well for doing a good job. The benefits are good. It is very sense of urgency atmosphere. Don't go there unless you want to be a team player. Overall a good company.
good,"As a package handler, this position can be very challenging mostly during peak season and holidays. It was fun for the most, but you have to be physically prepared and get a lot of sleep."
good,".real, educational, fast pace, and co-workers supportive n helpful.  See the country side,meet the neighbors and enjoying working independently. A challenging job with mother nature, number of packages,stops and finding address numbers on mailboxes. Cell phone finding dead areas making GPS and scanning packages interesting. A fun gig while it lasted."
good,They have great management but their communication is not great. I worked there for over a month and not one time have I received a call from them telling me we are working or anything. They want you to go to their location and check the schedule
good,They are very consistent. The work is steady and the pay is weekly. There are benifits that are available after a certain amount of time. It is not a climate controlled environment.
good,"The communication wasn't great at first.  I sometimes didn't know when I was going to work or be needed.  By the end of my time with them, they communicated at the beginning of each day, if I would have a route.  I was in charge of my own route so it was kind of like working for myself.  I had supervisors, but I was on my own."
good,"As a shifter, you are assigned a tug. A small vehicle, of which, pulls containers to and from a air craft. That's it. Plus you are outside, not inside. Which is something I have always looked for in a job. That's my favorite part of working there"
good,If you are attending college then I highly recommend this job. Flexible work hour on top of tuition reimbursement is a nice positive to go with any future college grad.
good,"My Manager Very Helpful. Proved that you ""get what you give"". He left no question unanswered. "
good,"good job but it was cold. loved the pace of the job and most managers were very nice and understanding. Could ask questions if need be and not feel silly,"
good,"Working as a package handler required speed, strength, and focus. Not everyone would be able to keep up with your work paste nor feel the need to work hard so depend on yourself and your supervisors. Learn about working your way up the ranks and be a role model to others."
good,"This company has a strong work ethics and they take their brand seriously."
good,Supervisor is very uncoordinated with giving time and location of work and  quantity of packages and stops. Also Supervisor is unprofessional in communication when appropriately communicating to employee's.
good,I didn't feel as though I was treated unfairly and the workers there treated me with the upmost respect. I would work there again if given the opportunity again
good,"I retired January 3, 2020. I worked there since 1990. Good company to work for. Good pay and benefits. I was co-chair of UPS safety committee for 12 years."
good,Scheduled deliveries on a daily basis. Work until your package car is empty. This means that your day does not end until late at night. Working on Saturday is often required.
good,"The hardest part was the uncertainty. "
good,Good pay but a lot of labor teaches you to be responsible and on time for work. Not a lot of hours but good pay per hour and ups have slot of benefits.
good,I worked as a driver helper temporarily... you are on call and it is very important that you build a relationship with every driver you work with as they decide daily if you work..it can be stressful not knowing if you will receive work..most days you only work about 4 hours
good,"I liked my time at ups, they really made every one hustle, it was a great work out and a lot of realization that you can do anything you put your mind to. Some managers were definitely better at being managers than others, but that can be related to any job."
good,"Good company to work for and job always keeps you busy. Good thing about this job is you are always on the move so it makes your day go by faster. Lots of interaction with customers, so if you are not a people person than this might not be the job for you."
good,i loved it here. just be cautious when it come to a injury didn't handle that very well. no heat or ac so be prepared to sweat. its an all around great place to work.
good,"I have been enjoying my time working at UPS. I enjoy being able to be physically active while getting paid for it. It is tiring, hard work that pays off. I recommend it for anyone who needs a part time job that is both flexible and rewarding."
good,i very munched enjoyed my employment it was very good for team building and was a good foundation for hard work. with this knowledge i feel i can go anywhere and adapt to a fast paced work environment
good,UPS was a great company to work for and I am going to pursue a career with them after the holidays.  UPS pays their drivers very well and is considered one of the highest paying careers without a college degree.
good,"Very friendly environment.. Job security, and opportunity to advance in the company.. UPS has a very high standard when it comes to providing excellent customer service"
good,I like working for UPS for the flexibility of hours. Management is great when i need to switch a day and the pay and benefits are good. Most days are stress free but peak season is rough
good,"Where else can you work part time and receive full medical, dental and vision benefits for no charge for you and your family.  The Benefits, 401k, Pension and shift options make it a great option for those that need to find something with benefit."
good,Very productive and fast paced environment. Always pushing to do better no matter how good or bad the situation is. Getting the job done quickly and accurately.
good,"Working here I actually learned a lot. Ranging from how to package items, shipping guidelines and also stuff pertaining to USPS since the UPS store works with the post office. My pay was alright.. Not enough in my opinion. And also if you’re looking for the UPS benefits forget about it. UPS stores are a franchise and do not offer benefits.. Only the actual UPS company does. Overall not a bad place to work at but the pay just wasn’t enough"
good,"The work environment was a forever changing space. One day the entire building is full of charisma, the next sluggish. I learned to develop my people skills."
good,"•	Separate and organize packages according to address"
good,"Paid fairly, extreme weather conditions but compensated for it.  Chance to move to inside warehouse worker takes long to move up into another position."
good,If you want to get in shape and get paid for it then being a UPS Package Handler is the job for you. Work culture is okay everyone I work with is friendly. The manager's I worked with emphasize getting every package in the trailer in an orderly fashion. Although I stress that this job is HIGHLY fast pace and you will - at most times be overwhelmed by the volume of packages.
good,"The best thing about working at UPS is the pay and benefits. There is a down side....they work a lot of hours! If your a hard worker and do not have an attendance issue, you will do well at UPS."
good,it was a good job very fast paced was really one of my first jobs a lot of work learned a lot from the company I learned how to do a lot of things that carried over to my life after ups the bad was really the management really never communicated with u your kinda on your own
good,I’m more of a warehouse worker and that’s what I’ve been looking for it feels as if I’m going to work out and I work out a lot I play a lot of sports.
good,You are given a lot of training to utilize all of the companies resources and it comes in handy as you have a variety of clients with different requests.
good,"My typical day starts by setting up the scanners and load charts for the hourlies (loaders).  Next, I coordinate with the dispatch supervisors any routes they are adding or taking off the dock.  I will then communicate the information provided by the dispatch supervisors to the loaders on the dock.  This process of communication between the loaders, myself, and the dispatch supervisors continues throughout the day until the time the drivers are dispatched on road.  Another important aspect of the job is identifying who needs additional help to wrap up their load.  If help is needed, I will let my boss know, see he can secure additional help from elsewhere in the building."
good,Its not difficult. Just keep a nice consistent pace with some problem solving skills and you should be liked quite easily and even be considered to be promoted to supervisor or more.
good,"UPS is a career job, it take time and patients to move up. There is great opportunity’s to become a full time Driver and make a very good living, also the medical benefits are fantastic. Warehouse jobs are all PT but come with full medical benefit."
good,"I applied for full time.(hoping to work there while going to school) ended up being only seasonal. Got paid weekly, and always made over time. Wish I got to stay longer. If given the opportunity I would go back and work for them."
good,"Solid pay, great benefits"
good,My coworkers were awesome. Also the customers were really great and super nice. My boss was a good man. Most I truly enjoyed assisting our customers. I enjoyed the work hours. Truly a good place to work the atmosphere was friendly.
good,"Fortune 500 with 2 corporate offices in Atlanta. Got a promotion within 9 months. Fast track growth if your motivated, smart, hardworking and network. With rising competition they value innovation. Not my favorite culture; they operate in a military like hierarchy with emphasis on the chain of command which I think holds them back and is extremely antiquated."
good,"Quick moving shift, fast pace, problem solving, and critical thinking. Challenging place to work and must be a fast learner and quick thinker. Overall good employer but must figure out if it works with your scheduling as well."
good,Management has a open door policy and they are very professional.  The company offers a lot of  training opportunities to improve your current skills or learning new skills.
good,Yes it was very fast paced but it was fun. You always compete with you friends there to see who was quicker and more efficient. It was just a great time working there.
good,"A typical day at UPS is very fast passed, you need to stay focused at all time.  I worked with a lot a different people and learned a lot from all.  The position was for parttime and now I need to find a full time position."
good,As a new hire I am not really sure what I need to say in this spot.  I have been welcomed with open arms and being helped to be a productive employee.
good,From experience ups is an extremely face paced work force. You can expect to be needing water 75% of the time when you end your shift but other than that the job is fairly easy and manageable if you can keep up a steady pace.
good,It was fast paced but easy work. There are guaranteed hours. My only complaint is not a long enough lunch break. We get one lunch break out of an eight hour period
good,"There are many constantly moving parts inside UPS's operations.  Starting out as a package handler is undoubtedly hard work, however once you understand the job methods, it becomes easier.  The benefit package is great at UPS, to include health and dental for a small union dues fee, in addition to tuition reimbursement for a lifetime of $25,000, so it is a great part time job for college students.  What I truly respect about UPS is their practice of promoting from within.  Supervisory positions may become available to employees as soon as their 31st working day."
good,"Ups was a very fast paced environment on certain days and times so you have to keep up, everyone there is nice and respectful i would work there again."
good,It’s cool you gotta work hard and don’t talk and kinda be a robot but if you do that skies the limit. Managers are kind of out for their own numbers so you can only work hard and be better for yourself.
good,"The warehousing side of UPS is very demanding. Production really ramps up in the months surrounding the holidays and end of month, but it's busy all year. There's hardly time to catch up on any of the little things that need to get taken care of or considered for safety when the quotas are so high that you have to slave to even reach them.."
good,"I was surrounded by supervisors and mangers that were passionate about doing the job well. Sure there was stress and frustration but, it came from a place of passion and wanting to take pride in the work you have accomplished. There are a lot of moving parts, and it takes skill, time, and dedication to get it right. If you want to take it easy and stare at a screen all day this isn't for you. You will be moving constantly, making decisions, and executing plans. The best part that I loved was the brotherhood, or togetherness my fellow supervisors and I had with each other. We had each others backs both at work and outside of work. I can't say that will be everyone's exact experience but, it was mine and it's a culture that is supported in my opinion."
good,"UPS was a very good job to have. The benefits were great, the management was tolerable, but the best part about it is the oppurtunity to actually move up and get paid. It is hard manual labor but for most guys I don't think it's a problem."
good,"Great pay, Monday thru Friday with great benefits and pension. company supplies uniforms. Excellent medical plan. This is a very physical job. I would recommend this job."
good,"UPS was a very good job to have. The benefits were great, the management was tolerable, but the best part about it is the oppurtunity to actually move up and get paid. It is hard manual labor but for most guys I don't think it's a problem."
good,"Working at UPS is both frustrating and rewarding. It's a fast paced physical work environment that can be overwhelming for new hires. The main draw is their benefits. The best insurance you'll ever have after a year and immediate tuition reimbursement for school. If you have a plan to go to school, become a driver, use it for insurance, move up, etc. It'll be worth it and manageable. If you're looking for a stand alone job, it will be miserable."
good,"If you are in college and don't have a way to pay for it, then UPS is the way to go. Tuition reimbursement, and an easy slow paced job. The job is boring, and the supervisors think they have more power than they do, but as long as you read the handbook nobody can abuse you."
good,"UPS has done nothing but good for me as long as I’ve been working here, great staff, great people. Supervisors are very flexible w you. Lots of hard work, will not tolerate laziness"
good,"Very easy to get a job here; just be reliable and be able to lift 50 lbs.  No set hours - your day is over when the work is done.  Gives mandatory, paid lunch breaks.  Sometimes have to work in inclimate weather."
good,"Working with others in the diverse environment at ups is a fast paced job, where you have to stay focused and on your feet and work well with others. A great place to gain experience in warehouse work as a package handler."
good,"not to bad of management in the workplace, i was taught all of the safety procedures and protocols, hardest part of the job was waking up at 2 in the morning to get to work at 3:30. Most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends."
good,I would recommend this job to whom ever would love to move around without watching to make your day slow as possible. It's a fun environmental job that a lot of employees would love to have.
good,"-Long hours "
good,"Great place to work if you are interested in physical activity. Very personal job , you don't have to interact with anyone. Great for someone who is independent."
good,"Overall experience at UPS has been great. Plenty of opportunities to be taken advantage of. I am currently a operational supervisor, managing day to day activities."
good,"The start at Ups was excellent. Start pay for High Value Administrator was 17.60. Plus a raise once a year. In my second year payroll changed drastically where .5 hours per day was taken from me. So instead of 25 hrs per. week. Now only receive 22.5 hrs. per week, plus first year was granting overtime at least 4 times a year. Now In my second year no overtime has been given. This is why I'm seeking employment. Now I'm unable to maintain the cost of living expenses. My yearly pay is decreased by at least 5K."
good,Plane is usually late from the Hub. This causes lots of stress. People are nice and administrative position is in a controlled environment. Baby it's cold outside and forget about getting time off from before Thanksgiving until after Christmas. Overtime for sure.
good,"It was a good job because of all the benefits that you receive. however, the pay was not high enough for all the work that we did and the weather that we had to deal with. Worked outside through snow, rain, cold, hot it did not matter."
good,"My boss was nice, happy environment. I have wonderful references.  I would box fertile items. Would check on damage cases. Distribute the mail, we had personal mail boxes there."
good,Ups was a great job. It was a fast- paced kind of job but it was a good paying job. Most of the time i am in a truck scanning boxes and stacking then like a wall so that they do not fall or tip over when the truck pulls off. I make around 13 to 20 walls in a truck.
good,"A hard company to work for,very fast paced but robust and tight internal process makes change slow, very good pay,long,long hours,working away from home a lot"
good,"A typical day at Ups was hardworking. I learned that you must be mentally prepared for work more than physically, sometimes. Management was the best it could be."
good,"Being a UPS driver has its benefits of great pay and benefits, plus a pension after 20 years, but with the level of growing shipping orders, the company is struggling to hire. Drivers have been working around 50-55 hours per week in the summer."
good,"Always looking for people for either the Air Ramp or Sorting packages.  Work an average of 15 - 20 hours per week.  Supervisors are great, howver some employees try to circomvent their authority."
good,"Very hard and fast-paced job, if it were full-time it would be better simply because of starting pay for a job that requires very little skill. As time goes on and you get more senority your job can get easier with higher pay."
good,UPS is a great place to work if you like the feeling of a job accomplished each day.  Each day you can be responsible for getting thousands of packages out to consumers and making sure you help get it done in a timely matter.
good,"Fast-paced environment. Very busy with different tasks between faxing, printing, packaging, shipping and notary service.  Management is great.  Pay for the work load is to minimal."
good,If you aren’t fit this job isn’t suitable for you. You have to be prepared to lift and move quickly.When you first start it will be tough for you but you will get used to the work and fit in perfectly.
good,UPS was very unorganized but did not fire people. The work load put with the breaks giving isn't equal. Working as a loader at UPS for any long stint of time would cause physical damage to the body.
good,It's cool working there. It's  a very physical job. Its a hit and miss with how work will be day to day. Some days it's slow other days you feel its never going to end. It's very hot in the warehouse. You have to have water or something to drink. Ups goes by seniority so don't expect to move up fast. A lot of people there have 20+ years there. Overall I enjoy the job.
good,"Helping the driver organize and get ready for the next neighborhood. Delivering packages to the customers door, ensuring the package is in a safe place."
good,"Because UPS Stores are a franchise, they are all owned by members of the community. The owner of my store is a wonderful person, and she was a good boss. She created a great work culture, and I would have stayed under different circumstances."
good,"If you are looking for a stable job and benefits , this is the job for you. The benefits are great and they’ll pay for you to go to school. Make sure that you go to the main source with your problems"
good,Good amount of work. Sometimes employees were a bit over the top but the work got done. Something new to get done everyday. Coworkers would assist you. Some of them have an attitude but that is normal.
good,"Long hours and hard work but the atmosphere from management made the day easier. WILL start as a package handler unless you have previous qualifications as a fork lift operator and such. Safe environment, never felt like others were not aware of the risk involved in working in a warehouse environment and management made sure to keep it on our minds. At the location I worked (Little Rock,AR) they were very forgiving for making mistakes while you are learning, they understand its a trial by fire type of thing and people will get burnt. Also even though Package Handlers don't have a lot of time to communicate with one another you still feel like you are working as a team and everything is a team effort."
good,I had a good experience at UPS for 5 years.  I put in my sweat and tears but it all worked out.  The benefits are excellent.  You have to be dedicated and a hard worker to handle it.
good,"UPS provides a good environment for hard workers. If you are dedicated, you will excell, and management takes notice of outstanding employees. Great company to work for."
good,"It pays really well if you are starting out as a temporary driver helper. You must learn quickly how to properly deliver packages to the homes of others. There is a chance you could become a driver yourself if you decide to stick with UPS for awhile, I recommend it because the rewards can be reaped. Paid more than I thought it would for someone who only worked there for one day."
good,Overall decent environment for a first job. I felt overworked and pressured at times but not real disciplinary action was taken on those who were trying there best.
good,The managers there are very friendly and supportive. I enjoyed my time working there getting to know the ends and outs of sending off packages. I loved doing print jobs for customers.
good,My time working for Ups was none other than great. My experience with my co-workers is fantastic and the communication i've had with them is great. The management their is not to bad. Communication between can get lost but they uplift us to do better and strive for better.
good,UPS requires a firm dedication to be successful at the company both in management and employees. If you enjoying being active at work this is for you.
good,I have done everything at ups. From unloading trucks to loading trucks.  Sorting. 54ft trucks to the car trucks. I did drivers a few times work over time. To get packages out on time.
good,"Working at a UPS Store, being separate from the main corporation, I can't say much because I only worked as a temp for one Christmas in 2011. The store I work at itself is a good place with a great owner whom I've gotten to know over the past 5 years."
good,"Company is very concerned with micro managing. Phone time is priority. Sales numbers aren't as important. Job turnover is an issue. Work conditions are okay, not something that would be considered a plus."
good,I must say it was a hard working group. And the bosses where nice and if any problems came up we all worked to make the problems work. Overall a great place to work at.
good,hands on labor work with a fast work pace and lifting and lowering boxes. worked in a warehouse with trucks and employees loaded and unloaded those trucks to prepare for the drivers in the morning to deliver.
good,"The task wasn't too hard to handle after getting a handle on the job."
good,The employees and managers were very helpful in letting the new hires knowing what to do and how to keep us busy. It was a bit fast-paced but very easy to know what to do in an efficient manner.
good,The driver was very helpful in job training during our time on the truck. Every year this company has a seasonal period where they hire driver helpers to help with extreme loads during this period.
good,many days had different entering time once we got to work the manger would be out there to see what time we get there and they would say hi once we got inside we had to scan our cards to see how many hours we are going to work for. Then we would get into our loading trucks with our water bottles because in those trucks it would be hot. we all had to have machines with us to scan the packages to make sure they are in the right place. Red might it does nor belong and green might its in the right place.  it was a stressful job just because there was so many boxes coming down the machine and if you were not fast those boxes were falling down every where and they would tell you to hurry up but if you were struggling they would seed someone to help you and that was basically what I had to do.
good,"Great Company to work for.  It is a very fast pace company with long hours. They pay is great, but if you value time more than money then may not be the job for you."
good,Every day have a scope to learn new things on ups.Reqire to travel extensively. Patience is the key factor to achieve the success.Should be polite in nature.
good,Great for getting exercise and if u need to get college done. The managers and supervisors are very lenient but not to the point of letting anything happen.
good,I find ups a good job for those who wants to begin a career from bottom to top. It takes time for the growth and dedication.but if you're looking for high pay rates right away I wouldn't recommend it.
good,"A typical day at UPS as a preloader involves lots of packages!  The Sheboygan facility handles a minimum of 11,000 packages per preload.  Preloaders handle 1-4 package cars during a 4-5 hour shift (150-1200 packages), some up to 150 lbs.  Shifts start around 4 am, M-F, No Weekends (off-peak) and last to 9 am, when the drivers head out to deliver.  Management varies depending on where you are working in the facility.  Being a union shop, there are clear lines between management and union workers, which is a good thing.  Clear job responsibilities.  The hardest part of the job is knowing when to ask for help.  Since you can't predict what speed, size or weight packages any one car will get each day, you have to be prepared for everything, that means getting enough sleep, water, and nourishment the day prior to and during shift.  Asking for help when you get buried in packages is key to success, because you will get buried!  Staying organized and knowing your load sheets is also key.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you loaded the package car to the best of your ability at the end of the day.  Feedback from the drivers is helpful to make your next load better.   You are allowed to keep your phone on you during shift, so you can listen to an audiobook or your choice of music, with one earbud. Preloaders have health, dental, vision, vacation/personal days.  It's a great part-time gig, if you like early morning work.  It's important to be on time, know where you need to be and be ready to start prior to shift."
good,Was a clerk first. then switched to unload. to progress my self to a manager position after I have completed my one year. Also good with computers and completed all quizzes  and training Modules
good,Fast pace always something to be done. One of the few things I loved about UPS.Working in triple digits weather no climate control was the most hardest
good,Working at UPS is a good experience but the labor was too much for me personally. The benefits they give are good but I don't think it's worth the pain that you have to go through.
good,Start off helping out the dockworkers load your trailer for your daily route. Pre-trip your truck and trailer then hookup to your trailer and get ready for your day
good,"Its an excellent job, you have to be mentally strong with though skin to work in a high demanding stressful environment. They offer excellent benefits & theres room for growth."
good,"UPS is a good job, for the right person, I feel like it just wasn’t the job for me with The high pace they wanted you to keep up with boxes that was bigger then me"
good,"I held 2 positions at UPS. The first was physical examination processing for health exams and respiratory exams throughout the company whose position required one. The exams were protocoled and any missing information was obtained before the exam could be completed and sent to the Health Examiner."
good,To new employees there is one thing that is for certain. You will work very hard but if you move around and learn other positions you can make a career out of it.
good,productive and fast paced workplace.Gives you a workout like being at an gym.People are friendly and willing to help out.Environment can vary from weather outside
good,I was the owner of this franchise and it was fun and very good for me i had some of my family working for me and was the assistant the reason i sold is because i just wanted to retire and go part time
good,"Ok place to work but super hot in the summer, the hardest part of the job is when people call out and you have to do more than one person’s job or some lazy people not wanting to do their job"
good,"You will be loading multiple trucks, there will be very minimal downtime and it is quite hot. The pay can be worth it especially since the times are not during most normal work hours, so if you need a side hustle it can be beneficial."
good,"Die Leute sind sehr Nett, helfen mit wenn man mal nicht weiter weiß und falls man etwas nicht versteht kann man nachfragen und es wird einen in ruhe erklärt."
good,I liked my job  hated few people and worked hard in the end I left for a better career opportunity but all in all they are a great company I will say they play favorites and one person will drill you for something that millions of others do. So watch out for that but that aside they do give management  great pay and benefits but they do not treat them the same as the drivers who can do whatever they want with no consequences.
good,"Fast paced job including a lot of heavy lifting, work was none stop. Hardest part was keeping up with packages or over flowing with work, over all great people and teams"
good,"Decent holiday season job, very physical. Hours can be very unpredictable, but generally increase as you get closer to Christmas.The app they used for clocking in/out as well as confirming package deliveries frequently messed up, even resulting in my hours being shortchanged a couple times, so keep you eyes out for that."
good,"No benefits for seasonal drivers but if you can get hired on full time after one or two seasonal periods you will have a chance at benefits. The job is extremely easy just drive, drop and hook. I was told the job paid $30 an hour but found out they recently changed the seasonal pay to $21 an hour. Still nothing to cry about. You’ll be on call even if after the seasonal period you do get hired full time for about the first 2 to 3 years which isn’t terrible if you’re single with no kids but otherwise can be stressful not knowing when they’ll need you. This also makes your paychecks unpredictable. The good news is that if you get hired full time you get free medical for you and family and overtime pay after 8 hours not 40. So even if you work only 1 day in a week but you work 10 hours you get paid for 2 hours of overtime pay which is the way it’s supposed to be. Also current top rate after 4 years is $37.06 hour. The new contract increases that to $40.51 hour starting August 2022. Those 2 numbers coupled with the free medical insurance are what brought me there but I left because of the night shift hours and being on call. But for the guys that have been there a while that’s a ton of money."
good,"I enjoyed my time there and was looking forward to staying there permanently, regretfully, my car broke down and transportation to and from work became a real issue."
good,I was trained to help the driver. So I would run packages to the door. I had an awesome driver who was funny and made me feel comfortable! I absolutely loved working for UPS.
good,"UPS was my chance to get back into the workforce and I like the opportunity to work here as a supervisor. There is a rough work culture in the operations side of the company but if you have been in the military you will probably feel right at home. They hire from inside and help with promotions. If you work hard and stick around you will get promoted, just don't get to caught up with the drama and find a way to relax after work."
good,Prepare yourself for hard work performance in a short amount of time. You will want to prepare with a good nights sleep and healthy eating for the physical demanding job.
good,"The culture of the brokerage office is very laid back, diverse, comfortable, like a family. I learned how to assign tariffs to imports using the HTSUS. Managers are for the most part personable, fair, and eager to help. The hardest part of the job is the few and far between upset customers, the process of accruing discretionary time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of learning so many new things daily, and being able to work in an environment where most people are like family."
good,"Sorting and organizing boxes to their correct area."
good,"Alright Job. Had a good environment. It was just boring, and not something i would be interested in doing for the rest of my life. This is all i have to say about it."
good,"For a new person, UPS may seem a tad harsh. Your body aches and you're constantly hoping for a lucky break, however as time goes on it does get easier. As an unloader, I developed bonds with some of my co-workers, not necessarily my fellow unloaders but rather the sorters down the conveyor belt. Without them, you can not do your job and they are unable to do theirs without you. You slowly start to learn their quirks, how fast they can go, and their limits. There were sometimes that my sorters simply left the aisle without telling anyone, this is naturally slow you down a bit. I have been yelled at a couple of times for not clearing out trailers in a hasty fashion due to this little annoyance but any problems go away once I explain the situation. I would recommend working here as it is easy enough to progress up the rankings but living off of the pay I got while employed here did not make it worth while for the long haul. Since they raised the pay, I am actually debating on returning back there. Not sure if they will take me back as I left to deal with mental health issues. But I would gladly go back to square one if I could."
good,"A typical day at work would include either loading or unloading trailers, depending on which department you are placed in."
good,I work at a fast paced environment. I have to be there daily. I have to wear the proper foot wear and clothing to work. It is inside with no air conditioning.
good,"Good place close to home. Family oriented, caring management. Great retirement and medical benefits. Christmas season means extra work and big paychecks."
good,Sometimes it rough for me I am a professional person & it's not professional at some times.  There is a huge lack of communication & I tend to compare it to my previous employers
good,"A typical day in my position on an outbound belt is very difficult. From the beginning of my shift to the end, I almost always have at least one package in my hand(s)."
good,"Overall, great company to work for."
good,"Working at ups is pretty laid back, you make a lot of friends and can enjoy your time there even when it gets a little more stressful. The benefits are great however having to wait 9 months is a little ridiculous."
good,"A good job for some extra money. You only know if you’re working the day of, and if you don’t respond fast enough someone else works instead of you. Some of the boxes are heavy so if you’re weak you may not be able to carry them all. You must be comfortable on your feet because it’s very fast paced and you’ll be running the boxes back and forth repeatedly. I wouldn’t recommend if you have bad knees. The drivers are usually very nice but aren’t allowed to request helpers anymore so you get a different one each time usually."
good,UPS is a high intensity work environment. No matter what your position is at UPS your consistently busy. There is always a lot going on and sometimes can feel overwhelming.
good,"UPS Freight is a great place to turn wrenches, especially for a beginner looking to gain experience.  They will hire kids right out of school, or old timers looking for a fresh start.  Except for emergency breakdowns or drivers needing quick repairs, management doesn't stress you out.  They rarely look over your back, and ask for ETAs. They realize things happen, not everything goes as planned, and know how long some jobs can take. If you're honest with them, and respect them and the equipment, they will be good to you. Highly recommended, especially for you young guys trying to get your feet wet."
good,"I enjoyed working for my supervisior, he was a great boss and was always playful and fun. The job came easily to me and therefore I enjoyed the work and the environment."
good,It’s ok not a bad job it’s fun and you’ll get a good pay if you can get a a lot of hours but you’ll have to stay for a while because everything goes by sonority so the people that have been there longer will get first priority
good,"A typical day at UPS includes a lot of heavy lifting. I learned to be aware of changing conditions, it is wise to be cross-trained to become a bigger value to the company. The management is variable. If your manager/supervisor is nice and easygoing you won't have any problems. But if the situation is the other way around then there will be a large problem. The workplace culture is very nice, the people is what keeps most people there. The hardest part of the job is the job itself. Heavy flow of boxes 40k - 100k depending on the time of year. And since they are so determined to make production they slam it down our throats. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and how it resembles a sport."
good,"The UPS Store was a good place to work as a college student, but I did not receive benefits and there was not much room for growth. Again, it probably varies from owner to owner, since they are independent franchises."
good,I've enjoyed my time here. Patience is a must if you are to work in customer service. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with unruly or rude people.
good,Typical day was fine from day to day. I was brought on and trained day to day for a week in order to learn the ropes. There was a set quota that each loader was required to do while loading freight onto delivery trucks. Promotions are normally reserved for the best loaders and the best part is the pay increases. The down side is there is a rift between management and loaders. Loaders are in the union and supervisors are not. Employees always had words with management if they were feeling harassed at work over being asked to do their job.
good,On a typical day at work upon arrival I clock in and then go upstairs to my work area which is small sort. I am usually greeted by some managers at the door saying hello and informing me on the work for the night which is comforting. It is a very fast paced work environment which can be difficult and stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other employees. This makes the night go by quicker.
good,"A typical day at the UPS Store included weighing customer's packaging contents, determining the best shipping materials and cost, listening to the customer complain about the high shipping cost,  giving customer their change and their tracking number, then going to the back of the store to pack the contents into the selected container and wait for the UPS driver to pick it up that evening. I also learned how to laminate, take passport photos, fax, copy, scan, enlarge or shrink documents, print, and bind. "
good,I worked at ups in louisville ky. I went there because there was a program that allowed me work there and go to school for free. So I took that opportunity and ran with it. It was fast paced but it was not overwhelming. It was $10 an hr. I  think they should give temp a raise because it wasnt easy to pay for everything is need for home and school with $200 a week. I could never save money.
good,"Owners were very understanding of work life balance. Corporate office not really in touch with owners and individual stores. Corporate doesn't really know how the stores should be run and what stores need in order to be successful. Overall great place to work, however, corporate office has too many requirements and doesnt understand everyday processes and struggles in the store."
good,Unload and load packages from truck to truck.scan packages as well. The reason why I left is because I was only working 2or 3 hours a night and I couldn’t afford to drive 45 min just to work 3 hrs. I did all the positions there and I would have stayed if I had more hours but that didn’t happen.
good,Would like to work there again pay is OK and the people that were working there when I was working was there to help each other and worked together as one
good,"This was my very first job and I LOVED it. What made me love it was because of my awesome supervisor. They were very polite, respectful, and cared if we felt like we we're being ""Over Worked"". Early on, it made me appreciate other people who experiences hard labor jobs. If you're in the Louisville area and want money to go to college, I HIGHLY recommend you going to UPS, they will pay FULL Tuition to U of L or JCTC, but you have to work 3rd shift."
good,"I enjoy working for the company. I do nit intend to leave. This will be the company I retire from. Aside from the equipment provided being garbage, easy steady work. As Long as you stay moving and do your job, time flies."
good,"The job was fast paced, demanding hours because it was from about 3am- whenever finished. Which is the con in this job because you usually would only rake in about 5 hours a day. So if you want to work full time, this isn't the place for you."
good,I enjoyed working at UPS Freight up until the day I was laid off. Learned and owe UPS the honor of my success today . It was a pleasant and great company to work for with great benefits.
good,"UPS offers a variety of opportunities, every day comes with its own set of challenges and rewards. Flexibility is an attribute you need to possess.  The company is an excellent place to learn and grow. You get out of your day what you put into it."
good,"Worked as feeder driver since 1995, retired with pension & health benefits for 10 years! Copy?Don't want to tell you my whole work history!  "
good,The daily experience while working at UPS was that I learned a many things about how to sort mail and pack packages. Getting to know the customers was very nice. Most of them were friendly. The atmosphere in the store was generally pleasant.
good,"work in UPS,  Newark airport, The day starts very early, some very heavy days others more simple. the workmates very good person."
good,As most people probably know about the UPS is that its Union. They treat everyone the same and there are scheduled raises based on years served. Anyone can make good money here if they put in the years. Promotions are on a first come first serve basis and who has worked the longest at the time of the job opening.
good,I had to get acclimated to the physical aspect of the job and transitioning to other positions so quickly but found that every new position was just a part of warehouse employment....
good,Extremely fast paced environment with new challenges each day. Requires above average stamina and physicality due to increasing workload as more people turn to online shopping.
good,UPS will keep your body in the shape and will give you good salary and excellent retirement benefits. They will also make sure you work for it.  You will meet lots of people.
good,"I enjoy working here and having the opportunity to complete different tasks. I wish that the environment was better and that the supervisors and managers especially treated everyone with more respect.  Also, we need to work as a team more instead of disconnecting with each other and try to get tasks done more efficiently and safely."
good,"Great place to work , fast paced with different types of work and co-workers.  You need to be able to lift heavy objects and work Safely and in a timely manner."
good,Best opportunity for future if you get full hours it was fun working there if u like to communicate with people we used to help them to fill forms check the prices for them.
good,"I spent a winter break delivering packages as a seasonal helper and had fun with it. I got to ride around in a golf cart, the delivering system was easy to use and understand, and I got some good money during the holiday season."
good,Hard work dedication and a plan is what’s needed to survive here not for those who are not strong willed. Management can be iffy but good work environment
good,"If you pay your dues work hard things will work out at UPS. Great benefits Medical dental vision etc. Retirement,  vacation outstanding pay. Job security. With outstanding equipment. Even though it hasn’t always been easy I am very grateful for my job at UPS"
good,"I arrrived at work and got started removing packages from truck.  I helped drivers if they had a packages that were leaking or if those packages had problems.  "
good,"Lot of room to advance, with enjoyable people to work with. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the speed of the job. Longer hours than average."
good,Great place to work and good paying union backed company.  You must work for years to be full time but there is a lot of advancement opportunities within the company.
good,Ups is a great place to work the co workers are great and management is great but I had to leave because of the start time was changed  with little notice and I wasn’t able to work the hours
good,"if you need a job to make extra money for the holidays this is a great place to to work, you work about 4 hours a day maybe a little more just to get the work done"
good,"The store owner really cares about his employees. He cares about their concerns and overall how they're doing in life, which was very refreshing for me."
good,"The pay and benefits are good,but the management is horrible. Once you obtain full time you are in like flynn, but there is no garuntee that you will. It is highly competitive and a lot of workers rely on the union to keep their jobs, only after you acquire full time"
good,"I had to relocate in order to have a place to live, but could not just transfer as I thought. I did not get hired back on after multiple attempts working with the on-line application process and the local manager at that location."
good,"It was a good job, you just need to be ready to work your butt off! The people I worked with were nice and offered help where they could. If you're in need of a good paying job UPS is a good one."
good,"UPS was a seasonal job I had before I went away to school that up coming semester, I enjoyed working for ups it was cool I would recommend a friend to work there"
good,Productive & fast paced that keeps you busy. Can be stressful at times and you must put safety first be aware of your surroundings and work quickly and efficiently.
good,Honestly it's grind to wake up and work hard but thats what you get at ups. U dont make squat when you first start but once you pay your dues it gets easier and benefits are great with the chance to move up as a driver or management.
good,"sales & business development executive and have experienced in account management. a strong business accumen. Have experienced much knowledge in people management, customer management and salesforce activities."
good,Working at UPS is demanding both physically and mentally keeping up with the belt and having to organize the trucks you're assigned can cause stress in the work environment. don't take the job unless you know you can take it or you want to become a driver.
good,Be prepared for manual labor. in a work area like UPS you want to always keep busy because packages need to be sent to their correct destination. where I worked the managers and other employees were really cool. in a work environment like UPS you have to follow protocol especially health and safety. Do not be a nuisance. If you hate labor do not apply but if you do not mind it apply.
good,"Once I get there I start to unload trucks of different lengths, different kinds of boxes and products. Sometimes if unloading is not busy, I will load or tape boxes. If is really slow sometimes they will look for things to have you do and if not then you will be able to go home."
good,"They pay well and have great benefits for a part time job. They also have lots of opportunities to get overtime which is after 5 hours of work. If your consider yourself a tough person but have never worked for UPS, you might need to reconsider."
good,"If you don’t mind working hard and long hours , this is the place for you . You will get all the benefits you and your family will need . But they will only see you early in the morning and after 730 and night and of course weekends . If your ok with that the pay is the best in their line of work . Their top pay is about 10 to 12 dollars more hourly than any competitors."
good,"The people I worked with made every day I worked at UPS an absolute joy, I love those people and talk to them outside of work on a regular basis, I highly recommend people to work there if they can"
good,"Structured and Fast paste environment must be able to balance and determine critical and non-critical priorities and plan accordingly, must be flexible to an ever changing environment..."
good,"Before I say anything I want anyone that’s reading this to know something... This is a very hard job to work at, a lot and I mean A LOT of people quit within their first two weeks of starting. I don’t recommend starting right before peek season since that’s the worst time of the year. The job itself is ok, I load thousands of packages a day in 18 wheelers, it’s a lot of hard work and it’s stressful. Some of the stuff I don’t like about the job is no matter how long you work (2 hours or 8 hours) you ONLY and I mean ONLY get ONE ten minute break, some may say it’s illegal, but it’s not illegal in New Jersey if you’re over 18 years old. Something else I don’t like is how some of the supervisors are if you are just one minute late to work, or you took one minute to long on your break, they will take that minute and remove it from your paycheck. Where I work the people are nice though (PD 5) but it is a lot of work, so if you really want this job make sure you are ready!!"
good,"Being a holiday driver will stretch you, your time, your body, and your relationships. Make sure your wife knows you probably won't be home for Christmas! I enjoyed driving and the daily challenges that came along with the job."
good,"I worked as a package handler and enjoyed working there for the most part. I had a difficult time with personal life because I worked the sunrise shift but the work was fun at times. Be prepared to work hard, you can't be lazy here or you'll negatively impact the people around you."
good,Wish I was able to stay longer and get hired permanently this is a company with great benefits and offers longevity and employment would recommend anyone to apply for this company once hired on permanently
good,Easy to do jobs. Easy schedule to work. Flexible work hours. Amazing benefits for families. Amazing benefits for college tuition. easy to learn a task with fast promotions.
good,Helped driver deliver packages to customers. Driver's where very helpful. They explained the delivery process very clearly.  It made delivering the packages very easy.
good,Wear comfortable shoes and always bring a lunch. If your not a people person do not apply to UPS. You will have to talked to customers face to face or via phone calls everyday
good,During my almost 10 years with UPS I learned a lot and was treated fairly for the most part.  Most of my co-workers were like family and are still considered friends.
good,Okay job not best excellent benefits. Some days will be boring and slow while oftsr days will be fast. Some weeks over 25 hours while other weeks will only be 15.
good,Great job! Has great benefits for you or your family! Ups gives you the opportunity to grow in the company! It’s hard work but very worth it if you like being your own boss!
good,"The day goes by fast when there are packages coming into the trailer none stop, the lunch break comes fast, feels like half an hour but it's actually it more than an hour."
good,The flow is very fast its either you get it or you don't granted they could take the time to train people more but other than that its a real easy job.
good,The hardest part of the job is withstand the pain & wear and tear of loading boxes into the trailers and helping people who need help and was messed up bad.
good,"Working at UPS can be very overwhelming because of the heavy work load each day and the short time frame it needs to be completed in. Ontop of that, it is a very fast paced environment so you really have to make sure you are focused but aside from that it is actually a great place to work in. You get the chance to meet alot of amazing people, supervisors are very friendly, the pay is nice and it's a great way to stay in shape."
good,Safely deliver the product loaded on your truck. Follow the UPS rules and deliver the products in a timely manor before businesses close. Arrange the deliveries in the correct orders.
good,"Good experience.  Arrived around 10a and off time varied based on volume of packages.  "
good,"When I worked for UPS, I worked for a franchise store. While I liked my job overall, when I did advance to the position of Print Manager for several months, I was not offered any increased compensation. This is even after I had to train three new employees. I really liked the Owner of the store, who was my boss, and the clients overall were pretty easy to deal with. However, we never had enough help in the Print Department, and the environment was stressful."
good,A typical day of work would include lifting from the time you clock in to the time you clock out with a ten minute break in between. The people you work alongside with are fantastic characters. The part time supervisors are typically helpful and display ideal management styles. The hardest part of the job comes when you move from a package handler into a position of management.
good,Good job most of the supervisors are good to the workers if you are looking for a part time job this is good go in work 4-5 hours a day easy once you get used to it
good,Enjoyed most aspects of work with UPS. Experienced both part time and full time employment and he benefits stayed the same. Only draw back is inability to take vacation during peak season.
good,I worked at UPS as a contractor but felt like an employee.  The management team was wonderful and treated me like part of the team. I was an individual contributor and was often left to do my day to day activities without being micro-managed.
good,"Pretty good part time job, very fast paced and physically demanding. It was a huge facility so lots and lots of people, so you are bound to find some people you get along with or could move to a different area if you didn’t like someone. Management was alright, the main things at ups is that everyone is a hard worker!"
good,There is many aspects of the job that relies on safe work procedures. You must have a great memory. also be able to observe change and manage with that change.
good,Expectations are demanding.  UPS still has an old culture and expectations for a long work day and hard work is still intact.  You can learn many things from a company of this size and may have an avenue to move into other fields.
good,Working at UPS Package Handler was a collaborative experience. With the Fast paced work accompanied by the heavy lifting brought strength development to workers as well as team building skills. A typical day was starting to work by unloading the trucks the minute the clock rang until it was break time. There was no room for error and workers were quite often let go.
good,"The job is decent is you have another job or school. If you plan on not going to school or find another job, then staying longer starts to pay off once you've passed the 15 year mark. There's guys there that have 20+ years there and reaping the benefits for sticking around for so long. This only applies to package handlers. I don't have much information regarding other jobs there."
good,"I enjoyed working with ups and the experiences I gained from working with the company.Its an easy going job but u gotta be decaded to your work. I also learned that they’re family ,they look out for one another and work as a team"
good,very hard work but you can change worker position to supervisor but you would lose your job security supervisors and managers don't have job security.
good,"For a part time job (pretty much where almost everyone starts, not always though) to offer the benefits that they offer is truly enticing. It is definitely hard work, and job assignment when starting off plays a key role in one’s desire/ability to want to stay with the company."
good,pretty good place to work not too stressful full of nice people  nice hours and nice pay would recommend to anyone looking for a decent job if your in school
good,Great place to work. Numbers driven atmosphere. Employees are like family. Management takes care of and respects their team.  Everyone for the most part enjoys working there.
good,In the Airport work with people that you get to know better . work with them to load and unload cargo in and out of planes  overall I would love to work there again
good,"Very Fast paced job but great part time schedules and working hours, while employed i met a few good associates and learned a lot about how our packages & mail are packed and shipped around the world."
good,Each day was fast paced with little rest. It is a good job for people that needs little down time or dislikes a slow paced environment. It's better to be hired on before or after the peek season (Between Oct to Dec)
good,"Everyone is nice and is super helpful, they really are laid back about everything so if you have issues with being late or leaving early they will work with you."
good,"I felt really graceful for belong to the UPS family for eleven years, was a really good place for work I grew up as professional and personal too. I feel so proud to be part of UPS"
good,"I was proud to be a UPS employee.  This is a place that truly looks out for their employees and their family.  If opportunity was given to return to my formal job, I would do it in a heartbeat."
good,"UPS has been around for a long time and it's all about hard work and production. There many perks including great benefits, annual raises, paid time off, sick and personal days and pension. I work in the warehouse part time and receive all of these benefits. There is no other job out there that gives you more for a part time job."
good,"I like working with the people i work with,it is a fun evoroment.you can also have the opportunity to.have ups help further your education and that's a bonus."
good,On the line by 5 or 5:15 one break in the middle of the morning and then right back to until 8 am. I learned how to create space with no room. The environment was very fair. Hardest part of the job was how quick the boxes came down the line. Most fun part was mcdonald's breakfast every friday.
good,at time the work could be very stressful and very fast! at times you may see a group of people not kkeeping pace with you but luckily there would be those willing to be team players and help out
good,"UPS provides great products and services and many of the people I worked with were smart and helpful.  Due to the nature of being a large, Fortune 50 company, I found the pace to be too slow for my liking.  Decisions are made at very high levels of the company, and at least in the marketing department, individuals have little say over their career paths."
good,The worst part was the way some people talked to you. Yelling as if they are your parents just because they feel they can even if they are not your supervisor. My crew supervisor never yelled or disrespected us.He saw everything as a teaching moment. Everything else was great.
good,Arbeit war zwar hart. dafür der Stundenlohn überdurchschnittlich gut. Management hat öfters gestört weil sie echt das letze bisschen von einem abverlangen.
good,Like any company there are people within that can make the job not such a great place to be. I have worked many different positions with UPS and learned and enjoyed with all of them. There are many great people in this organization that work their tail ends off. I would most definitely work for them again.
good,"Fast paced, Safe friendly environment, room to move up when jobs are available. Great benefits, full health care, Vision, dental, 401k, paid vacations, paid sick days."
good,"- is a good place to work for long"
good,"The employees are great, until you get to managment. Managment dosent care much about their employees, it all comes to numbers for them. But alot of us the work preload make up for it with how well we treat each other."
good,Great place for advancement and for someone who doesn't have work experience or haven't attended college! If you work hard and have patient you can advance to a 6 figure position!
good,"Noisy and fast paced environment.youll be on the move a lot. No warehouse a.c. at all, if it's cold outside its cold or colder inside.most people have a positive  attitude to help with moral."
good,"Great place to start a career. Positions of higher responsibilities are hard to come by as many employees stay in a respective position for  quite some time. New positions are created only under growth situations. As with most publicly traded company's, benefits are slowly disappearing."
good,If it wasn't for my family ailment I would still be there to this day everything is set in place for you to succeed all you have to do is apply yourself and pay attention it's that simple !
good,"I only worked there for a short period of time, but I was offered to go back if needed. I loved the potential for having college paid for by the company. Great people to work with!"
good,"inexperienced manager with no automotive knowledge. lack of proper training, too short of training period, pretty much just thrown to the wolves with no guidance."
good,"Typical work day is going through security everyday, regular employees cannot bring cell phones inside the building during your shift. Load and unload trucks  with various of different size packages,"
good,UPS was a cool experience. It was part time and the time went by really fast.UPS has great benefits but the pay is really low.I think its also a good workout. I would work there part time for the benefits.
good,I really enjoyed my 9 years working foe this company. I’m saddened to say that I hoped it would have lasted longer. My affliction ultimately won that battle so hopefully one day UPS gives me another oppportunity
good,typical day: arriving at work at 5 am and sometimes working 10-12 hours a day. Coworkers were great and fun to be around.  Learned new job experiences and job culture.
good,Everyone in this company full time had an average of 13 years that means employees were happy with wages and benefits .Supervisors are great managers and work with u and let u do your job the way you were trained.
good,"A small, close knit store where one checks in packages and runs the register. Greatly helps organization and money handling skills. It is extremely easy to get to know your coworkers very well."
good,I work in a very fast paced environment loading and unloading trucks. Boxes weight from 1 pound to 300 pounds. It is a part time job and you must move fast during the shift.
good,well organized global company in logistics industry.
good,Good place to work tough on the body. Fast paced.. Hot no air conditioning in the warehouse and heavy lifting.. Cold in the winter no heat.. Plenty of opportunity to move up
good,It was hard working at UPS. It was a very fast pace job that you have to keep up with the whole time working. Managers would get on you about moving to slow because you have to finish the truck at a certain period of time.
good,"Depending on the day, and probably location it can be very faced paced job, but also sow at times. there is team work and help when needed with questions and doubts."
good,I learned different computer skills. Having to reach high targets of tags per hour was difficult. There were different sizes of centres to process and if you were given all small ones it was very hard to make your goals.
good,"Great place to build work relations and get extra cash. From the months working there it was a paced environment, once work begins there’s no stoping it was fun and competitive."
good,"Easy website, I like that you you can type you resume if you don’t have one and they save it for the next application. It’s a nice website to looks for jobs"
good,Ups is a good company for you if you want a great carrer in package delivery. They have great benfits and great pay along with frequent pay rises. Ups is a fine company indeed
good,"Calling customers regarding their bills, receiving calls from customers about late deliveries, payments, etc. Learned several positions, customer service, billing, customer counter, shipping @ returning packages. Management was not easy to correspond with managers @ supervisors. Workplace was pleasant and employees were upbeat which made the day easier @ fun to work day by day. Nothing hard about these positions or my job. The most enjoyable was talking to customers and resolving their issues, and getting customers to commit to making their late payments."
good,"This company is a customer oriented, business oriented, and employee oriented entity. Employees are expected to adhere to company standards and expectations. The management is open door, but employees are expected to follow the chain of command. Work is fast paced, detailed, and can be somewhat seasonal. If you follow the objectives of both the safety and job environment. The best part of the job is the people you work with."
good,My most enjoyable part of a job is working others as a team I grown alike to the company coming to work every day seeing face that can help you become successfully in every day.
good,I learned a lot of responsibility and how to work with quick reactions and response. UPS has a great company for opportunities for the long term and is a company that is growing nonstop.
good,"There is a lot of lifting, lowering and bending of the knees and back. its very fast pace, productive, a hot environment, and competitive. The hardest part of the job is the constant moving, lifting and lowering sometimes heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part is the day tends to go by a lot more quicker since your are constantly moving. One thing I can confirm is you will sweat and you will lose weight quickly."
good,Good place to work towards a career and management opportunities are available. Several shifts are offered to accommodate all walks of life and the company is involved and gives back to the community.
good,"This job taught me to not be late to work and move fast or get left behind. The hardest part of the job was the schedule; I would have to wake up at like 3 in the morning just to make it there at 4, I didn't have a car at the time so it made it even more difficult. I did somehow made it work on time (often) however I was only there for seasonal so I didn't stay long."
good,This was a decent company to work at. The environment is not that bad. I was driving for a while and I like that much better. Driving is better than warehouse work.
good,Management is pretty good at working with the employees in terms of a work life balance. Typical workday are pretty much written out. You come in and you know exactly what you need to accomplish.
good,This company helped me build an even greater mental fortitude than I had before. Working at UPS was good but as a college student it was more difficult because of the lack of flexibility in the schedule.
good,"Stress full sometimes,"
good,"UPS was a fast and easy job for me. I made my own schedule and did mostly overtime sometimes ,even though it wasn't mandatory it was great experience."
good,Awesome place to work but unless you're a driver or managment  you dont get a ton of hours but if you're looking to rise in the ranks you'll get plenty of hours with great pay and awesome benefits.
good,"aprendizaje: excelente empresa para aprender en diferentes área."
good,"As I worked for a hotel location, it is a little different than a standard UPS store. However it was still an enjoyable job with fantastic management, good coworkers, and overall good customers as well."
good,"Loved the environment, people were quick to help. Hardest part of the job was peak season. It was extremely fast paced and very long hours. Best part of job was the benefits, but you only received them after a year of employment."
good,"I liked working at UPS as a feeders associate alot. I plan on woking there again, it was a temporary position so if i had the opportunity i would gladly work there again."
good,"A nice place to work at with, interesting customers, and fun co-workers. Hours are easy and flexible. My manager is really nice and understanding of my school schedule as well."
good,I worked there for 4 years and quit to go to college. It was a great place to work and the benefits we're amazing considering you start out part time.
good,In the supply chain solutions division over the regular brown delivery division.  Managed a warehouse for critical computer parts and a small distribution operation for a veterinary pet food company.  Fast paced and different challenges daily.
good,"Ups can be a great place to work for. A typical work day at UPS can sometimes be an easy and smooth day it just depends on how the sort runs. I have learned a lot over the years from working here. I have been in management for the last two years and it is definitely a challenge. Working in management i must say i am learning a lot. overall, UPS is a great company to work for."
good,you can work short schedules while going to school and then make a career at UPS after graduation. So many opportunities as they promote from within almost 100%.
good,I worked there for 40 years. The best years were before the company went public. After that you were just a number. The benefit package is probably one of the best you can find. Vacations after 30 yrs of service was 8 weeks a year.
good,Het was leuk werken bij UPS maar bij blackman is het ook leuk werken omdat ik altijd positief naar de dag kijk
good,Supervisors at night time are easy goers... Like to work with them. Except that the higher management doesnt consider your qualification the just go for who they want to promote..
good,Great pay. Enjoyable coworkers. Great benefits. Very intense work environment. Advancement usually requires relocation. Each day is different no set routine.
good,"The Only reason why I am leaving UPS is because I am moving to New York City otherwise I would continue to seek a full-time job over there. They are having a pay raise within a couple days due to a contract agreement within the company, so I think it would be fun to continue my time with UPS if I was to stay."
good,"I was Assistant Manager of this UPS Store in Powder Springs. There was always something challenging or new to work on. I enjoyed helping customers pack their boxes. Customers also brought in templates for printing ads and brochures. We designed flyers and mailings for businesses. I really enjoyed dealing with the retail side of the Store."
good,"This job is a very competitive job that offers many amazing benefits and great pay, however you have to work very hard with uncertain hours to earn that pay. Once you become a driver there is very little to no room for error."
good,"This job kept me busy and fit since it had a lot of heavy lifting involved.  Coworkers were very friendly to me and customers.  Management wasn't the best at organization, but I always got paid on-time."
good,You get a good work out moving all those boxes around. It is all about how fast you move and you will hear it if you are not keeping pace. The dress code is casual.
good,This company Is Not To Good To Work At Because They Don’t Give You Your Right Amount Of money On Your Checks . They Take off To Much Taxes & The Lunch Break is Only 45 minutes.llb
good,"This job I think is a good experience for me. The pay is not the greatest. But the benefits that kick in after 1 year of employment are very good. It is very physical and constantly busy and constantly physical so you should be prepared for that- you will get a workout."
good,Some days the belts were backed up so far people stood on them and kicked and jammed packages into the trailers and i would be hit by them multiple times. Packages over 50 pounds and above would be on the belts even though they shouldn't have been. The job starts off slow but speeds up very rapidly and then doesn't stop until shifts are over. The equipment was ancient and turned off several times during a single shift and hindered production. The belts would be spilling into the trailer as i waited for my device to turn back on. Some nights i would be lucky if it didn't freeze.
good,"I've honestly only been at UPS for less than a week now. It's definitely an easy job to get, but this place does have a HIGH turnover. There was 30 of us in the beginning of the week and 3 people have quit already. It's more than likely more people will quit by the end of the week because this job is not for everyone. "
good,I worked customer service at night and it was very entertaining. I learned the system of packaging and travel. Management was stressed at times which made the life of drivers hectic. The hardest part of my job was not being at home with my kids at night. The most enjoyable is my work family. We all were very close and loved one another.
good,Monitor the work of UPS drivers and package handlers to verify all work is completed in a timely fashion. Effectively motivate and direct staff to streamline and maximize productivity and efficiency. Inspect all loading equipment and devices to ensure they meet safety regulations and are functioning at the highest standards. Verify hourly employee’s time cards and distribute weekly salary. Responsible for all new hire pack-handler training. Introduced the Loader Development re-training program .
good,The hub gets very busy and you always remain busy and hardworking and tine flies by. The benefits are great but overall the job is difficult and not for everyone.
good,"Love the opportunities within the company, that’s why I’m still there. There is so many opportunities within the company. It took me 6 months to become a supervisor because I came in the door and worked hard."
good,Excellent company with many years of opportunity and a winning culture over the years. Wish there are more full time opportunities in the near future for truck loaders and  was  more available.
good,"good people to work with, great managers at all levels. great time off only wish there were more opportunities for advancement, i would have never left i loved working there."
good,"A typical day at work is just pulling packages from a cage to a truck. Pretty simple and easy, the hardest part of the job is to finish on time which most of the time is not your fault. Some manager/supervisors dont care too much about what you do but they regulate that you dont go too far, so it’s not like you can do whatever you want."
good,"UPS is an excellent part-time employer.  Hourly jobs are supposed to be secure because of the union.  The union also offers a variety of other benefits including health insurance, raises, and paid vacations.  However, some of the positions are very physically demanding.  Non-union managers are not very sympathetic towards hourly employees in these positions as they only seem to care about getting the job done quick (as they don't want to have to pay their hourly employees overtime) and also so that they get their packages out on time."
good,"It's a physically demanding job best suited for young people.  If you are motivated and work hard,  advancement opportunities are available. Shifts are primarily Monday-Friday which is good.  The hours aren't the best as far as family life is concerned."
good,"Punctual, responsible, educated, "
good,It was a fast pace working environment I was really good at unloading trucks fast pace. I was also go at loading the trucks as well and sorting the packages
good,Alot of work all day This is a job you would have to come in & be prepared to actually work because that's all there is to Do Once you get the hang of it
good,It's hard but it's manual labor so you have to expect that but it's not back breaking either. I would go to work there and everyone was friendly for the most part. If you had questions you could ask. People would help you also if you needed help.
good,Its A Good Place To Work But Its A Little To Much To Do And You Always Gotta Do Something That You Don't Wanna Do. But It Is a Good Company To Work At
good,"It is a great job to have, I really enjoyed the fast passed environment and hard work you have to do, but it can get very stressful at times. The job is perfect for exercise and people who like to put in the work. One thing I want to touch on are the hours, it is very tough on students, the Monday thru Friday can get very long and it might be good for the company to think of giving a worker the day off or easier task i.e. switch from loading to unloading every once in a while."
good,"My typical work day start with a meeting in the start of the day with other supervisors. We discuss have to work as fast and as safe as we can. Everyday i must complete paperwork due at the end of the night, this paperwork involves a safety observation, safety questions and a performance evaluation on each of my employees. The hardest part of my job is getting my employees to work as hard and as safe as i would do it. Its very hard to get people motivated. The best part of my job is when you work with a new employee and they one day perform up to the buildings standards."
good,Great place to set a career in. Fast paced with fair supervisors. Fairly paid with advancement opportunities. Great hours with overtime pay and time off.
good,Great customer service experience working in a shipping/copy center. I had a great boss and fun co-workers. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for customer service experience.
good,Great company to work for; work as a team; fast pace work environment; recognition by supervisor for meet set goals and or being a productive worker; great health benefits
good,"The job is very fast pace and timed, also requires you to be able to lift 70 plus pounds. The job keeps you in shape but have to stay on top of health because it’s easy to lose sleep and get dehydrated."
good,"Making sure packages get to the proper conveyor belts."
good,The hardest part about working at ups is you got to make sure your able to lift boxes. You only get one break for 10 minutes. You have to make sure you bring water. Follow rules cuz you could get hurt.
good,I have been working at UPS for so many years that everything is a casual day in the office. Due to the high pace work volume built up stress can be the common trend.
good,"Excellent for hours and pay, especially overtime pay. Hard work, keeps you busy and in decent shape. Fun to work with others, treated well by management."
good,"Fast paced, hard labor work. Not for everyone. Get ready to be sore and dirty when you clock out. Do your job right and you will succeed. Can be fun if working with right people."
good,"Local P & D driver with 12 to 20 stops per day.  Trained new employees when hired. The hardest part of the job was getting the freight delivered on time, keeping the customers happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being outdoors and meeting people everyday and making new friends."
good,"UPS is a rough place to work. I have been laid off almost every day from being a delivery driver because we are severely overstaffed. This just doesn't cut it for the average American worker. I have bills to pay, but with no work it can be tough to get by."
good,Very Stressful specially at the beginning. Because you need to know the area they assign you. You can make a lot of money after one year if they take you permanently.
good,I love work seasonal at UPS once I got the hang of things my day went smoothly. the supervisor were professional and aim to help assist you with know what to do if you was clear on that.
good,UPS is a good company to work for because of the benefits and the fact that it pays for school. The work is hard and the work conditions can be brutal during the summer and winter seasons. Workers are backed by the union and that usually makes managements job difficult.
good,"UPS was a challenge due to the large amount of volume they receive in the holiday season. The amount of packages you would receive in your truck everyday was overwhelming, but if you were a driven individual you could get them delivered. Safety is an important part of this job because you are moving so much and in and out of the truck a great deal. Do this safely so you don't do damage your joints and body."
good,Fun people to work with. Very hard labor having to lift up to 200 lbs. with another person. Sometimes you had to work alone and it gets boring being by yourself.
good,It is a fast-paced work environment. You need to work hard to keep up. The hours as a package handler are either great or terrible depending on the person. Management overall was ok.
good,"Typical day at UPS is fast pace, hard working."
good,"Only being a seasonal worker as a ""loader"", I learned how to utilize my time and space provided and use my skills to accomplish tasks increasing the rate of productivity. This is a job where moving objects become important. The importance is; keeping self from injury while moving, considering what goes where, and remembering other aspects of work."
good,"I enjoyed working for the usp company, I like doing a lot of hard and physical labor. I also enjoyed my fellow co-worker, the driver that I had to assist. He made working at the job every fun and worth while."
good,Driver helper is somewhat fun you ride in a ups truck all day and help out you have to walk a lot and sometimes you can’t find the correct package but other then that’s it’s fun
good,"overall work experience at UPS was great, management was great. room for growth, benefits were also good. "
good,"It would seem great to know that anything over 25 hours a week is counted as overtime but....Only work about 15-20 hours a week. The best part about the job was the discounts and benefits  you have. Life, dental, health."
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday.   The co-workers that I worked with were all fantastic, and we all got along. Made my work days so much better going to a job with great people."
good,"After a year of working there you will receive full dental, medical, and vision where the insurance company will pay 90% of the bill.  The pay during the early morning shift is horrible.  On average even a seasoned worker will only get less than 20 hours worth of pay.  Pay increases are small to the point it's a few dollars over minimum wage."
good,Ups is a great job and has many opportunities for advancement. The only problem i ever had working there was i dealt with racism. The upper management handled the situation very well
good,"If you want to build a career, make a comfortable amount living, and don't mind not being excited by your job, look no further! It's worth noting, I worked third shift as a part-time supervisor, while also working 2 other jobs. That being said, I hated working here. It was intense work in the middle of the night and I didn't have time to sleep at all. Objectively speaking, it's really not a bad place to work. They care about keeping their employees (even though turnover is high). The benefits are ridiculous - full insurance  for part-time employees after a year. You get benefits immediately as a supervisor. Tuition reimbursement is available to all employees. I was promoted to supervisor after a month just because I asked. All in all it's a really great company to work for, just not what I personally wanted out of life."
good,"Quick paced environment,  everything is based on time and safety and efficiency.  Great benefits,  room for advancement,  change of position,  easy to relocate or transfer."
good,Ready to learn anything. Visual training. Can pick up fast. Also can train. Can do desk and physical work. Has no problem working overtime. Can work with anybody in any position
good,Great job and position easy work wanted to get up and go to work everyday nice travel time no problem following rules and abiding by them... very safe and equipment available to use whenever needed
good,I enjoyed my time working at UPS. My supervisors and peers where great people to work with. The part-time schedule really helped as well to balance life and work time.
good,"As with all the other reviews, this job is VERY fast paced and physically demanding. They are not lying. If you are in good shape and can catch on quickly to the flow, you will do ok. Lots of great camaraderie within the groups you work with, but management does not see you as a person but a “body”. The facilities have no heat or AC so add that to the physical nature of the work, it can be downright brutal getting use to it. VERY high turnover because of these reasons. Many new faces from month to month, so don’t be surprised if you feel cold shoulders at first. Nothing personal, not many last more than a few weeks. There’s also little chance at getting full time in this position, but you do get a good benefits package after a year. The only problem is having to wait that year, because you’re on that financial cusp where your income is just enough to disqualify you for public assistance, but not enough to afford private insurance. This is a great job for college students, especially with the generous tuition reimbursement and part time hours."
good,"Great company, I love my job. I do not like management at this time but there is room for improvement. Workplace culture is intact and is a great culture to work in."
good,"A typical day of work is coming to work and sorting 2,500 to 3,000 in one night. Make sure that the person works with you has enough supplies to work with for the night. Also, the packages have to be sorted to the correct bin. Pull packages out of the bins, bag and label them, and make sure it's going to the correct destination. "
good,It’s a good job and builds into a nice career if you can survive on part time hours and money    I’m looking to stay with the company but need to supplement my income with part time work or possibly full time depending on what is available
good,UPS is a great opportunity to begin a career and learn transferable technical and functional skills. The environment was friendly yet competitive and they have a nice work life balance.
good,It was okay people were nice I wouldve stayed but I had school during time I worked so I had to leave. But super nice place depending on how you want to work is ups. Its rough but good up going job
good,"This job is very fast paced and very physical. I am not a person that likes to avoid work during my shift so I enjoy that you are allowed to take on additional responsibility if you so choose so, in that regard, I stay very busy from clock in to clock out. I work with the team that transports the loaded air containers full of priority packages to and from the UPS aircraft and it's always exciting and occasionally stressful if the unexpected should occur such as the last minute break down of one of the jets. I have also worked inside the hub sort facility and enjoy that work as well. The begining pay rate is low, but there are opportunities abound to move into other positions, move into management, or learn other valuable skills and the college tuition reimbursement program is great.  Most of the supervisors are a joy to work with and often express their gratitude for jobs well done."
good,"A typical work day is filled with loading packages into your designated trailer. The managers are friendly, for the most part. Co-workers are talkative and cooperative. Conversations with co-workers and management are very enjoyable."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for.  very fast paced environment, so you have to be motivated daily to very up.  great family benefits, including medical and dental."
good,"good seasonal job to have if you need extra cash on the side. Drivers are very nice, while some of the package handlers can be iffy. Customers were always nice to me and some were gracious enough to tip."
good,"This was a temporary seasonal job.  I like the people I worked with, but sometimes would go in for 2-3 hours of work.  You only work until the work you have for the day is done.  There was also several Fridays that I did not get my check until the next Monday or Tuesday"
good,Welcoming and friendly environment. The best part was interaction with customers. I learned how to ship packages and gained a lot of customer service skills.
good,great company to work for. Hard work ok pay. lots of people retiring . they like to promote from within . you have to be patient with your career to see true improvements.
good,UPS has been a great company to grow with.  The people are dedicated and the culture is consistent across the company.  Although there are sometimes disagreements between union employees and management there has always been a respect and ability to make it past most issues.
good,"The UPS Store in Zachary, Louisiana was a fun place to walk into work everyday. The work is quick-paced when it's flowing, but it's also very relaxed at certain periods during the day."
good,you will be put at a door and as soon as the packages start coming down the line and slide down your shoot you start loading as fast as you can. Then when you fill the truck you either go to another door and start loading another truck or you go help another co-worker until you have the next truck or trailer at your door.
good,"Typical work day is 4 hours of loading packages from the conveyor to the truck. You get a 10 minute break a little over halfway through. Its a nice environment as the fellow employees are kind, and if you have any issues, management is ready to deal with it. The best part of the job is your ability to listen to music books or podcasts during work as the work requires very little mental engagement. It trained me to focus on a job even if its something manual and somewhat boring."
good,"Good place to work. If your franchise owner is cool, you got it made. Very good place to learn on the job because it's usually very busy and co workers are friendly. Customers ask a lot of questions and are inexperienced so if you are friendly and helpful, they appreciate it"
good,"Good job and benefits if you’re willing to break your back. Usually quick hire process, start out unloading or pre load at ungodly hours. All in all it’s a normal job. Some days are better than others."
good,Supervised driver and in-house staff it was like family gathering Monday thru Friday. I learned to deal a lot of personalities came in handy with all positions I held.  The staff who made work for made it great place to work at.
good,"it is fast paced and can get stressful really fast but for the most part it is fun to work there. "
good,Fast pace and rushed environment . Good benefits but must be there at least a year. No dress code except for shoes so that’s easy. The part-time hours are good if you have another job
good,Working at UPS at the time that I did was the hardest job I encountered. It was hard work and very fast paced. But working there helped mold me because I went into General Motors already experiencing something like it. So although General Motors is much harder I was prepared for it.
good,I didnt get breaks because i was working part time and i didnt really get breaks either and it was forced overtime. Just didnt seem fair at times just felt as if I was over worked sometimes.
good,"it was a good place to work because it was out in the street, everyday was a diferent place to go and diferent people to meet. i learn a lot about culture."
good,Overall very good company. You can end up spending a lot of time in meeting for planning however the are usually very production and forward thinking.
good,"Typical day of work starts at 3:00am. You go to your assigned trucks and begin loading. You take packages into the truck based on the label and put them on the right truck. The whole day is spent loading more and more boxes in the car, making sure to allow the driver to locate the boxes as he makes his deliveries. There is not a lot of stuff to learn about it. The management is hit or miss, it depends on how strong the union is and who the managers are. Hardest part of the job is the hours."
good,"Normal workday, get the job done and go home.  Working at UPS taught me to be assertive, outspoken, remain cool under-pressure,professional, urgency, to take initiative and teamwork."
good,"I enjoyed my time as a unloader there are some good people to work with on the team and some arent and  like every one else not sure if they want to work.  A typical day was arivving early getting a head start unloading trucks for a few hours there where no hard parts is it hard work yes but no hard parts to the job."
good,Broad training and experience new things coming into the market so learning never stops. different type of clients coming in for all sorts of jobs from basic shipping and printing to large custom jobs
good,"Good old fashioned manual labor. Just the whole miss load thing makes the job stressful and very competitive. Only those that get none or very low stay. I could properly load a truck and make it easy for drivers. I can keep the belt moving and help my co-workers. Just not perfect, so miss loads. Had perfect attendance and on time. Just those miss loads. If you dont like the stress of perfection this is definitely not the job for you. If you aren't perfect dont expect a long term work life."
good,UPS was very fast going at times but if you like to drive  very good benefits but for some reason the preloaders don’t get that much for what they do and are a major part of the company
good,Usually management wants us to work 5 to 10 minutes early so we can stretch and prepare for the lifting.Also they encourage employees to stay hydrated.
good,"Although physically and mentally demanding, the job was challenging in all the ways it should be, and is a great introduction to the labor market. Learned a lot about myself, what I want, and made a fair deal of money while doing so."
good,Fair wages but paid time off was low.  Lots of good training was available. Fast paced multitasking job.  Need to be on your toes at all times. Management was fair but advancement was hard.
good,My times at ups was great but it came with its bumps and bruises here and there for example they would be unorganized and have you waiting for a driver for several minutes/hrs.
good,Great pace to work for . They have great service and respect for its customers. Fast past work place . Great place to work if your desiring to go back to school
good,"Good company policies. I have not worked here for a long time yet but the staff is friendly and the it is a good place to work."
good,"A test of commitment and endurance begins your career at UPS.  From there, you choose which path you want to take for your career at UPS. You may move into management or stay a teamster and become fulltime as a warwhouse employee or you may choose to become a package car driver"
good,"Come into work turn computer on and off you go to work. Learned many task though out my 39 years of service. Dependability, leadership, accuracy, loyal & great work ethics."
good,"This job is a Part time job that offers benefits. There is no real opportunity to advance, unless you stay for a very long time, maybe 7 years before you can become a driver. You work your 3 hours and then go home everyday. Must follow training methods and safe work methods to be successful."
good,"It was a seasonal temp job.  The hours were varied.  The work was not hard.  The shifts were varied, as were the days.I had high hopes that I would be hired on permanent after the season was over, but wasn't.  I would have liked to stay on and eventually become a driver for UPS.  The job was good and the benefits were great."
good,"UPS is a very stable company and I learned a lot from a logistics standpoint. The management team was ok, but some of the culture did not keep up with current times. Hardest thing to get used to at UPS is the culture, but it was enjoyable because in my leadership role I was able to make decisions and had support of my management team."
good,"Great job that was different every day. Lots of computer work, plus audited trucks to ensure proper delivery."
good,"Ups is a great job if you are looking for something that will bring in extra money and give you stability with great benefits. It is very fast pace, and can put a lot of pressure onto a single person to do good. Management works with you and helps you through your work day. For me, the part time position allowed me to dedicate my day towards school while bringing in decent cash."
good,Professional and productive. Applying oneself to any position to be productive is truly the way. The life/work balance was a challenge but the company was open to accommodate the changes.  Well appreciated.
good,"Each day is a new adventure, with its own challenges."
good,"A Typical day at work would be hot, stressful, and also low paid. All employees at UPS need to get paid more than 10.50 an hour. What i learned in this job is many managers were taking advantage of our timing and hours of work. The enjoyable part of this job was the benefits of having full coverage in your health status."
good,"It's not an easy job, but it works.  Plenty of advancement opportunities, if you work hard, show up, and proactively communicate with upper management and/or Union Stewards.  "
good,"Excellent place to work for a second income, great benefits. Supervisors change constantly as well as management. Not the cleanliest atmosphere. The best part is working consistently and in short work hours. It's fun."
good,"This is a very hard, fast paced, physically demanding job. You need to be ready to break a sweat and be soaking wet by the time your shift is done. You will be stuck in the back of a dark, hot trailer your whole shift pretty much. If your physical endurance isn't the best of the best, you'll either quite, or become the best of the best after working here. You need to be fast paced, and able to move heavy packages every second. This is not a friendly environment and unless you are dedicated and determined to keep a job, I wouldn't recommend."
good,"Good company overall. Pay is good, people are good, benefits are good. If you like to work a lot of hours then this job is for you. Benefits are really good also."
good,"Ups is a hard working company, the reason why I am finding a second job is because I feel that ups is not enough money to take care of myself by just having that one job."
good,I learned how to use many machines and about different area codes.It was my first job and it’s a good place to learn about fast paced work environments.
good,From unloading to loading trailers. UPS is a great place to work. There head strong and you look for greatness in a place where you can move up fast in the company.
good,"started in peak season, learned the postmasters job, but when peak was over i had no where to work, they would tell me to leave at times, i was in the early morning shift, took a while to have a spot to work."
good,UPS offers the best benefits despite the low hours and the waiting process to make the big bucks. This job makes you feel like you’re building for the future as long as you’re willing to put the time in.
good,Probably one of the best city driving jobs you can get with 1 years experience. Great benefits tons of company discounts more than your usual amount of holidays union job. Workday consist of about 10 delivers and  6 pickups on average per day and your dispatch is not to much of a bother. Great work-life balance. Starting salary is way to low at $17.20 per hour for a job requiring a least a year experience. Starting out you’ll be on call and won’t get enough hours to make that pay work. Takes about 4 years to ramp up to top pay. So if your a seasoned driver with a family to support it might be a little hard to hang in there for 4 years.
good,"decent work, wasnt hard, very flexible and good with shifts. easy hire and quick to start work within a week of your interview. i dont regret working here i learned something"
good,I enjoy working at UPS a lot its a lot fun and good people but.
good,"High expectations - they expect you to load 200+ packages into 4 cars per hour"
good,"You get a mix of different types of people, both as coworkers and as supervisors. You work hard then you will get paid well for it. Overtime is permitted and will have plenty of opportunities to stay after shift."
good,"different shifts can accommodate to people needing a second job or kids. minimum wage to start. Benefits for you after one year, two years for dependents. If you are able to stay you can go into management or driver."
good,"The interview wasn't very difficult and the training was quite easy. long video and work together as a group tests. good place to work and take a shot. for Seasonal, good luck getting called back. but if they do, work you're way to become a driver or combo. it will take time. 5 years exact or less. or use this as a second job for the good benefits thats worth the time."
good,My day at the job was fast pace. I learn how to use  a scanning device and learn more about  the different routes and areas in the city. the Mangment team was pretty fare. I never had a problem. The hardest part of job to me was trying to drive and find out where you suspose to go at the same time. Another thing was getting  off at late hours. The most enjoyable part was the driving and geting to meet new people.
good,"I Loved Working There , It Was Fast Paced And Very Tiring But I Loved Every Bit Of It . The People Made Sure That If You Could Not Do There Were An Abundance Of People To Help You Out ."
good,"The way ups had regular training and exercises really tart to stick in your head, especially after 20 years and even if at first you think its stupid its start to make sense after a while. i mean thieve been in business since 1907 and have one of the biggest fleet of airplanes in the world."
good,"I would not recommend making working in a ups warehouse a career. The pay is low,they don’t give you enough hours,they’re always trying to rush you and make you leave early and the supervisors aren’t the best of people."
good,"Good place to work, environment is kind of iffy but if you have patience and are willing to stick it out you can go far within the company. Patience is a virtue"
good,It’s a very physical and hands on job . Good exercise for those of us that don’t really go to the gym. Organized work areas . It can be tiring at time
good,"good job, decent pay, amazing benefits. Lots of managers some good some not so much. good place for students and others looking for small supplemental income"
good,"UPS is a really fast pace environment, always something to do. I liked the fact you had opportunity to move up if you were at work when you are supposed to be and work hard."
good,"The workplace culture is divided between the union workers and the non union workers. Unfortunately this means that their may be a lot of tension from time to time. Although when it comes to the actual labor and safety, management usually does a good job at teaching new workers the regulations that must be followed in order for you to keep yourself safe."
good,"I worked as a seasonal driver helper. It got really cold in the vans, especially at night. Only some had decent heaters, but over all it wasn't terrible. They give you a coat for a uniform."
good,"Come find out yourself , great step in stone "
good,"UPS provides an interesting experience. The work there is very intense and quick, but so long as you do it, and do it well, you'll have a stable position. UPS also offers the possibility to rise up the company ladder at a very quick pace, with some people becoming managers in their shift a mere 6 months after starting there."
good,"Awesome to work for if you desperately need benefits for you and up to 9 dependants.  Rough place to work for a second job because it pays minimum wage and due to the union aspect of the job you will only get a pay raise very slowly, though surely.  You will also work whatever hours they tell you so it can be a bit of a burden if you already work 40 hours.  Your comfort will alwys be at the whim of the weather."
good,Working at the UPS is very easy. The work environment is very boring and there is very little communication between employees. it is a great for a first time or temporary job.
good,I got hired on by UPS during peak season as a driver helper. Didn't really care for that position. I was then placed as a package handler once the busy season was over. Quick money.
good,Good pay and benefits. Very structured with moderate pressure to perform job in a timely manner. Sometimes long hours but a good vacation package. Can be fun interacting with the public
good,"Good pay, really good benefits, enjoy working with other drivers and delivering to stores, officer personal is good to work with; however, management could use some consistency."
good,UPS is a good company to work for. They believe in advancement of their people and they are very keen on promoting minorities. The pay might not be the greatest but the experience and opportunities to advance out weigh that and make the job worth while.
good,"My time at UPS was during the Christmas holidays. I really enjoyed the job overall. It is kind of rewarding bringing people their Christmas packages. "
good,I worked as a seasonal helper and I had great drivers. the work is hard but time goes by pretty fast and you have a good time. the customers offer you drinks every now and then.
good,"It's a union job, so if you get in when you're young and have time to stay and build up, you could easily make $25+/hour.  But you will start at minimum, so you have to be willing to put in the time.  The hours are good and the benefits are amazing."
good,"I worked at UPS as a part-time, 3rd shift worker in the Worldport Freight Facility through college. Depending on where you go to college, UPS offers scholarship/tuition assistance and help paying for books. If you are a college student, it is a no-brainer to work at UPS. You work 4-6 hours at night and go to school during the day while getting paid AND getting help paying for school."
good,Ups was a good job it was just Seasonal so I only work for a couple months. I did packing and I loaded the truck up. I went in at 10pm intil 7am or 1am to 10am. It was very cold in the wherehouse.
good,"Must be willing to lift, read, and organize boxes at pace.Quick and on the fly decisonmaking practice. Work Together mentality. Hardest part is wrapping up, (putting a cap on workflow in proper timing prevents extraneous workflow from becoming yours) best part is all the brown gear!!"
good,"When I worked here, the hardest part was getting my job set up from management. The truck drivers were all very nice. I worked from 4-11p Monday -Friday. I just dispatched the drivers on where they were to pick up their next load from. A very easy job."
good,The job was alot of work i like it because it was a fast paced job i love the fast paced environments. The driver was great easy to work with. Would go back to work again
good,"I learn the hard way they don't hire seasonal driver, they will tell you if you do this or that you are probably gonna make it ,all BS. It's a Union Job go figure"
good,a typical day was face paced and routine...learning wise i learned how to build a efficient wall with boxes...as far as management crew trainers lacked the time to properly train the new recruits but other than that the hardest part of the job is being comfortable in the trailer that your building and then being moved to a new trailer without first completing the first overall its a nice place to work
good,"currently an unloader, lots of fun people to be around, very fast paced, filled with people who cares about your safety at all times, daily perks may be available to"
good,"As a Part Time supervisor had  job responsibility and new jobs to learn. With that there was always worked to be done, but being restricted on hours made job a bit hard sometimes to complete all the tasks needed. The pay for the responsibilities I felt was a bit low."
good,Ups is a challenging job that requires tough workers that are willing to carry 50lb boxes. Ups is a good environment for an easy fast going day. The employees are well trained and disciplined. Fast-pace is necessary for the type of work ethic that is required for a package handler position.
good,"Responsible for deliveries and pick up of packages and mail. Very reliable employer in terms of scheduling and wages. Always busy, and co workers are very respectful."
good,Great outdoors driving job. got to meet a whole neighborhood of people and develop great relationships. the most enjoyable part is being told how happy customers are to see you for delivering their packages.
good,"It can be pretty entertaining to just being interesting. Working with different drivers give it some variety. And, you get to control when you go in as long as you work with the company and communicate. I do not recommend this job to those who will take advantage of that for the wrong reasons, but it can be a convenient plus for those who will take it responsibly. Though, you do get dirty on this job, and you barely get a chance to wash your hands, so good gloves are recommended. Good, reliable transportation is recommended as you have to meet the driver somewhere on the route. And, make sure you take the chance to use the restroom when you get the chance. This job is always on the move and you won't always get a chance to use the restroom. The key to this job is communication."
good,"It is a quick-paced workplace. UPS, Inc. itself has good benefit and pay. The UPS Store is a separate entity from UPS, Inc.which can be confusing for most people."
good,I hurt my knee and couldn’t work as hard as I wanted to. I could barely walk so I could no longer run without being in excruciating pain. It is a very well paying job for someone who isn’t looking for a career yet but still wants to be paid well with decent hours.
good,A day at work is normal as usual.We start by going to peoples addresses and have their package delivered.I learned that it can be delivered different ways such as using a hand truck for support and heavy lift and also team work.The hardest part of the job is carrying a heavy package to an apartment building with no elevator.The most enjoyable part is getting a lunch break with your partner and receiving pay.
good,"Always room for growth. A great company for the career oriented. Always welcoming of staff suggestions, always willing to help teach new techniques.  fast paced environment."
good,"Room for growth, flexible hours and great benefits for the employee and the family. Your paid weekly, After working for 1 year you get your birthday off paid and the day after you receive holiday pay. during peak season overtime is great,"
good,Good place to work for. Has good benefits. Only full time employees make the real money. Eady to get hurt so follow the methods and safety guide lines.
good,"With this job, you must have the skillset to work with at least one other person because you will be helping a truck driver deliver packages all day. Be prepared to work in all types of weather conditions (rain, sleet, snow, etc.) Also be prepared to work at a very fast pace all day long."
good,UPS Is a fast paced and Challenging job. If you're unable to adapt to changing conditions on a daily basis you will struggle to achieve the goals. Although the tasks are difficult the management team is always looking for ways to help the hourly employees advance. There are clear signs of advancement opportunities for hourly employees into management.
good,After working at a Seasonal position at United Parcel Service I have come to see that its pretty good for what it was. The wage was good the people you work with are good as well. I enjoyed being a driver helper and being the one to help the driver deliver packages. I would help deliver at every stop and eventually would be challenged to take on big apartment complexes. Over time I learned how to manage my time and organizing my packages. The biggest challenges was delivering at night when it would get dark and also carrying some heavy boxes at times. Overall I enjoyed working at United Parcel Service and hope to work again during the next holiday peak.
good,"UPS is a good company in all over the world but in UAE now started but having equivalent customer like DHL"
good,"typical day"
good,This was a very fast paced work environment. Managers expected you to be able to pull the slack from other employees who didn't want to work very hard. This made a lot of people not try at all and make everyone else pick up the slack.
good,"Work at UPS is incredibly demanding physically; at least at first. Once you adjust to using the require muscle groups daily, it becomes gradually less strenuous. The culture is very casual, with no dress code in the hub beyond proper footwear, and the work sometimes tends to be a little mindless so the people in my area tend to be very friendly and talkative to pass the time. Management tends to be very hands-on."
good,Its fast pace and competitive and fun.Theres lots of room for improvement.And I like the benefits and they take care of there workers.They made me feel at home.
good,"I haven't worked here long but the hours are short, however the labor intensive. Wages they pay are meager but the benefits may prove it worthwhile in long run. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isnt willing to make it a commitment."
good,"Great overall work environment, Some floor leaders can be stressful and pressuring me to go faster even when I unloaded trucks faster than most people of my field, and it takes a long term of years to gain real incentives and pay increase.Discounts on businesses were great amd vending machine always made it so I could get sometging to eat even in a rush!"
good,"I was temporary seasonal help. It was very fast paced which made it fun for me. All of the people that I worked with were very much salt of the earth. Nobody played games, it was just about working hard."
good,"Was temporary seasonal work and the only real complaint I had was the lack of communication, during the class orientation we learned a bunch of things that were very specific but not things like how to check schedules, or the end date which was important because it ended up running into my class schedule"
good,I was placed in small sort whiched I loved some days where fast some where slow. My supervisor a good person which I am glad for. Though it was only seasonal and all the way in Oakland they provided transportation temporarily and they pay was good
good,"I would recommend UPS Supply Chain to anyone with the knowledge to complete the job.  People were great, as well as management.  I would still be working there if my job was not moved to another location."
good,"Did seasonal work during the Christmas holiday.  Fast pace work, worked long hours, earned time and a half pay.  Staff was welcoming, and friendly.  The drivers I worked with were helpful delivering packages.  Be carefully working in slipper conditions, many reported injuries."
good,"seasonal job was pretty cool, pick your own hours, and help the initial driver on routes. Most enjoyable part of the job is how laid back it was, if you got all your work done you could just go home."
good,"It's hard work at a fast pace, but UPS takes care of its employees and there are great opportunities available to those who choose to stick with the company."
good,"These ratings are based of a franchised owned UPS store."
good,"My typical day at this job moving packages through the supply chains solutions in United Parcel Service. What i learned is the large amount of parcel containing millions of items including plastic, metal, etc."
good,It was a comfortable environment to work in. Great people to work with offering a family like feel in a team setting. Hours were 8am-4:30pm monday through friday.
good,"I ran our centers safety committee for 50 drivers, witch involved reviewing injuries and accidents, and also helped train new drivers. In driver meetings gave demonstrations on how to work safely.  From there went on the road for deliveries and helped other drivers complete their day.    Time management.        Work place was all business.  The hardest part of the job was being away from your family for 11-12 hrs a day. Most enjoyable was the customers they were your second family!"
good,UPS is a great place to work. The company uses a balanced scorecard so management cares not only about their customers but employees. There are opportunities for advancement providing your skills match job requirements and they always look inside before exploring the open market.
good,I Loved going to work there and it had a few stressful moments but for the most part we worked together to get the job done. We had many deadlines to meet but we made sure packages where sent out and retrieved in the right time.
good,"In the beginning you have to prove yourself(40 days probation) And from what I have learned and heard from long time employees that 40 days can be very intense and take up to 3 months to get there(meaning,only when you're working do they count that as a day of work.Yes every day is different,you may not work 1,2 or 3 days even if you show up to work; there may not be work for the new hire; it's all about seniority."
good,"Great company lack of advancement opportunities at smaller hub I was located at. This is the reason I began looking for another job. Great benefits, best to stay union side and become a driver."
good,"I worked in Los Angeles in the Hollywood Hills and was the morning Driver Helper.  They used two Driver Helpers (morning and late afternoon) on this route because the route is very strenuous.   I usually got about 4-5 hours in daily, six days a week.  So for UPS there is an incentive to use multiple Driver Helpers if they have them.   From what I understand, priority for Driver Helpers can shift to full time Package Center employees who opt to work on what would otherwise be days off after about Christmas (and the decline in volume starts to allow it), who want to earn more money.  Again, this takes hours away from you, the Driver Helper and you have no control over the hours you work.  After 30 hours a week they have to pay overtime and UPS won't generally allow that in urban areas where they have a lot of applicants to choose from in a season."
good,"If you are willing to work extremely hard long physically demanding hours in the heat of summer and the cold of winter this job is for you. You will never experience an ""EASY DAY at WORK."""
good,Face pace working needed to get work done on time i learned how to use a dipad and had good recommendation from my driver. I had a lost in my family so that set me back a little bit but I'm ready to work now
good,I enjoyed my time at ups I started there co-oping and ended up there during my college experience. I still managed hours willing going to school fulltime.
good,"Handled al aspects of UPS services. Did LTL,TL Rail airfreight and small package. Ranked in the top 5% of sales force and achieved over 150% of quota on all services."
good,"the job is basic but the only thing that was to worry about was attendance, otherwise its is and you can move up in the job. You get benefits and union for being part-time."
good,"This is a fast paced job, you need to be physically and mentally ready. It's a fair paying job i think, and there is some oportunity to move up if you really dedicate yourself."
good,Es un trabajo que se mueve por presión y sobre todo tener varias opciones para poder determinar las necesidades y cambios de operativa constantes.
good,"To be able to withhold this job, you must have a very balanced life. Lots of sleep, and eating healthy is really important. Short shifts but very fast-paced especially if you're a loader. Non-stop loading packages into trailers."
good,"Long hours, hardly see your family during your career.Must be focused 100% of the time. Stay out of the rumor mill to be successful. Learn everything you can and you will do well."
good,"This job can become very hard during peak season, but what you will enjoy is that they have good security, and benefits such as Tuition program if your a college student."
good,"As a preloader you come into work and start working, packages come down the belt and you need to load the packages on to your cars in a set order for the drivers day. It is very fast paced and if you don't learn the methods it is very difficult. If you do learn the job it is incredibly easy and rewarding. It is physical as well and will make you feel you are at the gym everyday."
good,"Great environment.  I loved my team and shift! I enjoyed inspiring, motivating, holding each man accountable, and being the example of good character along with safe work ethics at work as well as at home.  Box Line 3 on PRELOAD in Dallas, TX was #1 in stats for at least 4 years straight!!!! I'm proud to say I only had 1 injury in my 7 years of management.  Thank GOD!!"
good,"I did not intend to leave UPS Freight however I was presented with a job opportunity that was to good to be true. "
good,"Great team I work for, but there is no advancement for me. I enjoy what I do, but I would like to focus on finding a position in the degree I earned  which is social sciences with a concentration in anthropology."
good,Great benefits. Decent pay. Job security. I've been a part time supervisor going on 10 years now and still haven't been promoted. It's time to move on.
good,Fast paced stable schedule workplace. Great benefits hard work physically demanding work. Consistent work athletic work team work hard work strenuous work
good,Working at UPS was definitely a growing experience. You are constantly challenged to adapt to different situations in a fast-paced manner. You learn to get a strong sense of time management and teamwork as you work together to get all the trucks ready for the morning.
good,"Go in and sort out the packages, I learned the value of recording information properly. The management was always supportive. The work culture was productive, because it was & is about helping each other. the hardest part of the job is having to stay extra hours until everything is finished. The most enjoyable part was coming in to the job and having the options to eat & enjoy breakfast."
good,"If you need a job to start off job, UPS is for you. However, the pay is really low. You'll be starting off 10.10 working 20 hrs a week. 4-5hrs a day. You can't live off this if you're living on your own."
good,Very physical job for anyone who is up for it. Allows for employees to work with something different each day. Great advancements for those who are willing to put in the work.
good,"At times it can be a little hectic to work here, but for the most part, as long as your focused, the work isn't that stressful. The most stress occurs when there are a lot of walk-in customers, but there are usually more than one associates helping out."
good,Owners are awesome to work with and the environment is welcoming. Good people who genuinely care about the personnel and customers. Great flexibility with time-off.
good,"Management was the only con to this job. It's a pretty solid job responsible for your own work, so if you mess up it's all on you. fast-paced you're most definitely going to sweat."
good,"The reason why I have lasted at UPS SCS for so long is because of my coworkers, they have become family to me. So caring, kind and really there for each other."
good,"Very high paced work, constantly moving or a least standing. Very physical. Everyone is very kind. Part time only allows for 10 min breaks which is inadequate for the workload."
good,"We load/unload the planes brought in for deliveries. Once you are assigned to a crew, there's a feeling of settlement as we all work to complete the tasks of the evening. Load/Unload takes considerable teamwork to get through the shift, safe and timely. I enjoy the teamwork environment and only wish the available hours matched the pay better. If you get to work 4 hours a night min. The pay is worth the work. UPS like to promote from within, so staying through slower times can be beneficial when full time or supervisor openings occur. "
good,I enjoyed most of my career with UPS.  The Company went through drastic changes that effected how they treated the customer and the employees.  A typical day had you chasing the clock all day long to maintain service commitments.  I learned how to deal with people and manage my time well.  The culture use to be a get it done attitude but the new changes along with the new generation of drivers turned it into a what can I get away with attitude.  Dealing with bad management was he hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable was seeing the faces of happy customers when they received their packages.
good,I generally delivered  parcels from 9-730. I interacted with customers on a daily basis. The job was highly demanding  and fast paced. I enjoyed being self reliable.
good,"is the great job of certain things personally? I can't agree on working for hours for 5 hours with only a 15 minute break thats really downsize and is really a total on the body, whether you are in shape"
good,"The pay and benefits are great. However, the job is very stressful. The hardest part of the job is handling multiple tasks at once. The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees."
good,"To be clear, I worked for a UPS store location which is different than UPS in general. It was good and flexible, but there were not a lot of benefits."
good,"You will be compensate with what you work for. Everyone has annual increase, but of course that will depend on your annual individual scores.........."
good,Leuk om lekker rond te rijden en steeds weer andere mensen te ontmoeten... elke dag is anders.
good,"My job was measured weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly."
good,"L'environnement de travail est très agréable, l'équipe en place très motivé et rigoureux, il y' a une bonne entente."
good,"Great job to enhance customer relation skills and how to up-sell products. "
good,"great benefits, maybe the best benefits you could have. very fast paced and competitive. Ups could be a lot better if it was production based or paid a little better. Also could use more hours."
good,typical day is when you get late delivery and mist pickup culture is good because people work together the most enjoyable part when every one at works
good,"It is a fast pace job if you don't like to get sweaty this is not the job for you. I learned a lot of how the process works at ups. The area supervisor where I worked at this warehouse could have been a lot better. They didn't know how to talk to the workers. The hardest part of the job was just how they would talk to you. I loved the experience and the knowledge of how everything worked but, mostly I really loved my co-workers they made it enjoyable to come to work."
good,"Great Training"
good,"working here really showed me what a fast paced job meant, there was little time for breaks, you had little space for mistakes/errors, i enjoyed and learning new things."
good,"This is a rating for The UPS Store. Great place to work, fast-paced and intimate work environment, Works like a machine when managed effectively. Most enjoyable part of the job is providing solutions to fit the need of the customer."
good,"Coming in I was told that the job was going to be very physically demanding and that we driver helpers were basically getting paid to work out.  I feel like that part was talked up a bit too much, but there might be some extenuating circumstances on my part that made the exercise quite enjoyable."
good,The workload it a lot. Management expects to much of one person. The benefits are some of the best i have ever had. I would recommend someone to work at UPS just to receive the benefits.
good,"UPS is great part time job to start out.  However, it is extremely physically demanding.  It is only about 20-25 hours a week, but it takes a tremendous toll on your body."
good,le chauffeur et moi nous avons des livraisons a faire tous au long de la journé .
good,"It was great as a seasonal job. Very fast paced. Good footwear is a must. If I am not employed soon, will go back.Perfect if you are looking for a seasonal pick up. It was very enjoyable."
good,"UPS is an outstanding place to work. However, you start off at the lowest position to see if your passion and goal setting mind really wants the ending result. Be fast!"
good,"UPS is a great job if you like physical exercise and hard work. It is not for the faint of heart. Long, hard stressful days (sometimes). Working out in the elements. Driving with the other crazy drivers. Its stressful, lots of deadlines and pressure. BUT, if you can overcome all that they reward you handsomely with excellent benefits and pay. This job is not for everyone, you either have it or you don't. Its somewhere you could make a career out of. You body takes a beating. Overall not a bad experience and I would recommend it."
good,Must keep up with fast pace immediately. Good pay. Many opportunities available for hard working individuals. Strong team atmosphere. Training provided. Strong safety standards.
good,"I wish there was more of an opportunity to advance in the company, you either have to try to move into supervision, which takes you out of the union and removes a lot or benefits, or hope for a full time opening that could take years to manifest."
good,"The benefits here are phenomenal.  I am part time but able to participate fully in the benefits package.  This is without a doubt the best health insurance out there and I pay next to nothing for it.  This is a huge organization so management is hit and miss but overall good.  Although my official title is Package Handler, I work at the airport and have been trained in many more specialized skills.  Even though we are working with millions of dollars worth of equipment, we are still classified as unskilled.  The pay does not reflect the skills and actual job duties."
good,"Sweatshop, favoritism, simple job, all labor, walls on walls on walls, Safety, safety, safety, allowed to listen to your music,  Union, "
good,"Lots of hard work, but you know you made an impact and got everyone's packages to them in a timely manner. I enjoyed working for United Parcel Service and would work there again, but as a driver."
good,was pretty good. I didn't love it but all i was doing was unloading packages from trucks so it got a little boring after a while. I was also myself for most of the work time.
good,Worked primarily in the downtown core delivering packages to both corporate and residential clients. Friendly work environment steady hours and benefits.
good,"Productive  and laid back work place.different age groups, very diverse.Has 24 hours security that are very friendly.Has fans for air and  heat.Has lockers for employees."
good,Decent place to work. Just need something more. Not seeing much advancement as of now.  Family oriented. Wonderful paid time off is a plus. Weekends and holidays off
good,"Getting my a work area setup"
good,UPS gives you opportunities to progress professionally if you are willing to relocate. there are many roles within the company so generally something to suit everyone.
good,"Unload/ sort packages out of trailer trucks. Try and reach a certain volume at a high demand. Learned the ins and outs of warehouse work. Management was fair and were trying to reach the demands of what upper management wanted from them, The culture sticks to the same routines and rules they have been doing for years. Hardest part is the strenuous work and heavy lifting. Enjoyable part the coworkers and the satisfaction of learning and growing in the company."
good,Great people to work with . extremely overbearing job if you're not physically in shape . Good pay Great hours I would love to work here full time one day
good,This company gave flexible hours to accommodate college students. Owner is very friendly and helpful. Learned endlessly about customer service and managerial duties.
good,"Very stressful and hectic"
good,Working for ups was fun while I was there. Provided a good workout while earning money. The people were fun to work with and were very welcoming to newhires. However shifts would contantly run long and communication was lacking to workers such as not telling me if I was working one day and wether or not I would be working the following days.
good,"The job itself is rather easy if you are fit and the pay is wonderful for college students. Communication between the center and you however is not something to be proud of and needs improvement. Also, if you are stuck with a not-so-nice driver, you're pretty mush SOL."
good,It's a good place to work to stay in shape.  Good job to have a little extra money.  Must like to get up early and work hard.  Great benefits and can be fun.
good,"Awesome people and benefits, very quick paced.  Roof for advancement but they do play favorites.  Great second job if looking to supplement income.  Drivers make excellent money."
good,The hardest part of this job is keeping up the pace. This job teaches you to be very detail oriented. It consists of lots of walking and heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet a lot of different people.
good,Great place to work with a great work-out and great benefits. Managemenr needs work not very helpful. Very hard to get in contact with Human Resources Department if you really need someone on their behalf.
good,"I sort packages from running belt to running belt, update clients' information, and process the broken or damaged package reports. I notify supervisor about the leaking or damaged packages."
good,"The position is flexible to fit your schedule. Management may lack some leadership development; therefore, advancement with the company is non-existent."
good,My day would start off really early which I liked and it was fast pace all the time. I learned when the job was done I could go home. The hardest was just keeping everyone on the same page to get the job done. I enjoyed being a part of a hard working team
good,mostly unloading trucks and packing trucks up then sorting out the packages. Need to be quick on your feet and hands but it not hard to get used to it
good,"The hours are unfortunately very short hence the pay reciprocates the hours, however I guess it makes up cause the benefits they offer you are very good. So its a easy quick job in exchange for very cheap and good benefits."
good,"Good Employer, learned postal and UPS shiping, manager is excellent and environment is low stress. Would recommend working for them, part time and full time"
good,My job at ups would be to scan each and every package that came down my belt and load them into the truck to where the packages wouldn't fall or be crushed during transporting.
good,A excellent place for those that wish  for part time to full time work. Decent benefits. Quick paced. Training is very good. Excellent amount of  work hours during the holiday season.
good,somedays are better than others at ups. I would say show up everyday with intent to work steady throughout the entire shift otherwise management gets frustrated.
good,"I was working as a preloader sorter, it was good just go there get the job done and leave. Early morning work I was doing. Once you finished what was needed for the day you get to leave early and great if you have a second job you can do for rest of the day for extra money."
good,"UPS is a good stepping stone for whatever you need, along with the connections you will make especially at a bigger HUB.  Because of UPS I do not fear finding a career later on in life."
good,"Fast paced"
good,No need for a gym membership. Extremely physically intense. UPS will help pay for college as long as you work there. Either early morning shifts or  early evening.
good,Received a bountiful amount of experience working for UPS in my early 20 to late 20s. Work can be stressful and so can management. Big resume booster if you promote within
good,"I enjoyed working for ups and the people of the company. However, the company didn't care about my health. I was laid off and unable to be a rehire due to surgery."
good,"This job is a great job to have especially as a student. Being a student during the day, you don't have too much time to work 9-5 shifts. The shift I work is overnight, so it is very helpful when my kids go to sleep as well. The pay could always be better for minimum wage. If they started me off above minimum wage everything would be great but I still have to work two jobs just to barely make it."
good,"Went to work as a car washer . Then elevated to package delivery man . Went into management and was assigned to Florence,Al. Was in charge of drivers and clerks for center operation. Went into Industrial Engineering to reroute centers to make  routes more efficient."
good,I enjoyed working here my drive was just too far. They have the best benefits you could ask for at a cheap rate. Wish I still worked there. They HR department is very racist in ATL. Will not hire whites.
good,"Good company, security, well managed. hard physical work, very hot and cold work at times.Good chances for advancement. Well paid and great benefits. job security."
good,this was a job where you had to be ready to work every minute that you are on the clock. It can be a job where all you do is your part and then go home or you can communicate with others while completing tasks.
good,"a typical day consists of walking the warehouse to the unload area where light calisthenics and stretching are required. When the sorting belts turn on, you begin unloading a truck as quickly, and as courteously as possible - being mindful of your teammates on the sort line and conscientious of the parcel itself - "
good,"The job was good, working with people. It was extensive and always moving. The only con there is was not enough hours but other than that I enjoy the job."
good,"This job is good because it helped me be physically active! There is a lot of work, often times not enough breaks, but good pay and caring employers. The overall vicinity was very good as well."
good,"It's a great place to work, I have enjoyed working here.  I've learned a lot from my manager and it is a great team environment.  The culture is great!"
good,If you can get through being a preloader and dealing with the supervisors harassing you long enough to become a driver the job is great. Offers good pay and great opportunity.
good,The hardest part of the job is the work / life balance.  The best part of the job is the development plan UPS has for everyone.  You can take your career as fair as you want.
good,I have been at UPS for 2 years and can say that it is a unique and expected experience. The hardest part of the job is that it can have long hours and possibly have a lot of challenges.
good,"It was a good company to work for not too many bad friendly supervisor. good work environment, friendly coworkers, the work was fairly easy, I always had a good time at work."
good,"This job was wonderful due to the fact that everything was business oriented. Working with every aspect of a small business made it a constant challenge, in a good way, to meet the different needs of various clients. Packaging and shipping was part of it while finding creative ways to market old and new businesses alike was what made this role so much fun. The day-to-day needs had to be met and you never knew what was going to come through the door - that was the creative side. Learning to listen to customers and presenting solutions within scheduled time frames was key to obtaining the best end product."
good,As a pre-loader at UPS your job is to load anywhere between 200-400 packages per package car(1-3 package cars) in a four hour sort. The culture of the work place is very team based. The hardest part is Mentally preparing for the sort at 03:45a.m.. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with genuinely nice and respectful people.
good,This job was only for the duration of 2 weeks due to the time that I was employed for the seasonal job as a UPS helper. Even thought the boxes varied in size and weight I found it not problem to deliver each package to its proper address. The pay was even more delightful sine I was paid thirteen dollars an hour. the only thing that I had an issue with was the traffic when I was driving towards my working area.
good,"UPS is great for college students or those who have other things going on on the side.  The medical, tuition and vacation are great."
good,UPSl was a wonderful company to work for. I had daily challenges at work and loved the people and the facility I worked at.  I enjoyed the customers service part of my job the most.
good,It's a good job. I only left for a local job where I could be home everyday. Most weekends all you was off for was 34 hour restart. I was on dedicated account so you make your delivery then deadhead back for another load.
good,"Being a supervisor at UPS requires one to have great leadership abilities. Everyday you are presented with a cost per piece plan that must be executed under some challenging circumstances. You are also required daily to observe and document employee behavior as far as safety, service, and performance, along with devising plans to improve those aspects daily."
good,As a business owner you have little time to spend outside of your store.  It is rewarding and well worth all the hard work and time you lose in other areas of your personal life.
good,pohoda klidek tabacek .. ziadne ponahlanie a takisto potom vyzera aj vyplata
good,"If you've got a gym membership, cancel it. You only work 4-5 hours per day, but they're a very physically demanding 4-5 hours. Excellent benefits considering it's apart time job."
good,"Great place to work, consistent freight, most drivers were easy to work with and alongside, the management section could use some new personnel. The most enjoyable part of the job was being on the road and delivering to the same customers over and over."
good,Very militaristic org structure and lacked flexibility to change quickly. Good job security and opportunities to advance. Good benefits and job security.
good,We handled packages and placed them in the right truck. Management could use improvement. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow. Great environment and friendly coworkers.
good,"early or late hours, great benefits, team work a must. scan packages, load packages in to delivery car. maintain all safety standards, while executing excellent customer service."
good,"building was fairly new, learned a lot about the postal business and how worldwide it really is. Management was people from different locations. Nothing was to hard about the job, very tedious if anything, very work friendly environment"
good,You can go far at UPS. It is hard work and you need the mindset that every shift will be difficult so there are no surprises. They are understaffed due to the Teamsters Union. The Union makes it so new employees are paid $10.00 an hour for hard labor and most end up quitting. You can climb the ladder and get a better position but I feel the Union creates too much friction at UPS. The Union advances people based on time.
good,"Good job, excellent benefits, work at your own pace, but sometimes can be very stressful with a lot of heavy lifting"
good,"typical warehouse work"
good,"Stretching before we start"
good,A typical day at this job was sometimes overwhelming due to the call volume. I learned about different route choices that the customers were able to choose from. Management worked as a team player when having different situations. The hardest part of my job would be the irate customers that hadn't received their packages on time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping and making customers feel good about chosing UPS
good,"It is a good company to work for, they (UPS) really tries to take care of their employees.  Some of the management styles can lead to a hostile work environment at times."
good,"Great place to learn a lot about the logistics industry. "
good,"The job is very labor intensive.  But you develop a close relationship with your co-workers.  You learn discipline and teamwork, because it takes the effort of every individual to get the job done."
good,"Non stop pushing, pulling, lifting and lowering of all types of weight. Seen a package up to 200 lbs and 135lbs commonly and ups is all about man power . Not very good equipment at my hub."
good,"Besides the belittling managers who steal hours from their workers if you don't pay careful attention to every hour you worked, the job itself was easy, sometimes stressful, but worth the insurance. The pay could have been better, but the raises weren't horrible."
good,"Overnight shifts are great, gives the day to live your life. There's great trainers to teach what's expected of you and the tasks are easy to pick up. From good performance you do have the opportunity to advance. Good work place."
good,This job was fun. I got to see a lot of areas I didn't really get to see.Saw a lot of animals to but the job I love because it was dealing with ppl n bring them there packages
good,"Working here is very physically demanding but after a few weeks of doing the job you get used to it.  The work environment is easy going, just put on your headphones and listen to music or a book and the day goes by quickly.  The worst part to the job is working at night."
good,just come prepared to put that hard work in. It's easy to flip burgers and stock shelves but when you come to the hub of ups you have to be ready to work
good,I have been working at UPS for 12 years and I am still employed part time. I have requested to be promoted to full time several times and they say I have not put in enough years. So full time positions for package handlers are hard to come by. The job is tough I  have to work under extreme weather but the benefits are great.
good,meet up with driver make delivers to different locations great workplace driver gives you a onsite on what will be done most thing i like about the job is that you have a consistent work schedule
good,"Everyday was a different day. Either it was a hard day or an easy day, not in between. The management was not all that good.The most enjoyable part about working there was when they would feed us after a hard week."
good,I love UPS and the people there. I mostly operate the forklift 75% of the time but also do some recieving and fix exceptions from time to time. The warehouse to work in itself is a bit depressing with the gray The pay is OK.. the healthcare is amazing.
good,"Did not work here for very long (was seasonal), but enjoyed the job and the people. The work was exhausting and there was very little praise, not really a con just something to be aware of before working here."
good,"UPS Freight is not like UPS Ground. The technology in UPS Freight is still years behind UPS Ground. Overall if you want a stable job where your seniority decides the amount of work load you do, then UPS Freight is the place for you."
good,UPS is a great place to work if your'e interested in benefits and chance for advancement. You would most likely start part time but have room to move to other positions.
good,Unloaded and loaded packages en route to final destination. Worked with some fun and dedicated employees. Job was physical and fast which keeps you in shape.
good,"Staying busy is the key"
good,"What can i say, worked there nearly 3 years enjoyed some what most of it but just needed to move of from it and pursure other careers if possible, so i left."
good,"Wish the supervisors would be a little more helpful with lower level employees. Great company for someone just starting out in the work force. However, be ready to put in a hard days work!"
good,"The hardest part of the job, was the first year.  Hard, sweaty, and very physical.  The second part was the most mentally draining, while delivering packages to several locations and addresses..  But the final job I had there was the most adventurous.  Driving through three states, in various weather conditions, with any number of moving or nonmoving vehicles with unknown experienced drivers"
good,"I worked as a preloader. Your typical day starts around 3-4a and you'll finish up at 9, when the trucks leave. Your only job is to load essentially 4 trucks with boxes. Much tougher than I thought, but I did come to enjoy it a little bit."
good,"Everyone starts at the bottom here, and that's good. Its a great place to work with amazing people and benefits. It will take about a year to become a driver if you start as a truck loader but its worth the wait, trust me."
good,"I get to work and set my area up. Pull out the smalls bin. Find totes for the drivers to throw their small packages into. Get bags to load my smalls in. I then grab the totes from the drivers and sort out all the next day I need to load up onto the plane. Scan and label and tape it on the bag so it doesn't come off and become lost. "
good,Fast paced and stressful.  You must be on your game.  This job is rewarding financially.  It is a job that will leave you feeling satisfied at days end of a job well done.
good,"I worked in the main distribution shipping hub in Atlanta, so that means I sorted packages and loaded trucks for delivery to other smaller hubs. The job is extremely physically demanding, and because it is a warehouse environment, you are exposed to extreme temperatures. "
good,"As a driver helper, the day usually started by getting a call by your local UPS office coordinator who would ask if you were available to work. You would then get a call from your paired UPS driver and meet at a convenient location to being working. The hardest part of the job without a doubt is the pace. Tons of stop and go delivering packages to houses with some being heavy boxes, and other being small packages. Despite the hard labor, I found the job interesting and enjoyable. Recognizing that it was a seasonal job, I do feel that the pay should be a bit higher, considering the labor required."
good,"ups is nice and simple usual routine everyday, during peak season a lot of hours. on those typical long out shift goes fast depending on the trucks. some people tend to slack off and give you more work to do."
good,"Great place to be if you can handle the work, cause its hard. Great great company, wonderful benefits. Tuition reimbursement, amazing health care, PTO, great union."
good,Working at UPS was a positive experience. The work was physically taxing but the environment emphasized safety to the highest degree. The benefits provided to me were exceptional and worth the work.
good,"I really loved the job at UPS, its just my back did not. The management and everything was great, my back just couldnt take the heavy lifting and beding up and dowm all day."
good,UPS is a culture that stresses detail and is very process driven. If this type of environment is what you desire it is a great place to work. UPS is also Stable
good,"Although you are given a substantial amount of hours, the work load is strenuous as you are running back and forth with packages that variate in size and weight between houses."
good,I pick and packed items. Also look up the orders to make sure that the whole order is complete and is shipped. I also help others that needed help complete orders
good,A typical day at Ups was to set up to get all trucks cleared in a time limit. What i have learned from working here is working at a fast pace.  My work rate increased. What i enjoy the most out of working here is clocking out after a rough day.
good,"ik vind mooi en gezellige werk, omdat ik werk bij UPS bijna 5 jaar"
good,"UPS has no room for slackers. Too many lazy folks but they all get weeded out thank goodness. "
good,"UPS is a very large company with a lot of employees. "
good,"i learned to work at a fast pace, and work with others. its a good work enviroment, and helped me out in a time of need. the bosses there were great.."
good,"Great job, hard work required daily. UPS has forced me to learn the value of completing a task down to the last minute detail. Management was laughably uninformed and consistently has unrealistic goals and expectations. The hardest part of the job is coming back in day after day when you hurt from toes to shoulders. The part of UPS I love is the freedom to dress, speak, and act with only minimal requirements of conduct."
good,Great place for a secondary job fast paced environment great staff very energetic good team player's everyone is nice and polite the pay was good great team great staff
good,"On your feet 99.9% of the time. Lifting and lowering packages."
good,Busy place to work. If you don't plan on moving or getting dirty don't apply. Not for the weak. Great daily workouts. Workplace environment is unique.
good,great company to work for and grow within. Statred young and grew with the company through many changes. Work life balance is the only issue I had as I got older.
good,Working at UPS was very ... how do you say controversial. One of my bosses was very rude and would say very mean comments to us. But I did enjoy the physical aspect of the job!
good,"A typical day at work consisted of riding in the truck, helping the driver deliver packages. Some packages required a signature, for whomever we were delivering them to. I would also have to help the driver pick up any packages that needed to go back the warehouse."
good,It's labor intensive it's also part-time with full-time benefits. The Teamsters make it worth it. They're the reason the benefits are awesome and there are 2 raises a year.
good,Working here gets a little heavy sometimes but you get used to it. I wouldn't get good amount of hours in order to maintain me and my family. Overall its pretty good if you want to become a driver but it takes time.
good,I was in the Plant Engineering Department.  It was very busy and there were very high expectations.  There were a lot of good people there in both management and non management.  The worst part for me was being on call 24/7/365.
good,"This was a great place to work at. My job was really easy and fun! I was responsible for loading and unloading ups aircraft. It was a fun experience to be around aircraft. I then transferred to driving a tug cart that pulled the cargo containers into and out of the aircraft and facility. Unfortunately it was a seasonal position, but I would apply there again. It was a great experience working there."
good,"This job is for a teeanger or young adult who works but is looking for some extra money. Above average pay, but not enough to survive on the check alone. great to advance inside of the company"
good,"UPS pays well but hours can be long. Supervisors can be annoying sometimes. You well need to work from Monday to Friday, for at-least 3-4 hours. you'll average around 20 hrs per week and get payed every Friday."
good,"good company to work for, steady work, new challenges everyday. Feel rewarded at the end of the day for helping customers receive there orders timely, client interaction"
good,"Work smarter and harder. When you think your done, your not.. Get back to work! I enjoy working for this great company. I never expect a easy days work and ready to face any challengs that comes my way."
good,"This particular job was just that a job. There was very little room for advancement."
good,You will earn every dollar on your check. The work was strenuous at times. I dealt with the aviation side of things. Benefits were great but very slow to advance.
good,"Honestly, I miss it to this day. I loved the interactions and the company can really be like a family. Here, I learned that your disgruntled customer is a person worried about their efforts being squandered. We all work hard and deserve fruition."
good,"over 100 years  histrorty , good system and net work in the worldwide. good communication with people"
good,UPS is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. A typical work day can be a bit stressful but the reward for providing e
good,"Great environment to work. Doesn't offer that great of benefits, which is my only real complaint. Management staff is good. Always need to be willing to adapt to change."
good,"Its not bad, cold days are freezing, hot days are insane. Your there till the work is done. Pay slowly gets better bur not great a first. Benefits are great for a part time position."
good,A typical would see me unload 2 or 3 35ft long trucks. I would also have to separate packages to be loaded onto trucks for delivery. As a driver helper I delivered packages to business and reidences.
good,"Early start hours but a good environment with regards to work mates. day to day the shift doesn't vary much at all, loading vans and unloading trailers ready for the delivery rounds. good pay rates and overtime hours available at busy times of the year"
good,"Great company with many opportunities to make a career out of. My experience had been good thus far, management can be difficult but the employees are very helpful"
good,Safety is a big concern at this company. Health benefits are excellent. Fast and quick moving environment. There are day and night shift jobs.
good,"Typical warehouse job, although with many more benefits. The other employees were generally good & fun to be around. Some supervisors were a pain to be around."
good,"This job was good, it just didn't fit with my school schedule. It takes alot of hard work and you need to be strong, and willing to put in the work."
good,"The UPS Store offered me a chance to work with different demographics with diverse backgrounds.  It allowed me to connect with clients on a professional and personal level, and learn and develop an appreciation of different cultures from different parts of the world."
good,"getting up a 3am until 8am, the management is good and the pay as well. They do not do that much training. Hardest part is how early they start but the pay is worth it."
good,I learned how to send packages off look up packages learned coustomer service skills I had good days and sometimes bad days complete my duties on somethings where slow so nothing to do at sometimes
good,"-Typical day includes scanning about 5,000+ packages. memorization of workplace procedures for different area codes."
good,It was a fast paced job  with cool employees for the most part. How learned barcode scanning and how to sort boxes faster. The warehouse was very organized with it's sections. The hardest part about the job was my worl schedule. I lived nearly 2 hours away from the warehouse and I had to be there by 3 am. The most enjoyable part about the job was that the cafeteria there served delicious food some people there was fun to work with.
good,"always have something to do, simple job,great management, very nice work place. i enjoyed meeting nice people. always different, wasnt a typical day at work."
good,Since I was a driver jumper I didn't have set hours everyday and sometimes I was never called back to go into work but when I did it was always a joy to work all the drivers.
good,"A typical day at work is a nice but hard working day. I learned how to manage new hardware. The management is decent, overall i liked it. The work place culture has a variety of different types of people and activities to do. The hardest part of the job honestly is just standing all day if your a processor. The enjoyable part is the breaks as everyone will say, but personally i enjoy meeting new people."
good,"every day was very busy"
good,Being that i was a part time worker the crew and Management team treated everyone with the up most respect. People who work there really care about the company and did what they could to make it a great place to work
good,"A typical day at work would involve going to the hub to get the truck and start heading towards our routes. Depending on how many packages you have to deliver and if there are any missloads you may have to contact another driver for some trading of packages. After organizing the truck into nicely organized shelves, we would go about our route and make sure every package is off the truck by time."
good,"I loved this job, working very long hours, very physical and demanding work, making up to 200+ deliveries a day.  Not a fan of the supervisors or upper management.  NO communication abilities what so ever, like in their packing and loading division."
good,"I really like ups they treat you with the up most respect and the workers there are very friendly and respectful. It's a really nice way to easily make 170,180$ a week starting off"
good,Great company to work for with good benefits when working for 1 year. Fast pace work with little rest. Must be a hard worker to work for them
good,"Worked the Package Handler Shift as a seasonal temp. The work is generally part time except for holiday season. Good for early morning risers (typically shifts work from around 4 to 8 AM). The work is fast paced so you need to work fast and be able to lift 75+ pounds. During peak other temps kept leaving, so handling the increased workload was difficult at times. Communication between area managers was not always the best, but they are helpful at the individual level. The pay is good and it comes with benefits for part timers after about a year on the job."
good,"you come to work at about 3:40am have a talk as a group with the supervisor on how the day should go. then you go to your duties weather that is unloading volume, sorting packages, working with the jets, driving a tug, or loading the trailers. then after the initial sort is finished you go out to load smaller aircraft and marshal plains out to the tarmac. then head back inside and clock out. it is about a 3 hour shift Tuesday through Friday. on occasion you may work Saturday at a later time depending on seniority. "
good,"Great company to work for, professional management, good pay, excellent benefits, can be difficult to advance in the company for some. Part time work is VERY part time (3-4 hours a day). Equal opportunity for advancement (based on seniority). However, difficult process to get into full time driving."
good,Be polite and respectful to customer's. It's a nice place to stay in once you've been able to get a job their. If you're looking for stability this is the best place to be.
good,"Job consists of repetition and physical labor.  You work in the cold during the winter and the heat during the summer, building is not climate controlled."
good,Good place to start off your career if your young with no responabilties. Also a great career if your are trying to drive money wise an is a place for growth.
good,Very active work with great drivers to work with. Long and cold hours but it was a valuable experience. I did enjoy being active every day delivering packages to people and loved seeing the smiles on the faces of clients when receiving their packages
good,This is a great starter Job and if you  continue on with the company there is a great  opportunity for advancement. This job is a fast pace job but you don't have to worry about very long hours.
good,There is definitely a UPS way of doing things. The company asks a lot of it's people and if you don't like hard work this is not a place for you. Service is what UPS offers and service is never easy. I have learned to keep moving and always stay busy because that is how you get things done working for this company.
good,". Bonne ambiance "
good,its a fast and productive work place with great co workers and understanding manager 12 hr shifts and love they let u gather a lot of overtime
good,I've been here for almost 3 years and I've pretty much appreciate all of the benefits they have to offer. I plan on moving up and growig within the company as well.
good,"They pay you pretty well, the only problem is that its a seasonal job, so it doesn't last, but it was great for the extra income"
good,There are many different ways people always want to know how there packages are being packaged. As a package handler i was able to learn about different methods into packaging a certain item and knowing which material to use to protect the item from any damage
good,I was lucky to work with fun and dependable co workers and owners. It was overwhelming at times (especially around the holidays) but with the right co workers you will be fine.
good,Overall a great place to work.I am currently looking for something different.I would like to work in a company where i can move up.
good,"Daily work schedules focus on completing proper package sort for timely shipping and delivery targets.  There are different departments that handle all facets of package sorting depending on service level, size, hazardous materials handling."
good,Hard work with flexible hours. A good team building environment with friendly co-workers. Moving up the ranks a possibility. Physical work that is tough on the body overtime.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is actually getting to know all the different peoples I come across and interact with. I've learned that you are accountable for your own responsibilities.
good,the job is not that bad u have to do the same thing over and over again you always start part time you get ten minute break. i dont know what to say so im just typing in random thins
good,"At UPS you need to be a very hard worker. Many people think they can do the job but upon hire, quit after a couple weeks. If you stick around you can acquire phenomenal benefits and raises. The hardest part about the job is the beginning. Even for the most conditioned athletes it can be taxing on the body. If you can make it through one year it'll basically be second nature and you'll be set as long as you stay safe and make good work choices from the beginning. Management will fight for the ones who work hard for them. They want to keep the hard workers. During my time there I was able to build a lot of friendships and work my way up rather quick. Their benefits are unmatched in my opinion and there is good job security."
good,As long as you are open to change and work hard than working here is a good job to have from my experience. The breaks are short but so are the shifts. They also promote moving up from with and pay for your schooling.
good,As long as you work hard and keep focus you can advance in the company. I learned a lot here the training is very good as well as very good benefits.
good,"loading up truck, doing a 1000 miles a day starting at 8 am getting done at 7-9 pm depending on the number of packages. Management gave us a pep talk everyday before we left. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find the house. I liked being out side all day  ."
good,Good jobs that provide good benefits. Job security is not very good but there is good management and a good company. Generally unload 3 trucks of packages which makes a little fast paced but there are people there to help you if you need. The hours are good for anyone looking part time.
good,I loved this job I would still be working there if it wasn't for my relocation. I just feel that after being there for a few years that I would have gotten a lot more recognition.  I loved the work environment though.
good,Great place to work and get promoted lot of job opportunities new people to be met like I said I've been promoted my first 30 days but I'm still a supervisor right now looking to move up in the company as well
good,Night shift schedule. Not good for my health. The workforce are fairly young and competitive. Company focused in training and development of workforce.
good,"For a seasonal paycheck, it was great. But the hours were horrible and the job was hard labor.  Full time is hard to come by and I was too tired to be with my kids."
good,"UPS is a good place to work with competitive salary, fix day off and know how take care of there employees. The place is nice the equipment are nice to they will provide the training that you need so can be competitive and productive"
good,"Responsible for the physical loading, unloading and/or sorting of packages by hand, including lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying and placing, in a safe and efficient manner."
good,Able to learn lot of new technologies and skills.Very good work environment. friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job is A participative style.Its an open-door method of managing in which you get things done by motivating people and delegating responsibility
good,"It's almost like you get paid to work out. You'll be sore your first week or two using muscles you never knew you had, very repetitious work but decent job overall"
good,"was a well productive environment to work in, being able to build skills. meeting new people and being able to adapt to new and different working conditions."
good,"ability to move objects from one freight to another in an timely matter. great service and quality, wouldn't work for company in future endeavors, simply because of the extreme labor."
good,"Working for this company has been the learning experience of a lifetime. I am the middle man so to speak in connecting people with jobs and offering life changing opportunities. Its a team work based environment, everybody must pull their own weight but at the end of the day working together has made us successful."
good,There is a effective way to have people jumping into trailers back and forth continuously without overworking them. But I must say that it is physically demanding it is also a success when you finish the work.
good,"Most of my career I have worked for UPS. I started my career with UPS on Application development,  then I moved to San Diego, CA for family reasons and started working here as QA Manager. Overall it is a great company to work for."
good,It's ok it could be a lot better but it's a job so I won't complain. Out of all the jobs I liked cardinal hill the most.. the only bad thing about job was they didn't give raises
good,Overall it's just a factory job.  There are ways of moving up but the loading can be hard going on the body. The are days where over time can be too long. But you can do the twilight shift which is suppose to be a lot easier.
good,"Great work environment, great leadership within the company. If you are willing to work hard and do what is asked of you then there is no reason that you can't work your way up within the company."
good,The owner of the franchise is very considerate of assoicate's needs and is frequently present on site. The monthly schedules can be very flexible when enough employees are available. The managers work diligently on granting requested days off and having shifts covered. Training is more casual yet professional. Overall scheduled hours can be cut with short notice during slow business.
good,Ups innovations warehouse was a great place to work great place of employment. They have a way of letting you know that your apart of the team.
good,got a chance to get know a lot of new people throughout the  hospital always had something to do never a dull moment.  Most co workers were pretty cool.  Some had to learn to pace themselves to avoid over exertion.
good,"Good environment to work in, fun place. Wear and tear on the body, a very physical job, but it gives you a sense of accomplishment to exceed. most enjoyable part is finishing loading up a truck knowing you are done."
good,"The company is great to work for. Mainly go in, work, then leave. The job can be very physical and demanding but I look at it like I was getting paid to workout. "
good,"Working the early morning preload sort allows me to have a regular day after work. We work everyday but there are times where we start earlier than usual."
good,"This is a excellent job to learn about working as a team to achieving the required results. The benefits and compensation are okay for the job. You will have bosses, co-workers, and employees of all ages, that can be difficult to some at times. Ex. My first year working at UPS as a part time sup at the age of 19, I had a 30+ employee that did not taking orders from a teenager. From that I learned that while being in management you don't have to make friends, you have to hold people accountable to doing there job."
good,"Excelente empresa"
good,Empresa tradicional com bom ambiente de trabalho porém sem perspectiva de crescimento.
good,"If you can handle some graphic programs include Indesign, easy to get a job and also having a big smile. "
good,UPS is a culture more than a company. One dedicated to safety and the customer. Fast pace result driven environment with rewarding feeling at end of the day.
good,I learned excellent time management skills. how to thrive in a social environment. fun activities on some days. celebration of holidays (e.i christmas) and birthdays.
good,"excellent management who always tries to help "
good,"Hard, sweaty work. Learned that hard work goes a long way. Management was more worried about numbers than their employees. Most co-workers were unmotivated and incompetent. The hard part is the amount of strength and labor put in. I enjoy the hard work and keeps me in shape."
good,Working at UPS on a typical day is a fast-paced work environment with constant changes. I learn new things everyday about operations and functions of the company. The management work very hard but could have better communication. The hardest part of the job is that every management person has their own opinion on how things should operate instead of one set system for all. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to reach out to the community through volunteerism with UPS.
good,Great job but you don't see your family much. Time to enjoy the holidays around Christmas is non existent.  Unrealistic expectations of production.
good,I started this job in Nov of 2013 as a temp in the truckload brokerage division. After several months I applied for the accounts payable position and got it. I have thoroughly enjoyed working the positive attitudes of my co-workers. When UPS bought Coyote Logistics my position was no longer needed and I applied for the pricing analyst position. I have been doing that ever since.
good,I learned how to operate different machine properly and safely. You get to meet and work with different people. Unloading and loading planes was fun. You get a lot of down time. Crew members and supervisors worked together.
good,"Store location with mix of busy and slow times, managed own time, and worked without supervisor. Did mailbox rental agreements, claims, and specialized packaging/shipping."
good,"Reputable company to work for. Amazing environment to work in, possibility to work from home. Hours are flexible, good benefits. The team and management are supportive."
good,"A typical day at UPS was loading trucks for 4 hours, having a 10 minute break, then loading for another 4 hours until the shift was over.I learned more about how our mail systems work and the legalities surrounding it. The management at UPS was very nice, helpful and well run. My coworkers were good people and great workers. The hardest part of the job was the constant moving, and heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and knowing I was with a good company."
good,"- typical day: sitting at cube, working, eating at cube, talking to coworkers during breaks"
good,The Working conditions are to be desired and its all determined on the temperature outside and the employees are always angry. Also leads to back problems if you do the slightest thing wrong
good,"I learned how to break down pallets and stack."
good,"A typical work day for me is very hot because there is little to no air flow in the building. Extremely tiring because majority of the week we are short staffed. Plenty of call outs because employees feel they are backed by the union. Management easy to talk to but, too lenient on poor attendance and tardiness. Co-workers are cool but I do not take any relationships past work.The hardest part of the job is having to compensate for call outs and co-worker tardiness. It makes this physical job much harder. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that your day will be over within four to five hours."
good,It was a decent place to work. The conditions eould get pretty bad but they let is get water breaks to hydrate. They're a good conpany for they're benefits.
good,"A typical work day is being able to work with people that care for there job and work hard. I prefer working as a team so no one falls behind in production. I like learning new things everyday, might takes  a few tries to fully understand it but will catch on very quickly. I like having a relaxed and understanding management but still get's all our work done on time. Co-workers are relaxed but ready to start the day off. My hardest part of my job is being treated like a little kid and being treated like It's my first day, and getting off work a lot later than needed. I don't mind working late but knowing the job could have been accomplished a lot sooner is irritating but tolerable. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting off work and knowing I put my all in my work and take the pride that I did the tasks given."
good,The compay has great benfits. The employees are good to work with. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy packages at a fast rate.the best part of the job is fueling trucks.
good,Warehouse environment with helpful associates to get the job done on time. The longer I worked the better my skills became with working with different size groups to get big or small trucks done properly and on time. I feel that opportunity to move up to a better position should have been more open for those who seek better opportunities.
good,"You will learn a lot about yourself as a person, worker, and leader at UPS.  The job is very rewarding and personally fulfilling but tough at the same time.  The compensation and benefits are in line with what is expected of you."
good,"Everyday you get excited to go and start the work. I have learned and developed my confidence, flexibility in adopting multicultural individual, time management and decision making. This also helps me guide my path in career advancement. I have not found any hardest part of the job my experience. Although, stress is always part of working but the best thing is that I enjoyed working in this company with its people al the more."
good,"UPS is good company to work for. If you choose to work for them seasonally or make a career of it. There are many opportunities for management position,package handler, and drivers."
good,working here is simple for the most part. I was an unloader and besides the issues with machines that assist in unloading it was just hard work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at ups is being around airplanes, the hardest part of the job is stacking packages inside the airplanes, my co-workers are outstanding people to work with, my management isn't the best very unprofessional, I learned how to stack boxes inside a airplane and a normal day at ups consist of lifting and lowering, stacking, and scaning boxes."
good,"This job is provides great benefits after a year but will provide for college tuition reimbursement immediately upon starting work. Loud environment, somewhat physically demanding, and a warehouse environment. I would recommend for those looking for long term work and advancement or for college students looking for tuition assistance."
good,I really enjoyed the ability to work hard and move up with in the company. I also liked working for. such a well respected world wide company. The benefits were great.
good,"The job was ok, the hours suck and the managers was rude and dis respectful. and the environment was not the best i stayed a year until i found something else."
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee around the Holiday season as a package handler and also as a driver helper. The hours were weird and at times difficult because I was doing both of those job titles throughout the season. Package handlers unload, sort, and load packages onto specific trucks for delivery. The work is fast paced and physical. Driver helpers ride around in the trucks with the delivery drivers and deliver packages to businesses and houses. Most of the other workers were very friendly and pleasant to be around. The hardest parts of the job for me were the odd hours and delivering packages in icy, cold temperatures. The most enjoyable parts of the job were cracking jokes with other employees, the freedom to move about, and not being stuck behind a cubicle or computer all day. Also, we had weekends and holidays off."
good,"A typical day at UPS consist of coming into work, having a pre-shift where production, accompliments, and moving forwards goals are discussed. After leaving from pre- shift employees then proceed to obtain a forklift. A six point check is preformed and if need propane tank change then they are changed. After preparing your forklift then you go to the cell at which you are greeted by management and giving a load. Load count range from two bill on trailer to sixty plus bills on trailer. You are to scan, reweigh, and audit package accordingly to guidelines. Being part- time generally the work day consist of six hours. This company has advanced me on skills in management. I am very knowledge about how important procedures and policies."
good,"Enjoyed working with multiple talents people over there"
good,"Great benefits after 1 year of working"
good,I'm not sure if this review is going to mean much since the site seems to think I worked with UPS but I really just worked at a privately owned storefront franchise which is different. I enjoyed that every day was a different kind of job because different projects would come in. The work is pretty stressful though because there is a very low margin for error and you are held accountable.
good,"The job I had at UPS was a good job.  I liked it, but it was just part time, and it is really hard to get on fulltime there..  The management is not that bad, they are fair."
good,my typical day at ups was come in ask my supervisor where he would like to assign me to. then i would go an began the task assign to me. the task was usually sorter or loader or what ever i am ask.my co-workers were  pretty nice.being that it was a fast paste environment had to multitask and stay focus. the hardest part at first was getting used to the 3rd shift staying awoke. took getting used.
good,I was only with UPS for a couple months as a seasonal driver but enjoyed working with the company.  The Other drivers where very helpful when I first started.
good,While working to Tyrrell Prison Work Farm there was little to no air in the inmate living area so the officers would be hot. Overall the benefits was excellent.
good,"I was always on the go, running boxes around and avoiding being bit by dogs. I wish I would have had more human interaction besides with my driver."
good,"If you want to lose weight, get reasonable pay, really good dental and medical benefits, and don't mind the box dust, being a package handler in a UPS warehouse is a pretty good gig.  The hours start early for preload shifts but then you are done early.  They paid weekly and if you live in a right to work state your Union dues are optional.  However being in a Union attracts very annoying workers who refuse to step up if they know a task is not strictly required of them."
good,My experience with ups was not bad but it is hard work aspascally starting out. I helped train a lot of people mainly because management has a very high turn over rate. People got along pretty good although the stress level was high. All in all it is usually worth it to stick it out.
good,Great for someone who has another job and can use this job for the benefits. Best part here are the benefits. Hard physical work.
good,"As a typical work day as a unload-er working for UPS is very sweating and tried for only three and half hours. Only net pay is 165.00 every each week. What i had learned that nobody, nor a human been could live off of twenty hours a week. The hardest part of this job is unload three fifth three feet truck in with in three and a half hours that the hardest part of the job. The most most enjoyable part is been off."
good,"custodial maintenance  strip and wax ,carpet wash ,clean windows, clean restroom,clean office and trash buffing moping for the 5 buildings every day."
good,My day usually started with log into CMS proprietary OS for company that lets you gain access to shipping tools and management functions. Greet clients welcome them to our business and provide them with great customer service with anything they needed to get done that we accommodated. Coordinate with Multiple carrier services on pick up and drop offs of packages for clients. Work and operated cash register tally all funds.
good,In the year and a half that I have worked for UPS I have learned many skills. From customer service to faxing I have become efficient in dealing with high stress situations.
good,"UPS has a very good environment with amazing people to work with. I load trucks and sort boxes into trucks and loading trucks is the least enjoyable part of the job. You get dirty, bruised, and its a tiring job you are constantly moving. You get a 10 min break and then right back to school. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
good,"starts at 2:30 Am until about 8:00 am. manages team of employees. Learned a lot about organizational and time management."
good,I go to work and i usually get about 4 hours a day. it is a good job when it comes to benefits but as far as supporting your family you have to be there many years to get high pay. it is a progressive pay scale and its not easy but if you tough it out it might be worth it.
good,UPS management is supportive It is a tough duty to handle huge warehouse and half million of packages every day. I learn time management and manage to find packages within and out of such a huge warehouse.
good,Working for United Parcel Service was one of the best jobs have come across without needing a four-year college or university. The compensation for your work is excellent and the benefits are extraordinary.
good,"I currently work for UPS. they have a great union that will fight for you to the ""tea"". Overall it is a good company but because you start off as a part-time worker you only get 2 1/2 to 3 hours a day 4 hours a good day."
good,As a pre-load crew member we unload and load trucks and sort packages. With the management changes over the last six months it has been a huge spark in morale and productivity. It is physically demanding but also rewarding as it keeps you in great shape.
good,"Each day you must be extremely organized and conscious of time. the job is fast paced and requires the ability to be versatile. Constantly changing weather and traffic conditions require you to plan ahead, and think on your feet. Management is knowledgeable and well equipped to help when there is an issue where the driver doesn't know what should be done. The Co-workers are all usually team players and are willing to help with dispatch issues. Extreme weather conditions ans stress were the most difficult challenges. and the customer interactions were the best part of the job"
good,Unloaded trailers and some of the things that I learned at UPS was how to pick up very heavy bulk how to sort the mail memory has to be on point. The management at UPS was alright wasn't the way it should of been a lot of workers didn't stick to the guidelines. My co-workers were some of the best people i worked with. Only hard part about that job was the bulk i had to deal with. The best thing about that job was when I got paid.
good,"The work is very easy and repetitive, the thing that makes the job enjoyable is the people I get to work with. The owners of the store changed last summer and the new ones have improved the quality of the store and the experience."
good,It's not so bad overall it's what you make it. Not everyone is fit for it -- however I would say it would require quite abit of tolerance and endurance.
good,"The most important part of the job was being able to work around others without the pressure of management hovering over your head. I didn't like the lack of essential work place needs for employees such as; working water fountains, and air conditioning/heat. I learned the basics of how the delivery and mailing companies operate. The hardest part of the day was the physical work."
good,"If you are willing to work hard this is the company. they take pride in"
good,I enjoy kids and watching them develop into the person there going to be. but aiding them and guiding them in that process is also something i enjoy because i didn't get that as a child.
good,"I enjoyed working for ups and I'm honored to have had the opportunity to work there , Ive also learned a lot of new things working for ups"
good,"A typical day at UPS as a package handler...your start times vary between 12-4 and can end from 8-10 depending on the time of the year. The workload can also vary from light to heavy depending on the time of the year. You basically carry packages off a belt to your trucks and often roll heavy packages into the trucks. I learned about safety, work ethic, and stress management during my time with UPS. The management was very helpful at times. The supervisors will assist you and converse with you. The manager is very caring and will help you with any problems you have. My co-workers are a different story. Like any company, there are always the lazy and the hard-working employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the workload at times such as during peak season (November-January). The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that it's a very honest job. You have to work for every cent you get and you get to meet a lot of cool people."
good,The job job is fast pace and technical. Very competitive when it comes to production numbers and quality of customer service.
good,Over the phone telemarketing surveys.  Call people and try to convince them to do an interview over the phone.  This was before cell phones were in every household.  I remember sending packs of cigarettes to survey participants for market research.
good,people are so much fun to work with. Everyone has the same opinions of the job and so-so attitude. But it was enjoyable to work there but there was a lot of dis function and low communication.
good,"I like the job a lot. It has a lot of potential to possibly be a job i keep till I am in my 30s or 40s. The job descirption should tell you alone how a typical day at work is. You come in, clock in, strech, and moving boxes in and out of trucks."
good,"UPS is a decent company for the most part, they just have very unreal expectations and have a crazy job culture. They have you supervising but the people who are suppose to be of help don't help you. You don't get a real break. No real room for advancement."

good,"getting up early lifting boxes loading trucks before they left to make there deliveries. Ive learned to be urgent, safe, and lift boxes properly. Management is terrible i'm not speaking for everybody that was a manager. UPS hired just about everybody so you will have people that were managers but didn't like certain people. It was like being in High school all over again. they always hired people to be supervisors but never truly ever had to load or unload a truck. I've noticed there would be a lot of disrespect amongst each other as well as physical confrontations. I never found anything hard about the job maybe the hardest thing was building walls in the 18 wheeler trucks. the Most enjoyable part about the Job it is a great workout and be sure you drink a lot of Water"
good,UPS. is a fun place to work. but very hard to get on full time. Some of the hardest  part about the job was some of the package was very heavy.
good,Demanding job physical and mentally.Good work atmosphere.Management willing to work with employees needs. Team effort is needed along with good safety service and performance to be successful.
good,Good job the hours just didn't work well with my other job. since UPS was 3-8 AM. But overall not a bad place to work. They also offer decent compensation and benefits.
good,"Management is not the best to work with, but benefits of the job make it worthwhile. Sometimes workload is very heavy to handle in the short amount of time given."
good,"This is my first job. I really liked working there, but they would not give me a raise until after I worked one year there. I would've stayed there, if it was closer for me to drive to."
good,"A very high paced, laborious job that is rewarding in being physically fit and receiving great benefits.  The hours take time to get used to, but can be worked around school or another job."
good,It was nerve-wracking every single time i came in. A lot of pressure was on me because of the timing. The hardest part about this shift is that it asked too much for a short amount of time. My co-workers were awesome and coped with me on a friendly level.
good,"-good work environment "
good,"I learned the day to day operations at the UPS airport hub, inside and out. Working during the holiday season, or peak as they call it, was difficult at times. Some of their packages were extremely heavy and even needed several people to help lift them and load them into the truck or canisters to be placed on the planes. However, for the most part it was a friendly atmosphere where the supervisors and the employees all depended upon each other. I really hated that it was a seasonal job and had to end after the holidays, I liked having the experience working, the only downside is it was 2-4 hours a day so it would never be enough to support a family on."
good,Active and fast pace work place. On a regular busy day i would take heavy/irregular packages from one platform to another
good,The job is simple but you have to be able to keep up with a very fast pace and heavy lifting. I learned how to work fast and steady at the same time to prevent any jams or delays in the work flow. Management does a good job at making sure everyone is where they need to be and doing their job to keep the flow moving. The toughest part of this job was the consistent heavy lifting for hours straight.
good,"Hard worker. work with minimal supervision, good customer service and get along with others overall.  Excellent personality, work well with others and communicate well with internal and external."
good,"A great place to start a career, insurance and other offered benefit packages are great. There is room for growth but they are now requiring a degree."
good,"2-8 hour days, hard but steady work. co-worker was great but the tech we used was a bit dated and difficult to use. no real management needed. best part of the job was getting to be outside and active."
good,"Preparing and maintaining accurately the CBA ; issuing invoices"
good,My typical day at UPS is teaming up with an unloader for the entire day. I follow him to his trailer and sort all the packages he sends on the belt to me to the correct belt according to the label. I enjoy talking with fellow employees. The management team is outgoing and I like the open door policy we have with them all. The hardest part of my day would be to constantly lift packages up to 70 pounds with only one ten minute break. Overall UPS is a great company to work for. You have to chance to change positions and/or move up in the company in little time.
good,"A typical work day for me is tackling a different task every time I step foot in the door. I learn something new everyday. My manager is very fair when it comes to certain problems. I get along with all my co-workers, we are like one big family at times. The hardest part of my job sometimes is shift change because i would love to stay on the clock. The most enjoyable part of my day is leaving the job knowing that i satisfied my customers and took care of business."
good,Mucha dedicacion en los primeros anos que UPS se instalo en la Argentina
good,You are constantly on the go. It is a fast paced environment where you are always moving and staying busy. I learned a lot of things about this particular trade.
good,Not a super hard job just really hard on your body. It was good hours though I loved working 4-10 everyday it was perfect with my school schedule.
good,My personal experience is good. My supervisors are nice I don't really have any hard times over there unless it's peak season due to the amount of loads. Physical work is no worry to me. Just do what you're there for and you should be fine.
good,"The job is very fast-paced but it starts off slow then as the night progresses the flow of voulume begins to pick up,ive been there for 7 years without any major injuries because of the methods that i was trained on and thats pretty much the key to being successful there and always keep a positive mind set because there will be days that certain things or people will get under your skin,so keep it cool and follow the methods that they train you on and you will do just fine."
good,"Everyday we work as a team to successfully send countless packages to their destinations. I have learned to determine myself, and keep everything organized while getting the job done. The management was cool and understanding and the co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the soreness days after working."
good,My typical work day was rigorous. I had to delivered all parcel regardless of weather conditions. I learned as be more organised and how be more systematic.
good,"Its the same as any other warehouse job. Its more of a stepping stone than anything. Its meant to get you through school, and beyond that the people that make a career out of it are either felons or drug dealers looking for part time work"
good,I enjoyed working here because I was on the move a lot. Made stuff get done. My Co worker explained to me what to do at the beginning while things were rough. but I'm a fast learner.
good,"I loved working at UPS.  It was a fun environment to work in.  I started working there young, so I made a lot of lifelong friends there.  UPS is a very stable company to work for."
good,"I loved this job. It was only seasonal so that was a bummer. They gave a good amount of hours, we would do deliveries all day. The staff was great. It was fast paced when it came to loading trucks and making the deliveries which was actually great. Time went by so quickly."
good,"Fast paced job that usually includes supervisors doing hourly work. There is room for promotion, promotions are given to minorities first. Benefits are terrible and getting worse every year. Its not what you know, its who you know. Supervisors are required to where pants in 100 degree heat and expected to do hourly work while wearing the pants."
good,"Help start sort line and load the truck. Learned how to work as a team, and packing. Able to work with little to none suppervision. Enjoyed the enviorment and that there was always something to do."
good,"- Great benefits, very competitive pay rates and the people there are really cohesive."
good,"getting to work with a lot of people new friends hard work. ive learned you don't get get paid by the box its by the hour. management is ok , co-workers are great the hardest part of the job is when the packages overflow you have to go 10 times harder the most part I enjoy is the co-workers and new friends."
good,Empresas multinacionales muy buen trato se trabaja bajo presion
good,"Friendly environment."
good,Manage operation and enforce rules and production throughout sort. Daily meetings and quotas to meet. Logistical planning and control of areas and stations.
good,"Typical shift would have me meet my driver at my assigned meeting place ( some driver helpers were assigned a specific route, my assignments varied by day.) And we would have the packages ready according to the route. Some days we would have a moderate load, but usually we had a large amount to deliver ( it was Christmas season, busiest time for delivery companies). There was always a chance we would not be able to stop for our lunch, so I learned very quickly to pack a lunch."
good,"A typical night in my case is busting your butt the whole 4 hours I worked, Loading packages into an L9. "
good,"At the point of writing this review, I have been employed with UPS as a Revenue Recovery Auditor for roughly 3 years. This job was the first one I ever had, so this is from the view of someone who otherwise has no other job experience."
good,"A typical day at UPS can be described as intense and stressful, because everything that we do is based on completing the daily operations in the amount time allotted for that day which is based on the amount of outgoing volume that we receive for the day."
good,"Work is hard and often chaotic and stressful."
good,"it was steady work, I enjoyed staying busy and didnt mind the job at all just being laid off i could not make ends meet working 6 months a year"
good,I have nothing but good things to say about UPS the company taught me a lot about myself and showed me different things that I didn't know before.
good,UPS is a great place to work but getting to the part where one a sustainable is a bit taxing because the establishment is unionized. They do not promote because you are the best but because you have been there the longest and it is your turn.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for with great benefits.  The job environment is a very tough, competitive atmosphere that is very demanding for perfection from all their employees."
good,Not a bad place to be.  Management could do a little more to train new hires.  Provide good compensation as far as hourly pay and benefits for part-time and full-time employees.
good,"A very progressive company that seems to be looking into the future."
good,Delivered goods to people or companies. Ensured address on package matches up to delivery address.Monitored traffic conditions to avoid delays; read and interpreted maps and GPS directions.
good,"I think that UPS was a good place to work.  There were a lot of challanges, but it made the work more educational that helped in other situatuons that I came upon."
good,"ups is a good job with good benefits and pay , ive learned a lot of things but most importantly ive learned how to operate a forklift , the hardest thing is how far i live away from the job location my co workers are friendly"
good,"As a warehouse associate an usual day-duty consist of login into the system and verifying the daily orders, then working with a team to ensure the order made its deadline while following all procedures and rules established by the company. Been a HEALTHCARE facility we had to be very careful in every step of the way."
good,"A cet époque, seulement temps partiel"
good,"I enjoyed my 6 month stay UPS. It's fast paced, which makes the day go by quickly and you can catch a little workout too. I would have stayed longer, but my mother's cancer progressed and she needed extra help at home. However, in my short time at UPS I learned to work quickly and efficiently. All workers and Supervisors are friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the heavy flow of packages during the holiday season (Christmas especially) and trying to build a neat wall while your Supervisors shove more and more packages at your halfway built wall. Most enjoyable part is the feeling of working at UPS is getting through the day and knowing that you helped someone get something they needed."
good,"Fun, up-beat place to work, management team great."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits when and a good union. The hours are more part time which is a plus since it is a warehouse that is not temperature controlled. You can go full time once you have been with the company for a while and you would either go into management or become a company driver."
good,A decent place to work provided you have no aversion to a fast pace and hard work. The excellent benefits including help with college expenses make it worthwhile especially for younger individuals looking to start a career or go back to school.
good,"Almost every employee starts as a loader or unloader. Summers are extremely hot and winter very cold! You need to be strong willed to stick it out. Through hard work and dedication, you can become a part-time operations supervisor. Lack of incentive for all part-time employees, union or not. Expectations can be very high and if you can't handle the intensity, don't bother showing up. Great benefits, great incentive for college, great workout."
good,UPS is a great company and provides many opportunities to be promoted to become truck drivers with the correct qualifications that are required for the job. good benefits.
good,"we typically get 17-21 hours weekly "
good,"I have gain experience in how to be a leader, how to multitask, and how to deal things under pressure. Its a face pace and heavy duty job."
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,"Good place but they have been known to outsource whole departments at the drop of a hat. Certain management can really be a help to you but others don't care unless you give them what they want vs. what is good for the customer or individual. Still, a lot of departments to move into, provided they aren't going to outsource you in a few months/years."
good,"Working non stop, coworkers are good to work with. Most Supervisors are just trying to get you off the clock to benefit themselves."
good,"This is a good job for students because they offer tuition reimbursement and they offer a flexible, part-time schedule"
good,"Love talking to people making them feel good and find items looking for! Stocking merchandise,Retail,and getting customers to apply for credit cards.I really got to learn a lot about myself such as I thrive under pressure and I have excellent organizational skills."
good,"Working for UPS was a very great company to work for I learned a lot at the company dealing with different clients, the computer skills was great."
good,"Planned and reviewed daily plans for safety, service and production with managers and division managers. Daily results were reviewed at the end of day with all managers. I supervised 8 part time supervisors and 28 union employees daily. The position I held improved my leadership skills and organizational skills. The management team worked on a ongoing basis on keeping every work group safe and productive. Working with a team environment helped with all daily plans and service. The hardest part of the job was the time spent away from home and family. At the end od day I felt great to achieve all goals of safety, service and production."
good,"My typical night starts at 11 at night, on the inbound ballmat with aircrafts coming in, and the tug dispatchers bringing in containers in on a train of dollies to the inbound."
good,It is a noisy and busy environment. The management team is helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the amount of volume we deal with. The most enjoyable part is the challenge of  loading all of the boxes.
good,"The hardest job you will ever start at the bottom. "" Guaranteed"" If you don't have a good work ethic don't work here you will bring down the rest of us."
good,"I had a great career going the FedEx Freight, with time and moving up the ladder. My work life balance was more of work 70- 30 percentage. My home life suffered, with my success at work. You have to delegate and train your supervisors, in order for you to succeed."
good,Good place to work for someone who is still in school or college.  Not a good career choice unless high income is not needed or franchise is personally owned by you.
good,Ups is not a fit for everyone. Has its pros and cons. You need to be really strong and during peak season you may work 12 hour shifts.
good,"Package handler stacking boxes in trailers. Networking is everything. Good management throughout my time there. Excellent bunch of co~workers. Nothing hard about the job. Meeting a good group of people, which made our night go by fast."
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunately they don´t always have forklift work for me. Company pays on time, they give a good Perdim, plus they pay travel too."
good,"Holidays were the heaviest. During the week it would get busy and we weren't dismissed at the time we were suppose to but it all paid off at the end of the week. This job is pretty heavy, of course, due to their shipments from small to large packages, but through out any usual day in that spot, we all kept it professional as well as funny to get through the long day."
good,"The people are great and the management staff is very open and fair."
good,My normal work day would be interacting with customers and co-workers to complete any task given in a timely manner and do it so it makes everyone look good as a company.
good,"awesome benefit package and a steady work environment."
good,Fast-paced and professional work environment. Room for growth and career advancement. Love the small business setting with few employees.
good,I like the job but hours only varied from 3 to 4 hours a night and it was causing conflict with my class work. I would recommend the early shift if you are a student
good,"UPS-- as aforementioned-- is a productive and fun workplace. "
good,hard work from beginning to end. not for everyone. The management team is always swapping supervisors and managers to trying out new strategies.
good,"Opened and closed, worked ten hour days. Set up USPS mailboxes for customers, sorted mail and packages. Pack items being sent out appropriately, using measurements and taking items in to consideration. Provide estimates on shipping, explaining the options available. Print/order projects for walk-ins as well as return customers. Notary."
good,Continuous forklift use and occasional manual lifting. Regular exposure to hazardous materials experience. Casual Management.
good,"At UPS it's a physical job, you constantly on your feet moving and lifting boxes ranging from 2 lbs- over a 100 lbs."
good,"The day starts out with unloading from trucks,"
good,"Review safety tip/staffing/ and operational plans for the evening with all work groups.  I learned to have a proper barrier when it comes to supervisor/employee relationships. I learned that it is very important to keep my employees accountable.  Management cared about their employees and their supervisors.  They made safety an important value for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside. I worked at the King County Boeing Field Int'l in Seattle. Watching the plane, that you just worked on take off, was an indescribable feeling."
good,"As a driver helper, I assisted in the Christmas rush with UPS. The atmosphere was pleasant for the amount of work and every day was unique. I learned a lot about UPS' basic delivery process. I learned that this is a good opportunity for those seeking to become drivers but see themselves out of consideration."
good,"For Part Time:"
good,Ups is a good place to work if you are a student or currently looking for a second job.  The hours are convenient to where it does not take up your whole day.  After a year employees can enroll for health benefits.  Hard work is highly encouraged here.
good,"work part time with full benefits. physical labor job that pays well, and gives you plenty of time to attend and help pay for school while working."
good,A very good work environment to work in UPS. Handling team in absence of Team leaders.Multitasking of work on different processes. Priority of work.
good,"A typical day starts at 4 am loading and unloading trucks.  Once all of the work is done, that is the end of the day.  The people are all around good to work with and the pay is decent."
good,A typical day at UPS working the pre-load shift involved getting to work by 4:30am. From there on I would work with the pre-loaders to ensure that they were putting the right packages on the correct truck. From time to time I was scan the trucks to see if anyone was missing a load and positioning packing in the wrong vehicle.
good,"I got to meet and interact with different people from surrounding neighborhood and come to see that normally people are cordial."
good,"Loved being a part of the union, knowing that we wouldn't get mistreated was one less thing to worry about.  Pay was awesome and the work was difficult, but it was only five hour shifts and we all got along."
good,"A typical day at work consists of routing bills, answering phone calls, scheduling pick-ups and deliveries, helping with customer pick-ups and billing. I have learned that the shipping industry is always changing. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer thanks me for helping them, or when a driver tells me I am doing a great job."
good,I love this job.  because with all work in team atmosphere.  Always extremenly busy.  An management was great.  Also I took care af all of the paper work.
good,"The company is Unionized, and only hires part time. Once you are employed you can bid for full time positions, however they rarely open up. My position is an inside warehouse package handler. The work although very repetitive is never the same from one day to the next. It is a very fast paced work environment, and you do what has to be done to get the goal accomplished. The employees are great, and they keep the job fun."
good,A typical day at ups is hot and hard and you working with some who make more then you and that do lass work then you. but it can be very easy to move up there.
good,"Position interesting because required many skills to fulfill...the physical nature administrative, and communication...having in similar position it is why adapted very quickly...appreciate the time the drivers took to answer my questions and when saw I demonstrated strong initiative to work they provided good co-worker support what I did wrong they let me know and I worked on it to correct it...being an individual not big on constant routine, meeting in a different location every day or week was fulfilling for me...it is also a job of an even combination of guided and unguided intervention...If opportunity arises will do again"
good,Professional environment and fast paced management were helpful only sometimes.Needs to be more attentive to their workers and care about their well beings and health.
good,"United Parcel Services(UPS) is the largest parcel delivering company in the world.Based all over the world and in most big towns,Stockholm Sweden has two big centres.Working in the Jarfalla branch is much fun as u come across interesting colleagues with different characters.In UPS i learned how to braced different cultures as we had people from different countries with different cultures and beliefs.The management is of high quality as they always ensure everything is rightly done and in time.its very encouraging to work there as the enviroment is condusive and work friendly."
good,My time with the UPS store was good. I made some great friends and it was a great atmosphere for people who want to work with their social skills. It is very busy at Christmas time but a rather easy job the rest of the year.
good,"Full busy days, appreciative employees, great management. Very team oriented and learned very much considering it was a seasonal job. Would go back for seasonal or full time if the opportunity is there."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits. Terrible hours, working conditions, and standards for the job. Overall, expect stagnant growth within the company."
good,"At UPS, I was a return clerk. When a package cant be delivered, it returns to the building. My job was to recirculate the package back into the system. I would reprocess the package, give it a new date, and reship the package to the customers."
good,"UPS is a great place to work. Good work ethics amongst employees,  fast paced environment, you work one on one with a driver, you leave happy all together."
good,The work at ups is fair. The fact that it is part time is the flaw. The managers treat you fairly and the benefits are a plus.
good,The UPS store was a fun place to work for. The owner is a good rounded man. Clean and neat work place. Provide uniforms. You will be given the chance to run the store without supervision.
good,"Normal day is unloading trailers followed by fixing damaged packages and correcting addresses on packages.  Aside from some shipping standards and a basic understanding of MSDS, there is not much that you learn from this job.  Management at the facility in Grand Rapids is decent, and there are many great people to work with.  Job does get very repetitious over time and due to union, advancement is based on seniority only.  This translates to many workers not working very hard."
good,"I enjoyed working at The UPS Store! I would open the store and interact with customers all day! I was able to build relationships with many of them because of the mail boxes they had as well as frequently needed the services that the store offered. Working with the customer was the most enjoyable part for me, I enjoy being around people, and being able to help in any way that I can!"
good,"Tuseday is the longest day for the business"
good,The hours might seem daunting at first but once you adjust your schedule you will be very satisfied and feel that you have earned every bit of your paycheck.
good,"If you enjoy working on your own with minimal supervision, this is the job for you. It is a quiet environment that allows for a balance between home and work."
good,"This is a company that requires physically fit individuals to complete that task of moving our worlds inventory from point a to point z. I loved it, saved me money because I rarely had to visit the gym, and they offered education financial assistance."
good,"A Typical day at work was pretty awesome, My driver was a very cool and down to earth person. Over all it was a wonderful experience."
good,"Deliver parcels, interact with customers, clarify company and customer participation, encourage new digital methods of company functions and customer benefits. Great staff. Cooperation of employees leads to better work days both with communication and task management. Physically demanding. Character of Operations made the job much more enjoyable."
good,"on any given day the volume of packages and where you would be delivering those packages would change. when delivering many different challenges would arise, weather, traffic not being able to find a location or a package and unscheduled pick ups or mechanical failure. the management and the other drivers where very helpful and great to work with."
good,I had to work in the warehouse and load boxes off the conveyor belt into the back of trailers. Not to bad only part time though.
good,"Days start off relatively early, around 7:00. Once you get there you start by going through a safety meeting and reviewing some pretty obvious safety tips. Then you would be reciving your DIAD and getting in your truck. If youre late, you will probably upset some of the drivers that are next to you since they cant get out of the building untill you do, meaning there day is gonna be longer. Once your in your truck you gotta start planning out your day (what route you wanna take first). You also are going to want to start organizing the back of your truck so you can find your packages easier. If you dont, youre going to fall way behind and get very stressed out. You are also going to have to keep going in the back of your truck to pick up all the packages that have dropped to the floor and put them in the right order again on the shelves. That happens all of the time. Other than that its simply driving from street to street and scanning and dropping packages off in a spot where they wont get dammaged. You are always going to be by your self, unless its around christmass time. Thats when things get insanely crazy, however they will probably hook you up with a package helper, who would run the packages off while you sort in the back. I love the job at peak when someones with me, otherwise you can get kind of lonely and stressed; being that there is no radio in your truck. The management there can be quite harsh on you as well. They will call you in the middle of your route to check up on you and see how many stops youve done. If you havnt done the amount of stops THEY would like"
good,Worked everyday and delivered packages to customers doorsteps. overall was a good job there is a lot of walking but the pay is very well.
good,ups is a good place to work at if your in school or just need a part time job for a little extra cash or benefits this job will keep you in shape or whip you right into shape i love it if your and active person you'll love it to
good,Working at UPS was a nice experience. People are nice and helpful. It is physically taxing so be prepared to handle the worst of it. You should have utter low expectation when applying and coming to work. If you can continuously lift packages and do not mind the weather condition then I would recommend working here.
good,"Hard work and focus of the employees, i learned that its a lot of physical labor goes into the delievery of mail."
good,A typical day is spent reacting to yesterdays results.  Most employees are enjoyable to work with.  Others require strategic handling to get the desired results
good,"I have enjoy to be surrounded of very nice people."
good,"Strong company, very fast paced work environment. I enjoyed my time with UPS. It is very difficult to get to full time driver position."
good,"Good job, fast pace, lots of workers, must be on time everyday, people were easy to get along with. Must be able to make quick and accurate choices."
good,"Accueil téléphonique et relance client."
good,"It is highly important to be on time working through UPS because packages must be sent to the customer at certain time period. UPS is fast pace work though it is important to know surroundings and aware of your safety. Overall, you get a great workout and full benefits."
good,Early hours with large volume of packages come down the line quickly.
good,"UPS was a very good experience for me. unfortunately it was only seasonal, but the work was easy to pick up and the staff was extremely friendly."
good,Very fast paced fun working environment with much to learn and great benefits.
good,Working for UPS is perfect for college students looking for part time work. They pay more than minimum wage and offer benefits for part time workers. They're very understanding about your school schedule. Co-workers are very casual and really make an enjoyable environment. The main con is that its a very physically strenuous job. You have to be very conscious at all times to avoid injuring yourself.
good,"I am a brokerage office supervisor at United Parcel Service which means I oversee an office of 11 employees. An average day sees me trouble shooting various issues (customer queries, logistic concerns, etc).  In my 8 years working at UPS I have learned a lot about getting a job done in a timely manner because at UPS the only thing we can provide our customers is the service they expect each time they ship a package. It is very gratifying when I can phone a customer and let them know their package or packages will be delivered on time.  I have worked with some great people through the years. The majority of my employees have been with UPS since they opened up shop in Winnipeg back in 1988 and they have been all too quick to pass their knowledge and experiences on to me. A supervisor is only as good as his or her employees and I have been blessed with professional and hard working employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can talk with my employees on a personal level and just have a nice conversation."
good,"I absolutely loved working as a driver helper"
good,"My typical work day consist of morning meetings, and then straight to work. No time to get behind or it makes it harder for you. Management is not that great because of no communication with our supervisor. She feels the need not to tell us about volume for the day or how many can or feeders need to be out at a certain time. My coworkers are great people and have built great relationships with them. The hardest part of my job is at the end of the day when its crunch time because my supervisor is in a hurry. The best part of my job are the new people I have got to know."
good,Only worked here shortly for the seasonal time. Yet it was an easy fast pace job. It does definitely take a toll in your body constantly delivering packages.
good,We usually do our job with lots of teamwork or all alone depending on the area. Hardest part of the job is staying hydrated.
good,"It is too hard to reach any one, since often times the call you from the general number that wont work if you call back. Then in order to get the extension number you either just need to know it or know their name and call the 800 number. However even having that information wont always get you connected since the people on the 800 will some times say that that can't help you with that, they don't know it either, or that that number was only for tracking packages and such."
good,"UPS does not train you for driver helper. Not one bit. the only thing that they care about is not having you injured. However, the job pays and is a door that can help you go far for UPS. If you get a responsible and Patient driver it is a pretty great job."
good,"Its pretty straight forward work, send packages to the proper slot that they belong"
good,Great overall work environment in which you are not micromanaged and trusted to get your work done.
good,"I load boxes for the entire time that I'm there. I'm constantly moving. Its a fast paced environment. I receive a 10 minute break for the four hours I do work. I learned how to work as a team, and get things done quickly but correctly when they are to be done. Management is constantly walking around the building, and they are involved with everyone. They know everyone's names. My co-workers are other college students that go to school with me, or other close schools. Hardest part of the job is whenever you are rushed by others to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that I get along with."
good,The hardest part of the job is lifting hardware. The management team is very helpful. My coworker are fun to work with.

good,"A day loading in UPS could be a rough time for someone who is lazy and not used to hard labor, but once you get the hang of it and keep going it starts to come natural and more easier the more and more you do it. The co-workers are great, talking to them could make your whole day go by smoother,thats the best part of the job. The shift managers were even cooler, especially if everyones doing their job.The hardest part of the job to me was just making it there, and once i did that i enjoyed my shift."
good,"no quisiera opinar de esta empresa, no me gustaron algunas cosas."
good,It was an ok environment I guess. I wasn't there long enough to form a real opinion about it.
good,This is a physically demanding job if you are not hired as a supervisor. The benefits are excellent and pay was great for a weekly check. The manual labor on the body was demanding for a female.

good,"UPS was my first job in my time working i've been exposed to alot of different things. The average day at work was busy and I always remained active. During a typical day you start out toggling into scanner and then the truck that your loading in and you read the shipping labels, after verifying that the labels match the truck destination you load it, and continue the process until the truck/feeder is full. Picking off at the top of the belts you have to work with the conveyor belt distribute the packages into the proper shoots to the loaders of the trucks. Also for I was responsible for loading hazmats and taking the labels and placing them in the hazmat pouch in the rear of the truck. The hardest part of the shift was the end wrapping up and putting the irregular sized packages in, we usually put those in last and they were a hassle because the average one weighed about 70 pounds or higher."
good,"Considero que el equipo de trabajo tanto gerencial como obrero es totalmente eficaz, en mi caso en el departamento en que laboro cuento con un jefe con el que mantengo muy buena  comunicacion y del que he aprendido mucho, ya que comparte todo su conocimiento explicando cualquier duda. Sin embargo la empresa no cuenta con una estabilidad segura para quienes alli laboramos ya que no cuenta con mayores ganancias perjudicando asi contar con  beneficios necesarios para el trabajador. asi mismo cuento con un poco de dificultad para manejar el horario de trabajo con mis estudios ya que la empresa queda lejos de la Universidad  y se me es complejo llegar a tiempo."

good,Fast paced enviroment with focus on results and where client is a vital element of the day to day life of any UPS'ers.
good,"UPS is a great brand with fair pay and good management. However, the large size of the company and the countless departments often make it difficult to communicate across divisions. There is a large disconnect between corporate employees and those in the distribution centers/drivers."
good,"Working at UPS was interesting, exciting, fast-pace, but essential to me and every business that relies on their well-known, outstanding  services. I learned a lot about leadership here. I started off a unloader and just months later I was promoted to a supervisor position leading my own crew. I took pleasure in training/ coaching employees how to sort packages safely and effectively. Also, I create a team working environment and I met my goals regularly."
good,"Daily running of 9 man crew to pick up and deliver cans filled with packages throughout airport property."
good,"Worked outdoors delivering packages to friendly customers. Learned about the courier business. Delt with all types of managers and supervisors, some good and some not so good. I worked well with most of my co-workers. Hardest part of job was the peak season, October thru January. That's the busiest time of the year. Most enjoyable part of job was working outdoors and meeting people."
good,"UPS is a good place to work when starting out. It can get overwhelming sometimes with the workflow, but it's something that you can adapt to. Great Benefits, tuition assistance available for the employees and opportunities for advancement into higher positions."

good,"I enjoy the hours I work, the benefits allowed to part time employees, and the environment within the company itself"
good,"Typical day at work is very hard physically for the labor intensive procedures during loading/unloading/sorting packages. One can develop themselves by experiencing a time sensitive and detail oriented work environment. Management is very demanding but always there helping. Co-workers can be difficult but if you put in your share of hard work the others will be just as motivated to do so as well. Hardest part of the job is maintaining focus and determination to do the job day in, and day out without errors (misleads, missorts, damages). The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships one builds with co-workers in addition to the advancement opportunities available."
good,don't do it its really a part time job..i learned to work better

good,"- Inputing data into company programs and record precise document for custom."
good,"Managed given territory that shipped 10,000 to 50,000 annually. Some employees worked the system and took extended leaves for medical issues, while other had a great work ethic.

good,Working at UPS taught me a lot about logistics and management. I trained new employees. I enjoyed the flexible hours as well. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to communicate with new people everyday. I also was able to build new relationships with the employees and customers. It was a great job.
good,Great company good benefits only con is that is a part time. I have learned how to be more of a team player and how to take constructive criticism and apply it to my job
good,Helping the driver deliver packages during the holiday season was good.
good,"I would take the packages out of the bins to be put into a larger bag, once filled I would throw it on the conveyor belt. I didn't really learned much it was a warehouse environment. I loved my coworkers but mostly man oriented. The hardest part of the job was the weather. Whatever it was outside was what condition you had to work in. The most enjoyable part was getting a workout while working."
good,A typical UPS shift includes moving packages quickly throughout the building to get them to their proper destination on time. I've learned to manage my time effectively due to the tightly scheduled trailer routes. The hardest part of the job is communication with other employees. Thankful for the union and management keeping things in order. It is satisfying knowing that my small contribution in the postal service goes a long way.
good,"Great co-workers and management, fun working environment"
good,the duty of my co workers and i was to get to work on time to deliver the packages as early as possible.the co workers was very helpful of informing me the best ways of doing the job.the most enjoyable part of the job was that i get to work long hours.the hardest part of the job was delivering in various weather conditions.at my time on the job i've learned how to operate the scanning devices and to finish my work on a timely manner
good,"UPS is all about numbers, speed and efficiency.  For some, it's too fast and too stressful.  You will be saying the same thing over and over but you must treat each customer like you've never heard their perceived problem.  Customer satisfaction is the goal, but you must maintain your numbers to keep your job.  Advancement is not easy.  Compensation is fair since you're raise is based on your performance and not some set number.  The hardest part is taking the verbal abuse from the customers.  Business owners are stressed about their money and they tend to forget business manners a lot.  The web based customers are in a rush to get things done so they tend to be even more abusive because they can.  Since I'm technically inclined, the fun part was fixing issues over the phone especially with customers networks.  I learned a lot in my three years and thank management for the opportunity to grow and shine when I did."
good,A typical work day i would get to the office by8 am and get on the road by 9am management and co-workers was ver friendly and caring. We had long days and whatever driver i helped was very nice

good,UPS is a great company to work for. The environment is extremely fast-paced and is not for anyone used to being pampered in the work place
good,"Call center atmosphere with many hour choices. Shifts up to midnight. Many chances for over time, and decent starting pay. You typically answer 100+ calls a day, and your time on the phone with each customer is typically short, but not every call is going to be a happy customer. You do deal with a lot of unhappy customers, and the job is mentally and emotionally demanding more than anything."
good,"Organizing routes for local drivers to deliver on that particular day. Preparing shipping labels for out -going and in coming packages for customers to have loaded daily, once product shipped prepare for billing, manager for 50 warehouse associates, monitoring timesheets and authorizing when needed overtime and vacation time off. Generated daily and weekly reports for my superiors review. Monitoring trucks incoming and outgoing to manage a daily schedule for shipments, dispatching included."
good,Really fun environment to work in and also getting to know people everyday and helping them is such a great accomplishment to me. And also been a team player helps with productivity at work. The most enjoyable part is getting to know customers on a regular basis
good,I learned how to scan packages and delivered them to customers and getting a signature. Enjoyed lunches at different restaurants with great individuals. Always got compliments
good,"Working with and training people, often teenagers right out of high school is challenging.  Working in a warehouse without temperature control and moving packages as quickly as possible is also dirty work.  However, though my days were busy with training and managing union employees, I often left feeling very good about the work I accomplished each shift.  "
good,"I'd a rough start but in a matter of few days, coworkers at the facility were helpful."
good,"A typical day on the job is usually an early start and a late finish. Customer service is held to very high standards. A lot of the time a very friendly report is developed between the customer and the UPS driver. Management seem to do a pretty decent job of managing all other co-workers. They try to keep the work environment clean and fair. All of the co-workers seem to be nice and friendly people. Everyone works hard and are always willing to assist one another is completing their assigned duties. There isn't much about the job that is difficult.To me the hardest part of the job is waking up early and constantly making stops and getting on and off the truck to make delivers but you will quickly get use to that. The most enjoyable parts of the job is the interaction with co-workers and the customer, the travel and of course the pay rate."
good,I enjoyed working with this company & loved the benefits. It was a very laid back work place.
good,This was a fun place to very fast paced job and the climate control is different.
good,"An excellent place to work with games, music, free food, & recreation at least once a quarter.  Teams were given time for training  & education.  Too bad UPS had to close the site.  A lot of excellent management team & staff."
good,"A well oiled machine when it comes to logistics, UPS is a company that can provide a career or part time permanent employment."
good,"The job is very high speed paced, the management is very accessible. My co-workers are very enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of my job is standing on cement. The most enjoyable part of the day is working in such a productive environment."
good,good job flexible hours with great pay. alot of growth at this company
good,"-I have learned the basics of being a manager"
good,"constantemente revisàbamos inventarios para la toma de decisiones "
good,"Hard and physical work, but a great job for a great company. Flexible schedules. Advancement based on seniority but also opportunities to go into Management."
good,"A typical day would be me doing my daily data entry into system while checking for correction with little to not supervisor on a deadline."
good,I've learned that working with UPS its a good and great opportunity. Hardest part of that job was adapting to the speed and the times things had to be done. By doing that i caught on in a week and began doing my job at my best.
good,"Set up our stations, then the mail would be brought to us. We all were given a certain customer. Scan the customer envelope, scan and weigh the package, enter all the information on the package into the computer, print out the label and put it on the package and put the package where it belongs. Management was good. Always was able to get a hold of them when I needed to. Answered all my questions and concerns; co-workers were great as well. We all worked together as a team. I learned how to work at a face pace with a dead line. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers, we all got along and communicated well. When things needed to be done right away we all worked as a team to get it done."
good,"""All Business"" Managers and decent coworkers, good equipment, recieved very little attitude from anyone at UPS, it would be hard to do better. Everything good comes to the more senior employee here, but that is the case anywhere, right? Overall I was totally satisfied working here as a driver."
good,"Good company overtime, money wise, some upper management our not trustworthy. Most employees are great people to work with. Also, not a easy job hard labor"
good,A typical day at work usually consisted of meeting driver and getting deliveries organized after frequent stops. I learned that a driver should always use saftey first as well as the helper. The driver would hand me the correct box and i would safely move at a quick pace to drop off delivery at the door. During the 2013 holidays UPS recieved overloads which caused me to improvise and enabled me to work at a high performance. The management would recieve a grade of a B because of lack of organization and to lenient. The majority of the coworkers were very helpful and knowledgeable of how this organization worked
good,Had to load 4 trucks with packages to be delivered on time. This job was exhausting
good,"it was an ok job, but its a On call job only...Didn't know what hours you will be working"
good,"Not the typical UPS job but worth the time if you need some work. Hours were irregular but pretty available as far as part time work goes. It was nice to get weekly paychecks, the drivers were great to work with."
good,"UPS is not a bad place to work.  The pay is not great, but the benefits make up for it.  They also provide great tuition reimbursement."
good,"Great company to work for with fantastic benefits.  Work volume is inconsistent, however."
good,This job opened my eyes to the logistics environment.  Had great colleagues and supervisors.  Favorite part time job.
good,The work experiance was more difficult then i thought. The driver that i was with was really fun and nice and we got the job done before most of the other drivers even got their trucks half way emptied. The hardest part of the job was carrying packages that weighed 100+ Lbs.
good,"Outdoors at the airport, good management, fun at work, learning how to operate all different kinds of machinery"
good,"I would meet the driver and ride along at about 10 am or 12 noon. We would work till about 7 or 8pm. It was not stressful, but very demanding of working fast. The time flew fairly fast, which was great. We ran packages buisnesses in bulk and a lot of single packages to houses. It was fairly simple work. I enjoyed being in the truck and organizing the boxes the most. I enjoy organizing a lot. I would work there next Christmas."
good,"handling packages organization  skills   good working place"
good,Lo que mas me gusto de este trabajo era la relación con mis compañeros y la libertad en poder desarrollar mi trabajo.
good,A typical day's work consisted of loading packages into parcel trucks for daily deliveries. My managers and fellow colleagues were very easy going people.
good,"On a daily basis i manage a team from 8 to 13 employees that load the out bound trailers. It is my responsibility to ensure this is done a safe, service oriented and productive manor. My responsibility is also to ensure that each feeder has the correct paperwork making it legal to roll down the road. The hardest part of the job is ensuring the service of each individual package. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my employees. I've learned a number of things from the united parcel service but the thing that sticks out the most is how to operate efficiently."
good,Employed at UPS since February 24th 1986. It`s a very demanding job that requires long hours and tight time commitments. But it has been a steady well paying job for almost 27 years. I actually enjoy my job but it`s time to move on.
good,"learning how to swim, also how to help a person in distress while swimming"
good,"A very non-descript trailer unloading job. Management lacked communication between workers and themselves. Daily, weekly and yearly goals were never clear, or changed between managers. Co-workers were an interesting bunch and added excitement to the job"
good,"A typical day at UPS consists of waking up around 3 a.m. to make it to work. Recieve the information for the day and the safety tip of the day and recieve our assignments of the day. Personally, I'm an unloader of freight trucks so that they may be scanned and loaded into delivery trucks. I've learned to listen more and pace myself for more efficient production. Management wasn't the greatest, there were only a select few that supervisors that were willing to compromise with you due to body wear and tear, to at least give you somewhat of a rest. But the hardest part of the building was trying to stay healthy because of the health risk conditions, whereas the most enjoyable part was unloading because you were bothered unless the belts were turned off. You were able to listen to your music as you find your pace to be most productive."
good,lots of opportunity within the company but based on seniority.
good,"Fun place to work , customer driven learned how to load,unload trucks ,sort packages  , drove Irreg tugs"
good,You work form the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. They are always looking to promote. The people you meet their are very work oriented and want to get the job done.
good,"delivering boxes to big businesses, houses and other places on foot and also in the truck for half the time, lots of lifting and is really casual"
good,"It is a desk job"

good,Prepare for entire Inbound operations (Aircraft and Trailer) Loads by Pre-planning dispatch movements to UPS and vendor facilities throughout the Greater Los Angeles Area. Supervise load and offload of UPS Aircraft operations at LAX Gateway. Coordinate trailer operations to ensure volume is processed correctly. Weight and Balance Certified procedures are used for upload of UPS Aircraft to ensure the safety of flight. Collaborate with my co-workers during the operations to correct information and assignments are followed by work staff of 50+employees. The hardest part of the day is knowing the operation will have to eventually end. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing how great the work environment is that I have the privilege to be a part of.
good,I have enjoyed working for UPS as I have gained a vast amount of knowledge and experience in an administration/operations sector which will help me in future endeavors.
good,Normal day would be going in and unloading boxes from trucks for 4-5 hours. I learned about teamwork and keeping deadlines. The supervisors were friendly but demanding due to the deadlines. The hardest part of the job was the physical demand. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time.
good,"It's always a new experience here at the UPS Store. Working here as a print designer is very interesting. It has served me a great deal being able to gain experience in the programs I use as a designer and understanding the print side of design better as well. "
good,"Supervised Security and damage reduction claims operations in Hub facility. Tasks included supervising security staff and guard services, maintaining security of Hub facility, staff, and parcel. Assist and coordinate Hub operations management with claims reduction awareness and techniques. Conduct investigations of security and claim related incidents when appropriate."
good,ups was demanding but rewarding. employees were always treated with respect and is a very organized work environment
good,ups is fun but this particular job they would call you every day wanting you to work. you never knew ahead of time
good,"Great atmosphere, Great management and staff. Superb location."
good,"Really a good job, good benefits, but takes a really long time to go full time. I've been there almost 11 years and am still part-time. It's a union job so everything goes by seniority, not by how good of a worker you are."
good,"Handling the packages wave betwwen the trucks and the small packages cars."
good,"Organizing and processing customer orders on nigh shift making sure that truck departure timelines are met. "
good,"I had good times with my co-workers and supervisors the work place was quick and fast, physical and hands on work"
good,"Fue mi primera experiencia de logística en oficina, gestionando las salidas urgentes de los clientes."
good,"UPS is a great place to work.  UPS is fast paced and typically keeps me busy throughout the night, which I enjoy.  Things are always changing.  I've learned how to multitask and how to manage my time effectively.  Overall I like my job because I like to keep busy."
good,Very good place to work the employees and supervisors are friendly. Its not hard about the job but you must keep a fast pace when it comes to loading packages. But really enjoy unloading trucks because I get to move at a fast pace and I get a very good workout.
good,ups is a worldwide business and the thanks you get from the customers is very unforgettable.
good,"Typical day at work is very consistant pace"
good,great company with great benefits. wish the job advancement was a little better. Ive been waiting to go full time for over 9 years
good,"Takes too long to progress into management. Otherwise, it is a great company."
good,UPS is a good company to work for but the room for advancement is extremely low.
good,"If you work night shift they pay for college which is phenomenal. The bad part is you only get 4 hours a night if that sometimes. The work is hard physical labor which is both good and bad it helps keep you in shape, but it also wears on your body after a while. UPS warehouse workers are union which is good because of the job security and such, but in a way it almost makes it harder to advance."
good,I've learned a lot in management on the importance of running a business
good,Great company to work for would love to return. Finding difficult (if not impossible to apply online for said position)
good,"Work as a Package Handler is simple. You are assigned specific package cars to load. The boxes come down on a conveyor belt and you grab your trucks packages. The boxes have labels that determine the truck and placement of each individual package. There are a lot of boxes and you can only load them so fast. The management at my location is not the best but not the worst. The supervisors for a lack of better words are like slave drivers. Some days you wonder if they are on your side or out to get you. Now the co-workers are pretty enjoyable and pretty helpful. The guys who have been there usually will help you out with good advice and help you in many situations. The only really hard part is the physical demands. I have to load five trucks all with a one-foot step up. Boxes are usually lighter weight but depending on the truck you could have a bulk stop with Home Depot stuff and all they get is boxes of bolts or whatever. The twilight shift can be a bear to get use to. When not peak work is 4:30am-8:30am depending on when you finish. During peak,like closer to December, shift starts at 1:30am till you finish.All in all good place for hard workers who DON'T mind sweating."
good,"Staff and managers were very nice with many opportunities to advance, only difficult part of the job was handling packages over the weight specified for the trailers."
good,"Typical day at UPS is to gather packages from airplane and take them to their destination. Or just the opposite of that. What I have learned during my time there is that with customers you have to give what they ask of you which would be on time. Which of that falls in with the management because if we don't provide the customers packages on time, the management takes a loss and disciplinary actions have to take place. I get along with my co-workers very well. We work very efficiently together. There really isn't a hard part about my job which is rare i think for other jobs or what people might say. The most enjoyable part of the job is arriving to work on time ready and eager to work."
good,"A good company, I would recommend it. Can be a fast-paced physical job."
good,"Typical day for the full-time overnight worker includes leaving your family as they are ending the day and going to a building where you get used and abused for eight hours. Depending on your location, managers and supervisors have varying degrees of people skills. Some see you as highly replaceable, while others see you as a valuable team member. The pay and benefits are amazing, which makes up for the hard job."
good,"At UPS, I learned how to work in an warehouse. Look up information to find the customers merchandise. I also learned how to pack and receive items by codes."
good,"Fast work pace environment, High stress with little down time. Multitasking, with a smile. Minimal training, high expectations,  manage by exception."
good,loading boxes on a plane in all weather. enjoy the people around you.
good,UPS is a fast paced environment.You are constantly moving from the start to the end of your shift. You can get a good workout there from all the moving and lifting of packages.
good,"Es fácil asimilar las funciones, sean del puesto que sean, ya que el grupo es muy compacto y todos colaboran con las tareas de todos, está muy centralizado, y hacen que haya mejor conocimiento de los problemas y sus soluciones. "
good,"I do enjoy my job and there is job security here."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my role within UPS, there is good scope for progression within the company and a large variety of roles."
good,"UPS is a very complex company to work for, its like any other company , all what you make it ,ups downs highs and lows .As long as you remain positive , attitude ,mind , body and soul , you can advance just position yourself  with the positive co- workers that you may find on your work site ,do your best  and some will recogize you and your teams effort, things learned .....tons..Good luck to All  !!!"
good,"Good pay for the hours. Very fast-paced, lots of lifting and moving."
good,Tons of autonomy.  Great future if you want to top out at 60k.  Old folks won't hang it up so you can advance.
good,"Fast pace, good co-workers. Early morning hours are the hardest part of the job. I enjoy working there."
good,working for the world's largest logistics and transportation company is challenging  and ever evolving
good,"I feel that the United Parcel Service is a great place to work, accept it has its ups and downs. It is very hard to get promoted and advancement takes years and is very difficult. It is military style atmosphere with many different kinds of people working in the same place. Take it with a grain of salt and just work while at work and leave work at work. Don't put to much thought into it. I'm jus being honest basing my six years of being there. The work is fairly easy and you need to be in pretty good physical shape in order to make it there.  "
good,"I work with some very talented and capable people that make my work day fun and productive. We have challenging times and through teamwork, we overcome even the greatest obstacles. "
good,"UPS is a great and fun place to work. There is many obstacles to overcome such as working third shift and dealing with difficult employees. However, there is many great things about this job such as: getting to know my employees, taking on new and challenging task, and running an operation from a management standpoint. The responsibilities include: the proper arrival of packages to our customers, employee safety, employee work methods, and employee pay.  "
good,"As a Air Supervisor @UPS, I faced a challenging working climate. This job is not easy in any way, but in my opinion it was very rewarding for me. I gained excellent management skills and knowledge, which I can now transition to every workplace. The environment can be tough and exhausting, you work in extreme heat during the summer and extreme cold in the winter and will be on your feet majority of your work day. You learn to tolerate and become accustomed to the environment and grow more disciplined as an individual. The benefits are great and allowed me to continue my schooling (scheduling wise). They also provide tuition reimbursement. Management personnel were a pleasure to work with, with the exception of a few (but you find that in many companies). There is also plenty of room for advancement. You can make a great career and earn a great salary here, its all up to you and your work performance. UPS is a performance + results = reward/benefit company. Trust that your performance will not go unnoticed (good or bad). If my passion was not for nursing, UPS would have been definietly been my career. I left on great terms so I will always have them as a back up."
good,"Job isn't to bad, employes are good fun to work with.Management is well coordinated and responsible in making sure areas are working and running properly."
good,UPS is a great company with strong core values and a proud culture.
good,"Has great benefits for both part-time and full-time employees. Ful-time positions take awhile to achieve because it goes by senority, but if you put your time in it pays off very nicely in the end."
good,"UPS is a fast paced job that is very demanding. The majority of the management staff has been employeed there for 10+ years, because of this, they feel like family. "
good,A typical day at work consist of me sorting packages down various slides that are then loaded into a truck for delivery. 
good,"Great company.  Great training, benefits and compensation."
good,I enjoy working here. It is a great company to work for and it is almost like going to the gym to get your exercise for the day. The problem is you can't rely only on this job to pay your bills.

good,"Excellent Company to work for,  Challenged everyday and no day is ever the same"
good,"Good place of employment"
good,"Work would start at 4 A.M. until 8:30 A.M..  I enjoyed the many opportunities that were given to the employers. I learned how to work at a fast pace as well as correctly organize shelves in a truck while loading 3 to 4 trucks at one time. Even though the work load was heavy i learned how to manage my time and how to problem solve according to what was given, and I also learned how to correctly handle and package hazardous products. As well as correctly and promptly respond to a spill of many types. Most of the  management was very respectful and actually very hands on and enjoyable to work next to as well as learn from.  The co-workers were just as informative and as enjoyable as the managers.  I would have to say the hardest part of the job would have to be the christmas months being the work load would triple and the hours would start earlier.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly work environment as well as being in a union.  Along with  the encouragement to advance within the company. "
good,"At work ill load and unload big trucks, sort packages and help others when there trailer is too full. The manager was very fun, and funny and i enjoyed working for him. The hardest part of the job was that i was going to school and i worked midnight shift. The most enjoyable part was getting work finished and Leaving."
good,"A typical day at work I drove around and helped delivered packages, It was a pretty easy job."
good,U.P.S. is a great company if you want to move up in life. The opportunity to work with others in a controlled environment and be able progress in not just life but with others is great. The best part of the job is helping others in need of assistance.
good,"My review is about UPS. I worked at a inbound call center. I assisted customers throughout the day with their needs as they requested. My work day began and 9:00AM and ended at 5:30PM. Most days were very smooth when handling customers calls, but there were those days when some of the customers were very upset about a situation that accurred. On those days I realize the customers were upset because of the situation and not upset with me. So, I took the extra time to do everything I could to show the customers how much I cared about their concerns, and how much their business was appreciated. Usualy the situation turned out very positive. I learned a little extra kindness keeps the situation under control. I worked well with my co-workers, and frequently mentored new agents and helped other agents with weaknesses in their skill. The job was not hard, but if I had to say, I would say not being able to get an urgent package delivered when the delay was out of our control. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was able to make a differance at the end of each day."
good,"i worked as a package handler and it was tough, this job is not for just anybody. you work your butt off. although it was tough, it really is a good company to work for and they do value their employees. i was fortunate enough to work with a good management team."
good,a uptempo work day was expected from stat to finish. working in all weather conditions wasn't fun at all. but the staff & management teams were tight-knit & very helpful towards on another.
good,"I go in around 4:30am Tuesday- Saturday, say good morning to my co-worker and turn on my monitor. Once I am comfortably seated at my desk I begin to input all information to prepare trailers, shuttles, and containers, for their departures, I also answer any phone calls that come in. When the first aircraft arrives I use a program to transfer all containers, to trailers. Then begin the weight and balance procedure. Throughout the morning I answer phone calls, inbound and outboud trailers, input container inventory, clear containers so they will be loadable for the aircraft. As the shift is coming to an end the weight and balance for aircraft is completed and all paperwork is filed in the proper files."
good,Co-workers were helpful and nice and the hardedst part of the job was working third shift and trying to go to school
good,"Had a certain amount of stops each day and you have to deliver them as quickly as possible. I have learned determination, quick pace, hard working skill and how to pick up heavy objects. Management was awesome, they helped me throughout the day and made sure everything was answered. The co-workers were helpful and showed me some useful tips. Hardest part of the day was to find the fastest routes to deliver the packages. Also a lot of stuff to remember while also driving during severe weather and driving. Best part was the money and the management."
good,"Within two weeks, I learned all the different tasks and automated most of them by using macros. I became so efficient that I had plenty of free time to help other employees..."
good,"I enjoyed working at ups good benefits, good pay. I just didn't like the fact that one person can mess up the flow of things."
good,"It was seasonal or I would still be there. The pay is ok when you are seasonal, much better if you are hired on ( which is impossible). Sadly for the most part you can only work here seasonally."
good,While working there i was a part time dock house worker and a typical day there was actually fast paced and fun. I learned many a things from how to handle different type of packages to how to prep the delivery trucks. The environment was all around amazing!
good,"My duties as a Package Handler included sorting, and loading and unloading..I HAD GOOD MANAGEMENT AND COOL CO WORKERS,GOOD PAY TOO"
good,The job was good yet it was difficult to balance life due to the given shift (night work).
good,"Regular day at work would be clock it, than make sure everyone has everything that they need for the day. Next I would stay busy helping out other workers and clean, until the customers started coming in. I learned a lot working there, mostly computer soft ware. But also learned to better my customer service skills. The hardest part about working there, was the Christmas rush. The reasoning for that is because it was very stressful and had to be on your toes every hour of every day. Also the most enjoyable part of working there had to be working with the people I did, they taught me a lot."
good,"presort dailly assignments, safty check equipment. to stick to plan and customers come first. Managment or very demanding, the co-workers work as a team. maintian a positive energy when exhausted. Is seeing a smile on the customers face ,and providing for your family."
good,"My typical day at work consist of handling roughly 350 accounts under contract with UPS Freight. I am in charge of over $2.7 Million in accounts receivables. MY day can consist of solving issues for large clients that make a difference in $100-$100,000 differences. I communicate with hundreds of different clients along with their third party payers to make sure accounts are up to date and in good credit standard. I am proficient in Microsoft, especially Excel which I use most of the work day. The hardest part of my day is making sure to organize and efficiently look over all accounts ranging from high-dollar enterprise accounts to the small business clients. You get to learn the ins and outs of the financial accounts receivable area of business with a large successful company."
good,"Small business setting, get to know all regular customers and know what they want and need."

good,Days go buy quik and work gets done when you get it done
good,A typical day at work is usually 5 hrs. I learn how to satisfy the customers by using excellent customer service to get there packages to them on time. Management is pretty down to earth and will not hesitate to lend a helping hand. The whole managment group are like a family. The hardest part of the job is getting negative people to become more positive. The most enjoyable part of the job is being he best that you can be.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in for a few hours to sweat, work hard and might occasionally get yelled at to move faster. I learned ups is a hard labor job and your body must be ready for a strenuous work out because it will get tested at its maximum strength sometimes. The management motivate you to work faster everyday and practice safety methods on a monthly basis. There is always room for advancement in this job and you get annually raises. The hardest part of the job is getting the truck with the heaviest boxes and having to lift them. The part I enjoy is getting a check every week and getting a good exercise."

good,işyeri şube değil acente o nedenle fesh olma durumu var devir alıcak kişi nasıl olur eski personeli çalıştırırmı bilemem ama ben yinede işimi sağlama alayım dedim..
good,i have worked for ups for 3 yrs never had any time off we have transport meatings regular but i feel the issues the drivers bring to the managers attention never get sorted i also feel im required too do 50 hours a week has never been a problem but i do feel the wages never seem too increase much with the hard work i put into the company and 100% commitment i give
good,"UPS is a great company to work for . It is very fast paced, but the hours are convenient, if you are only looking for a part time job."
good,It's hard to beat a part time job that offer benefits. The hours are either early morning or evening. That's good because it allows you to work another job. The evening hours can get old after a while. Management is good and supportive.
good,"Waking up at 2 am to make it to work by 2:45? I learned that it's easier said than done. During the Christmas shopping season you'll be getting to work by midnight or 1 am. I was a pre-loader during the morning, and then a driver's helper throughout the days. If I had stayed working at UPS I could have been a driver, or at the very least a part-time supervisor. You can climb up the ranks fairly quickly if you stick it out in the same location. The benefits that come with working there for a year are worth the wait."
good,i learned more from real world experience than i could ever have from classroom learning. taught me things that i turned out to be able to use and apply in my personal life.
good,"Trabajo bajo presión, es necesario el trabajo en equipo. Hay mucha comunicación entre todos empezando por el jefe de operaciones, terminando con la persona que recepciona las mercaderias."
good,"A lot of opportunity within the company of UPS, as long as you work hard get noticed and do your job the right way and you aren't afraid to go the extra mile it will pay off. I started as a delivery helper 2 winters ago, then moved up to a seasonal driver and now i am waiting on a full time driving spot."
good,start my shift. have a 15 min break. was really nice and helpful. all we very nice. adjusting to the weights that came off the trucks. just being thee knowing i was supporting my family.
good,"A typical day would be to get prepared by programming my scanner. Scan into each trailor individually as i entered and exited. Scanning each and every package that i put into the trailor. I learned how to build a sturdy and strong wall of packages. Meaning, the more you learned, the more you could get on a trailor. That would make a big difference sometimes. My sup was the greatest person I have ever worked for. We clicked from day one. Because, we were both very eager and hard working. My co-workers were mostly okay. I think every company has its share of slackers. Unfortunately! The hardest part was working three times harder than the slackers. I loved my job. Its nice to want to go to work every day and not dread it."
good,This job taught me almost everything I know about managing people.
good,Good place to work . I enjoy working with . Learn a new skill even for short period of time

good,"I worked very hard for three winter holiday seasons and enjoyed it, but the pay was low, and I felt overworked by the driver, who could have done more himself."
good,"Working the ""Twilight"" shift, I arrive at work anywhere between 5pm and 630pm. I usually show up to work 20 minutes early, so that I can get setup and figure out how to approach the night, based on the amount of work projected for the night. I then sign in to my computer and I begin to audit international documentation. This goes on until 10-11pm when the shift is over. On occasions, I am required to stay later because of the work flow. On a nightly basis, I interact with 20 other auditors in my department, and am in constant communication with my bosses."
good,A typical work day at United Parcel Service will be to develop and motivate employees in order to insure that company goals are achieved.
good,"Typical day is about 10 hours long. You need to have a love of people and dealing with customers. Very fast paced environment. At the time I was working there, there was some local disorganization, and my route on average has quite heavy in comparison to others, and I had to spend a lot of time reorganizing my deliveries for the day to minimize incomplete runs. Loved my customers and the people I worked with."
good,"Not a bad job. I started in May, and made supervisor in June. Completely perfect for any type of lifestyle."
good,"Hard work,fast pace, dirty,cold in winter hot in summer. part time 17-20 hours per week."
good,I helped drivers deliver their truckloads of packages to their specific destinations.
good,"As you get walked through to what seems like a network of conveyor belts, ladders, and boxes, you may wonder how ANYTHING gets done here, but their methods are tried and true! Its all fast-paced and rewarding the longer you choose to remain with the company."
good,"Overall, UPS emoploys great, hard working individuals who put it on the line each and every day."
good,load and unload aircraft and trucks. was a really fun job and loved it. Hours suck though only part time
good,A typical day at work was jumping in and out of the truck over 200 times a day. I've learned how hard the drivers have to work daily. My driver was a really nice person that was very easy to work with. The hardest part of the day was when it got dark and we were looking for the addresses. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting off going home.
good,"It is a very physical job that requires a lot from you. When you first start, you will get the short end of everything only because you are new. Once you start working there for awhile things pick up and it becomes a better job. Not an ideal place to work if you only plan on staying for a year or two. The real benefits only kick in when you have worked there for one full year."
good,great company -hard work and great understanding of efficiency.
good,I supervise an entire logistics operation that deals with quality control and hazardous material compliance. I have worked in the logistics operation at United Parcel Service for fourteen years. My expertise in the logistics operation is based on the experience of working and managing a large operation of inbound and outbound volume.
good,"a typical day at work was me working with customers, doing clerical work as well as computer work. and also working in a mail room. I learned from ups the ins and outs of a mail room and how ups operates. my coworkers were a joy to work with we rarely had dissagreements much and when we did they were figured out pretty quickly."
good,Load/unload aircraft and delivery vehicles
good,"Typical work day would insist in delivering parcels, i learned how to be a safe driver with excellent customer skills."
good,"You usually have to just show up, grab your scanner, and clock in. Once you do that you login into the terminal and go the your assigned work area and start loading and scanning boxes."
good,Good management and very well organised.
good,I meet up with the driver we go to different addresses to deliver packages the best part is the people you meet are very nice the worse is i want more hours
good,"Held Pre Communication meetings daily, review safety, performance, and forecasted results with my workers. Learned about operations managment and delagating proper duty to the right people that can handle it. Responsible for all trucks going to the clifton park/halfmoon area."
good,Good management and co-workers. Involves a lot of labor but you can look at it as going to the gym.
good,"At UPS, I was loading packages into trailers. I some times had to hold down two very busy trailers with little or no help at all."
good,Team oriented enviroment
good,"Sorting the mail for mail room. and placing in box holders slots. That took time in the am with about 100 boxes rented. Did billing every two weeks on mail boxes. Help when customer brought items to be shipped and packaged, or if mail, prepared for mail pickup.We did printing services for customers and helped when need if they did there own. My owners were Great! And friends of co-workers have been strong. I needed a fulltime position and that is the only reason I left and made some life style changes in my marriage."
good,Great work environment
good,The hardest pat of the job is adjusting to it physically in the second week or third week.
good,"It's a great job, with amazing benefits, but management has gotten worse over the years. If you have a strong work ethic and can avoid and tolerate management losing their collective heads, you'll do okay."
good,"A typical day at UPS required operational planning for the night and the following day, conference calls based on goals and performance, safety meetings, and one to one discussions with the most help needed employees. With my 3 years at UPS I learned more from this job as a manager than I have in all my previous jobs combined. The job was very challenging and required a lot of on the spot decisions. It taught me the morals and ethics of management, it improved my public speaking abilities and enhanced my training skills. I enjoyed that not one day was the same, and every day presented a new challenge. The hardest part about the job was the 60 hour work weeks with constant deadlines and goals to attain. However, this was also one of the greatest parts of the job as well."
good,I work the night shift which is 11pm to 4 am . It really puts a toll on me and a lot of people that i work with . I've learned that UPS is a fast pace moving job and requires a lot of energy .
good,A typical workday was fast paced but had to keep one people about doing their job so that we would not fall behind.I learned to that you need good workers in order to get things done. Some of my coworkers were great while others were in higschool and just really goofed off. The hardest part of the job was making sure that each package was scanned and put into the correct hub. The most enjoyable part of the job was working part time and getting full time benefits with great pay increases.
good,"Outdoors/indoors. Work as directed position. Don't expect to make money for the first couple months, with union dues and few hours. Everything based on seniority. Now benefits won't kick in for a year."
good,If you like sorting of any kind then this job is for you. You sort small packages to medium to large packages.
good,"As a first time worker, this was definitely a different experience. The great benefits that come with this job come with a high price as you will definitely work for it. This job increased my work ethic and life organization as it had very late hours."
good,"union job with security and top notch benefits, but wait is too long for a full time position about 10 to 12 years."
good,Gathering information regarding delivery times and locations. Management took pride in making sure they provided a safe work environment. The team worked tiredlessly to insure company stayed in compliance. The hardest part of my job was preparing volunteers for the peak season to insure every driver had a season worker. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting every package to the intended customer.
good,Punch in get your scanner and start loading packages till all the trucks are unloaded. You learn to work quickly and efficiently. Great bosses help you out when you need it and care about about how you're doing. Co-workers are nice fun and very helpful. Hardest part is keeping up with the flow of packages.
good,"Opened store for daily operations, supervised and worked well with orther employees, handled daily banking, closed registers and completed daily total documents. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the interesting things people have packed up an shipped out."
good,"This company is very thorough , in their selection of applicants , for jobs ."
good,"a typical day consists of loading numerous packages into a Feeder, semi truck, i learned that it wasnt as easy as idthought it be, the management are generally friendly and will usually help you out with most problems"
good,"I worked for UPS for 7 years in various operations and departments throughout the company. All things considered, it was great learning experience. They are exceptional at training people and have very strong corporate values. They also have excellent benefits. On the management side, expect to work long hours. Things can get pretty intense and if you're not a person that deals well with stress forget about it. Everything is time sensitive and each day is a race against the clock. Upper management is hit or miss. Everyone is either tough or a great person to work under."
good,The job I did was not hard more so one I would call rather enjoyable for I have never worked with transferring packages on a fast pace market like I was.
good,a part-time job with very good benefits. but not enough funds to live on
good,I love my job at UPS. Great work place and Great pay. Training drivers and driving a semi is a great job and a career choice that I made and never looked back at. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the cold and hot weather with equipment breakdowns. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I deal with and the customers I meet on a daily basis.
good,Very physically demanding and early hours.Starts around 4:30 in the morning.There are many supervisors and managers.Co workers are very nice and supportive.The hardest part is not misloading.The most enjoyable part is payday
good,"Love my co-workers. It's a fast pace and physical job. The hardest part of the job is, because of where we are located, the packages weigh a lot more than a ""normal"" area."
good,"I began working in International Customer Service, then moved to the hub to do administrative work. I enjoyed the work and my co-workers, and the insurance is awesome!"
good,Work enviorment was fast-paced with constant focus on meeting specific departamental goals . Team-building goals were a major component of the job.
good,"Very labor intensive work for numerous years before one can become a full time driver. Also this company is union backed, meaning numerous obstacles."
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. I work part time and get full benefits which is tough to come by especially now. The work is difficult but reading any review for UPS I'm sure you will see that. The employees are definitely overworked and underpaid. When UPS first started the beginning salary was 8.50, it is still the same to this day. You get overrun by packages and some days get yelled at when there's no overcoming it. It has great benefits especially if you are going to school but be ready to work."
good,"Nice, fast-paced Seasonal Job for the holidays. Learned logistical part of the job. Good for those not wanting to be cooped up in an office."
good,"Hard work, but there are oppurtunites to move up. Everyone is treated as an equal and fairly. I would recommend any college graduate that wants a start in sales to try and apply."
good,Loaded large shipping trucks and sorted packages. There was an opportunity to learn about the structure of a worldwide logistics company from the inside.
good,"Reading, scanning, and weighing packages and delivering them to their proper destination. When working for this company I gained a great sense of paying exclusive attention to detail especially when it comes priority and hazardous materials. A great cast of co-workers that worked with me in a responsible manner."
good,High volume call center that provided fast friendly customer service. Required to be full capable of using company software to acquire package tracking information. Trained to be able to identify and locate specific documents for custom rates and agents. Trained to scan such documents making sure that they were completed in full and accurately.
good,I loved working at UPS! Every day was productive. Everyone was very friendly and willing to help out.
good,- Keep my work area safe
good,"I enjoyed working with the driver - he was very helpful, kind and considerate. He taught me the proper way to do the job and safety came first. He was very pleasant and friendly to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with weather and lifting very heavy items."
good,The day starts off running. it is a very fast paced job because of the volume of packages that enter and exit the building. It is a balance of employee management and efficiency of package flow. It requires movement from one job sequence to another. It is very time oriented and skilled because of the process of package handling and package flow to destinations. It carries a lot of paperwork regarding employees and production of daily procedures. It carries a very good sense of job security with a union backing.
good,"We started work early about 3:00 a.m. unloaded 6 to 9 trailers every morning, one luch break for about 20 mins. Get off around 7 that morning then go out as a delivery helper at about 8:30 9:00 to assist the driver deliver packages."
good,"Typical workdays were very strenuous. I worked in the morning as an Early AM delivery driver. That shift began at seven o'clock. I was usually done with all work to attend class in a timely manner. This early morning system prepared me socially. It taught me to manage my time wisely, which in time also taught dsicipline. After classes, I would return to the company for the evening shift. During the evening shift I had the role of Metro Unloader. I unloaded packages and saw to it that the customer's merchandise was properly sorted to it's proper destination. Over time I took on the role that a supervisor would have. I was in command of three belts and four employees. Although I never had the actual role as part time supervisor I was given the duties. I feel that I was given this responsibility because I had a common bond with co-workers and that they had a mutual respect for me. UPS did not have any work that was hard. It was made clear from the opening interview of the work that would be done there. Working at UPS should be seen as being paid to go to the gym. In all actuality, we were paid to work out."
good,I loved working for UPS s.c.s. . Over all they management and co-workers are a joy to work with. The room for Advancement is ever present and always expanding. The management and administrative staff were mostly welcome to new approaches and methods on dealing with tasks and issues. There is a heavy emphasis on advancing and challenging hardworking employees with new opportunities. Most of the time this worked out very well but im some ways this hurt communication and work flow because the ever changing management within the departments. I luck to have moved up and learned new triads and skills.
good,"Learned a lot about business development function, how to effectively manage territory, handle tons of pressure."
good,It's a very busy atmosphere. You have to be very precise and to the point their isn't any room for error.
good,Never had one.It was a great job i loved it but it was seasonal.
good,Job Was Very Hard and hard work. It Takes Speed and consistent.
good,"I would meet my driver and co-worker every morning before 8am, i learned about hard work and the business behind the company. The hardest part of the job would be delivering heavy packages in buildings with no elevator, The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting all the different people"
good,You get paid to workout out its tough but great. The morning hrs was the best great people and bosses. I personally liked to go back to the job.
good,"I enjoyed every minute I worked at UPS, and I wish I could have stayed for the remainder of my career, but they ended up having a hiring and advancement freeze."
good,"managers are ok, part time with 5 hour shifts, 5 days a week. i come in at 11 pm every monday through Friday and i clock in and load trucks most of the night. my co workers are fun to work around. the management over all is ok, my immediate supervisor is a great manager. the hardest part of my job is loading the trucks. you may have to lift heavy packages sometimes. i enjoy the end of my shift the most."
good,"As a tug driver I had a fairly easy job. I had a lot of down time My co-workers may have been a little unprofessional but that could be expected. The management team also ranged from easy to handle to unmerited micro-managers. Overall, the job is a safe, secure union job but does not transfer to a good career easily."
good,"UPS was one of the most physical demanding jobs I ever had, you are constantly moving. I worked as a driver helper during the holiday season so I delivered packages to the customers. I constatntly had to run back and forth from the truck and the houses because we were on a tight time schedule. Not to mention carry and lift boxes sometimes 30-35lbs or use a dolly/trolly to deliver large items. Working for UPS taught me how to properly unload and load items from a freight truck and how the packages are boxed. I enjoyed the fact that you get paid every friday."
good,"U.P.S. is an ideal job for those who already have jobs(those who have either 9-5's or 10-6's preferrably) my typical work shift is 4:40am to 8:30ish-am. there is a shower on premises for those needing to go directly to a second job from here. Their ARE other work shifts but i have only worked the preload(early morning shift). The work shift is NOT flexible. the benefits far outshine the pay here as they are pretty good for a part time employee. NOTE: the tuition reimbursement kicks in immediately, like the first day that you start working. But the actual medical benefits kick in after one year of employment for you and 18 months for spouse/children. after roughly three years of working there my checks(before i put money into my 401k) comes to about $200/weekly. which many people may rightfully find outrageous. Since I started there roughly three years ago, the amount of work expected to be done in the same amount of time has consistantly been ramped up. While there are many men in their 40's working I would definetly say this is not the kind of job to work if your not physically up to the task. It is grueling back breaking work to say the least. The management varies a bit, some are fairly laid back but most i've come across in my three years are Ill tempered and almost constantly verbally abrasive."
good,Come to work get the job done and go home
good,"A typical day at my job consist of me setting up my work area complete with load stand, scanner, diad board, and keys to package car. Working at this job I've learned proper lifting methods as well as seeing habits while deliverying. The management and co workers where harding working and goal oriented. The hardest part of this job was labor, but on the other hand it was enjoyable do to co-workers"
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. There are tons of experience to gain. Challenging at times, but once you have worked here, you can almost do anything."
good,I really enjoyed working for U.P.S. The management was excellent and my co-workers were great. There was teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was inputting information in the computer. I stayed busy and the consistancy of work was great.
good,UPS is a great place to work for students and part-time workers. The work is fast paced and can be straining but that's what makes it feel like work. Management is very understanding of personal needs and knows how to balance a friendly environment with a get it done attitude environment!
good,if your someone who wants to work and pay for school or someone who wants to come in and go straight into management this is the job for you. UPS hires part time on all shifts and also works around your school schedule. A typical day consists of being inside of a semi truck and placing packages onto an extendo belt. You will definitely learn what hard work is but its a place you can work while you go to school or while looking for your dream job.
good,"Deliver package up to 70 lbs in weight,Pick up package from customer"
good,Large company with many opportunities and a great rotational leadership program.
