rating,review
bad,"If you don’t want to learn anything else in solar, this is the place. They will have you do only two different task. Look forward starting very early."
bad,"I was the liaison to the Philippines customer service team. Very hard to understand. Customers are not valued and it’s simply just a numbers game. Putting out many fires a day with people screaming and yelling at me is not the way I want to make a living. If they were a solid company that really cared about serving the needs of the people we sell our products to, we would be a multibillion dollar company. However when your  entire business model is to promise customers one thing and then not meet or exceed their expectations, it’s just a scam at that point."
bad,Dont recommend  to work for the crew but I like to see if another representative of the company would come to site and offer their onsite management skills to that supervisor he obvious ly needs to give people chances . Your not allowed to drive a truck better than the boss . He was jealous..
bad,"Self-proclaimed visionaries, writing their own press releases."
bad,"easy work day, full of people who think they are better than everyone else. managmennt tries to bully people into what they want. always hiring people to do same job as you but pay them more because they are ""smarter"""
bad,"excellent place to work, with off time work hours paid, cafeteria for less than a dollar the meal, and with many ways to make your self bright with your ideas."
bad,"Incompetent from the top down "
bad,Sunpower is always downsizing.  The people I work with makes the Best of what is left at Sunpower.  The moral at Sunpower is next to NONE.  Something needs to change.
bad,Poor strategic vision for the future and little to no fortitude to stay the course.  Poor Management Team with little to no communication with employees.
bad,"This was a door to door job "
bad,"Work life balance does not exist. I worked 75 hours/week. Too many red tapes to go through, to get things done. I've lost a lot of my suppliers due to miss payments and it's a typical behavior."
bad,"Good benefits and decent salary package if bonus payout is made. "
bad,"We work together as one,our group has team work and helping each other if one needs help on something. We're meticulous about detials  nor data."
bad,"Quand je suis arrivé, je me suis senti tout de suite dans le bain grâce à mon équipe de travail en comptabilité fournisseurs très à l'écoute et disponible. Ma team manager m'a mis en confiance et m'a boosté dès le début, ce que j'ai trouvé fort appréciable."
good,"Very unorganized and lack of training. This is all put on your shoulders with little or no direction. Even if you look for answers, they are difficult to find. The inner departments do not support one another and their business plan doesn't include keeping any field employees. They pay well but can care less about your career with them, even if you are a stand out employee."
good,"Travail dure , journées longues , 3 fois 12 heures par semaine ."
good,"1) Lack of work and life balance"
good,At the end of the day the company cares about money not family.  If your job can be outsourced you need to move on.  But the executives get million dollar pay checks every year.  HR's primary responsibility is to enforce this culture.
good,Was able to set my own hours. Overtime was available when needed. Workplace was not too stressful. Management was always there when needed for questions & answers.
good,good but needs some improvment. employees should i think commission only is not good for this type of job. More financial security for the employees would be helpful
good,SunPower lacks direction and it feels like there is no job security.  I feel the personnel I work with are fantastic but they are all afraid that their job is always on the chopping block.
good,There are extra task assigned w/c is annoying.The hardest part of the job is when you are duty during holidays. Always busy fire fighting. Too many bosses at the group.
good,"Hay buen ambiente de trabajo, un poco estresante en oficinas de ingenieria y manufactura con supervisores,no hay muchas oportunidades de crecimiento ni de ascenso ni de conocimientos, no son muy altos los salarios."
good,Good company to work for except it can be hard on your body. You have to be able to stand for 12 hours and work at a very fast pace. .sometimes it's hard to move on from one area. They expect alot from you.
good,"Worked as Lead Planner for Solar Power of commercial projects in East Coat .  "
good,The hardest part of the job is the ability to climb ladders on gable roofs and lifting of heavy systems onto the roofs of 2 and 3-storey buildings without any damages
good,"Five days work, day to day communication with the US stakeholders."
good,la verdad no es agradable se siente la mala vibra de los compañeros.

good,"The people there are super nice, and work very hard, but it is pretty disorganized. I was appreciated, but as everyone was perpetually overwhelmed, I was not well trained"
good,Management makes poor decisions. No clear process of work flow. Management does not have your back. Very stressful work environment. Co workers lack respect for others.
good,The environment of factory is good. They give me one buddy to teach me how to handle the machines and their safety while works is super excellent. They produced a Solar and supply solar for other country.
good,"I work in installation where I have learned the installation process in its entirety, to include roofing. The best thing is also the most difficult thing, though it is great to get to go to new places since jobs are always somewhere new, it is also difficult. It tends to be difficult to plan around not knowing where you are going to work from day to day. The company in itself is a great company and has potential for great things in the future. They are just beginning the transition to residential so have a lot to work out and improve upon where management is concerned but I have no doubt they will get there and it will be a great company all around."
good,Es una buena empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo buenas prestaciones en la que trabaje muy comodo y agusto.

good,"over all a decent place but changing all the time it will never be the same.  management was only interested in the money, not in people or technology."
good,It was a great learning experience in a brand new industry and pioneered quality engineering work at a large scale. Team was very professional and committed to make a difference in our environment. Difficult part was climbing hard to reach roofs on buildings.

good,"Préparation et configuration du matériel pour les nouveaux arrivants. (image disque GHOST, scripts etc…)"
good,"Is stressful but a great job and team to work here, I considered is challenging group and something a company with 24/7 can be demanding to your family, but the benefits are worth it"

good,Great company! Everyone immensely cares about the clients they serve and helps to create a fun and safe environment that allows everyone to be involved in their community! There needs to be more companies like them in the  in the work world.
good,I really enjoyed working at Sun Power. It was a great expierence to have to work alongside staff and be able to interact with students on another level
good,Working with Sunpower I was taught how solar panels worked and how the model is installed. During that time me and peers were instructed to build solar ovens.
good,"Working for Sunpower is the best moment of my career and learn all the knowledge that they bring to the table,I been working on comercial And now residential as a Senior install.its all about teamwork and trade each day as a family and the boss is the best professional electrical engineer I ever met 100% recommended"
good,Great company but needs to focus on management skills and need to promote people on time. Compensation is less compared to the amount of work involved.
good,Great Company with lots of growth potential.  Our call center is one of a kind.  You will be rewarded for your hard work and get paid well.  The company is growing!
good,"There are good opportunities to advance your a career. Management is very supportive of your ideas and suggestions. Telecommuting is permitted, flexible schedule. The company offers good benefits, and also provide additional training to continue learning new skills. You get to work with some great people from all over the world. But there is a lot of work, and not enough resources. Long hours of work is required to meet the project deadlines."
good,it is a nice company to work for they offer great benefits and all that but they don't really appreciate all the work that is done to their benefit. what sucks is being out in  the sun all the time and being out in the cold. the best thing would be getting to travel some days to different cities and other times to different states.
good,Being a newer company there were a lot of opportunities to build the safety culture from the ground up. It had it's challenges but overall it was a place to work and learn.
good,"es una empresa muy seria con sus productos, hay un buen ambiente de trabajo es una empresa que capacita constante a sus operadores, es una empresa ejemplar,         aprendi como se conforma y de que se conforma un panel solar y como se construye,          estoy orgulloso de aver pertenesido a una empresa que ayuda al medio ambiente."
good,"Good people "
good,Jobs are constantly coming in. There is always work to do. I came in on the ground floor of the residential start up and it has had its growing pains. But overall this is a very good company to be apart of.
good,"Typical day could range from completing scheduled maintenance to corrective maintenance on generating equipment and supporting systems. The hardest part of this job is coming to terms with inefficiencies that could be corrected but outside ideas are disregarded or not taken in to consideration. I enjoy an open minded environment that encourages new ideas and open discussions. Overall it is enjoyable workplace and all of the coworkers create a strong team. the most enjoyable part of my position is knowing that my work is part of something bigger, where I can take comfort in the fact that creating clean energy can help provide a cleaner environment for future generations."
good,"During most days I found myself doing a multitude of things such as testing, fixing CAD drawings, working with technicians, on occasion I would run FEA software. I learned a lot there being my first job. The management there was great they were all easy to get along with pretty much everyone that worked there we're great. I found many of them to have shared interest. The hardest part about the job was working with the government, because of that we had to do a lot of waiting on decisions. The most enjoyable part was the time I spent in the lab."

good,Good encouragement for the employees who to learn skills and develop knowledge in the respective field. It was a good experience while working in that organization.

good,"The job site was at a married couple's home. This was a short internship in which I had applied for. Although there was no interview, per se, there was an orientation.

It's very hands-on and educational, especially if you're interested in solar  energy."
good,This company allowed me to intern in the sales sector and provided measures well as other high school students the ability to work in a corporate environment.
good,"I only worked at sunpower for about 3 months. I was just a fill in receptionist until they found someone with more experience.

good,"I worked with the same VP of Field from Sungevity who is amazing.  The company has the most durable, most ethically sourced solar panels which feel good to sell. SunPower is a stand up company and they know their product sells itself so they trust their reps and don't resort to high pressure or micro-managing."
good,"I love working at SunPower.  It's more fun to work if you love your job what you are doing and the people around you.  Management knows how to take care of their people.
