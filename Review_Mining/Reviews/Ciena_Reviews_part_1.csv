rating,review
bad,It was an awful experience. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE........I cannot even explain how sad this work place is. Then they will have CNAs train with other CNAs that do their job half assed. Just sad.
bad,"Nice friendly people but managerment is clueless as to what you do,,,always stuck on contract no raises,,,overtime expected....clique like mentality so god help you if you don't fit in"
bad,"Employees are treated like a number and are disposable, they prefer to hire people on H1 visas and then keep them over the people that have been employed their for years"
bad,"As an engineer, you will enjoy working on their great products. Location was nice in San jose, CA. Coworkers were smart and cooperated to achieve goals."
bad,"Ciena is generally a good company to work for. My responsibility was, for the most part, internal auditing, documentation control, and business process improvement projects."
bad,"Management  does not allow career growth."
bad,"The San Jose and Spokane divisions of the company have released three consecutive failed products, subsidized by the company's optical division. Each has been done on the cheap, with an emphasis on time to market, before gathering realistic requirements or identifying the means to achieve them. The follow through has been an endless churn to correct surface defects without resolving fundamental problems."
bad,"This  is a company that strives for mediocrity. This is specially true about  the IP Networking team  in San Jose CA. The San Jose executive management  though highly educated is MIA for the most part, travelling the globe or working from home with no real output or accountability. Human resources is  ran with absolute incompetence and with no hierarchical supervision or checks and balances. This is a good place if you want to waste time and retire. "
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,"Autmated max config parameters.   Run test logged in HP Quality Center, our test case database.  Verified discovered defects and filed defects for non-compliance of Ciena 5410 machine Operating system.  Created test cases to verify the same."
bad,Ciena is a true leader in the fiber optic transport arena. They are dedicated to providing the best equipment and services available to their customers.
bad,"I worked from home and had to support a 12 hour shift and was on call almost every other weekend. I would get stuck on very long outage calls, sleep a few hours and then back at it again"
bad,Good company to work for. This was a temp. position.  Large company will  friendly people.
bad,"layoffs to cut costs and move work to India. Train employees in Canada/India and after training sessions ,US workforce is reduced for more employees hired in Canada or India"
bad,My day started with receiving all material and getting them uploaded and in the system. I did learn how to multitask by using different type of computer software and performing daily duties.
bad,"Employees are subject to arbitrary and insensitive treatment. "
bad,"If you want a job, you get it. The job will be making sure you let offshores do what they want to, maintain what's bad without comment, and approve even when you feel the lack of quality. You get paid. Lots of people who just want to just get into IT somehow, yes there is some small talented crowd, some teams good. These tho' get stuck with such industry novices. Quite some unprofessional managers who have been here long, and think they own the company, and can do as they please."
bad,"I've been part of several ""re-structures"" within this company and you're always left feeling nervous.  Management does not support you.  They expect you to take on more work than possible without complaining and just accept it.  Great co-workers however management in procurement tend to run the company lean and there's nothing you can do about it.  I enjoyed my time there because of the people.  This company uses and abuses you until they get what they want from you and then they throw you to the curb."
bad,"Ciena wants attract and keep senior executives, top tier management leaders and engineers this is where they put the bulk of their compensation dollars (salary, highest bonus percentages, stock options, signing bonuses, etc.).  Mid-level management, professional, tech categories receive modest compensation in comparison to the industry. Categories below professional receive what is left of the compensation dollars and only basic benefits, lowest bonus percentages, no stock options, no signing bonuses, no relocation assistance. Ciena has one of the lowest 401(k) match percentages of any publicly traded company in the industry. Although the latest initiative of individual base salary compensation transparency has been hailed a success by the company the question remains did the Human Resources Department complete the process with a "
bad,I would not recommend this facility to anyone looking for employment. All departments lack staff and support from management. Management needs to clean house because the old miserable staff brings new employees down. Very discouraging
bad,"Aggressive expansion (hiring, new programs, new buildings) based on exaggerated market forecasts leading to eventual layoffs.  Lack of advancement leads to good people leaving, those that remain often not motivated.  Ridiculous sick day policy."
bad,"It has been a nice place till the new management came in last year. They started laying off employees those have been working for several years and getting their own people and THIS IS THE TRUTH."
bad,"Watch out, This is a strong offshore hub. You can find your niche, culture is good enough. But don't expect standards."
bad,"Business model is not bad. But IT? I am surprised at those who say its challenging.. Yah, guarding the poor quality solutions by easily available less prices specializations, by offshores, can get challenging. Internal IT is a mockery. Only one way for advancement is by being a manager, approving the poor solutions. And some of these managers who have been with Ciena for long now, think they own the company. They don't have basic professionalism, openly threatening employees, who comment on the quality of the product. Ratings are based on manager opinions, than actual work. Quality people, if hired by chance, make sure they escape soon."
good,I find that working for Ciena allows individuals to grow in various areas within the company
good,"They don’t know what they are doing - after they let go their director finally things are getting better "
good,The pay and benefits are average. There was no room for upward mobility and layoffs were a constant. CEO would give himself a huge bonuses sometimes as high 78%.
good,"Good company, nice infrastructure but work culture is not good. Very much manager centeric company. If your manager doesn't like you , or you say anything that he doesn't approve u can b fired in a day."
good,Company has good environment to work. However there is push to outsource too many jobs oversea and employee dont feel confident that managers are protecting their interest.
good,Not heavy work. Ciena sells telecommunication equipment which are small circuit boards and cables. Nice people to work with and helpful. The work is detailed and every thing is done according to serial numbers as well as a part number. You have to be able to read very small print at times. You get a 45 minute lunch break 15 minutes of which is paid. Some overtime but not to the point that it is too much. The management is good and cares about employees and contract workers as well. I enjoyed working there.
good,I like the poeple at the company very experienced and friendly.
good,"A Ciena e uma otima empresa com um forte enfoque no funcionario, poderia melhorar na area da diretoria, mas os funcionarios são muito bons. O ambiente de trabalho e dos melhores. A Ciena me insino a perfeccionar meus skills em gerenciamento, trabalho baixo pressão e multi-tarefas."
good,"Good company, needs competent management. The company is going through changes and there is sending jobs offshore causing sense of insecurity to general employees. Could use outside competent management"
good,Innovative company with a true global footprint which is growing fast to become the top competitor in its market.  Revolutionary hardware and software that continues to meet customer demand ensuring the world can communicate faster.
good,Has been a great place to work as far as flexibility.  A lot of favoritism in my department and sending jobs to India.  I feel like I work harder than most and am not recognized for it.  I have loved my co-workers and have learned a lot about the technology field.
good,"Overall good, has its ups and downs with regards to different management styles.  Management  changes almost every year, so you need to adapt to each new style and each one has his own preferences and requirements, not always in the best interest of the organization as a whole.  Year end every year always brought layoffs which made it very unsettling to do an effective job."
good,"Ciena can be a great place to work if you have the right management.  Many employees are focused on making it a great place to work, but at the end of the day, if you get under management that doesn't have your best interest in mind, you will not be happy."
good,"Job security at Ciena depended greatly upon living near Maryland.  While California operations were moderately successful at establishing value for the company, Ciena tends to shrink back to the east coast whenever the market gets more difficult."
good,I choose not to comment at this time as this is inappropriate to ask.  Thank you for your continued support. This question is not acceptable for me to respond to.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: good"
good,"- good work balance"
good,"Ciena salary vs the industry is extremely low.  Even when Ciena implemented a salary transparency review, they did not help match to what the industry pay was.  Also, the work/life balance is entirely non-existent."
good,I put in the title a company of the future. What does that mean? It means they innovate and try new things to streamline processes. In doing so can leave people without jobs. While working with the company they do support you.
good,"Workable, benefits, health, vision, dental, good and workable reasonable management blue green yello black one two three four  learn import export logistics"
good,As long as you get your work done...everything is fine. Deadlines are manageable. The majority of the co-workers are nice to be around. We all help each other. My Director is great to work for.
good,"Ciane is a challenging and fun place to work, my day starts with a short meeting on what is happening in Ciena and then I start looking into network designs from Customer. I get to learn new technologies sure as AWS, Google cloud and Azures. The culture is like a family at Ciena. The best part is learning and continuing to grow in my knowledge. The hardest part of my job is traveling outside of the county."
good,"the company had a policy of profit, and your annual review was directly related to your profit pour the company.Otherwise you had full freedom to your choice of treatment etc.."
good,"great place to work. advance technology, average pay. limited opportunity. company made business decision to move Maryland location to north America."
good,"•	Reading the business process documents of business and drafting the same to oracle terminology."
good,"collaborateurs agréables"
good,"working at test bench"
good,It is a relax company to work with.  You will enjoy it if you want to have a peaceful mind every day.  But the company has a very mature growth rate.
good,"CIena Commnication is a company that will give you a platform to get good experience. Long team, I would not recommend because it will take about 3yrs to be hired or more."
good," Managing programs of up to 300 projects ranging in size from $10k to $700k using PRINCE2 methodology, reporting to the Territory Services Director."
good,"-Learned how large companies store data, manage internal information and communicate between departments."
good,I had the opportunity to learn about industry leading technology while working with the management interface team. The company offers work from home solutions and a good work-life balance with decent salary.
good,The benefits offered by Ciena are great. Additionally many team or departments allow employees to work from one to every day per week. Some things don't always make sense. For example there are several people who are paid less than the pay range. It seems as subjective as other employee tools.IT depends on your manager and the team you work with.
good,Great palace to stay on the edge of technology if you are willing to deal with a bureaucratic monster. A shame because the company was not like that until the Nortel acquisition.
good,"The work environment is great, smart people and flexible hours. However, the opportunities for career advancement are limited."
good,I am very much happy to work here. good management and good work culture and flexible timings.good place to learn new things.
good,"Great chance to get experience and learn a lot. The management promises a lot but delivers very little to nothing. Not many time and effort spent on improving relations between coworkers. A lot of pressure, as a result people are very sick from stress."
good,"I start the day off by checking my voice mail and email, responding to my messages."
good,"In Ciena I got a very good expousre on the Layer-1(OTN , Control Plane). It is a good place to work, with lot of stress buster activities through out the year e.g Team Lunches, Birthday Celebrations, Holi Party, Diwali Party(Big Bash), Team outings etc."
good,They promoted someone to be a supervisor that did not like for you to think on your own.  She was not available when you needed her. Always came in mid morning.
good,Ciena is definitely on the cutting edge of technology and leading the way in the telecommunications industry. They have the foresight into the future of fiber optic networking.
good,"Standard  Work hours Monday  to Friday"
good,"Good work/life balance."
good,"Productive, fast paced. Need to work exta hours. Good and helpful people"
good,"fun and productive place to work very accommodating when it comes to family and working."
good,My experience at Ciena has been very challenging and dynamic.
good,Ciena is a strong company with an amazing workplace culture.  Ciena is successful year over year for meeting its annual goals and objectives while offering some of the best benefits to it's employees.
good,"Ciena offers multiple attractive benefits. Good number of PTO days and holidays, competitive salaries, health insurance, tuition reimbursement, Gym reimbursement, etc."
good,"Its an OK place to work but nothing special."
good,Ciena is good until it is not.  Constant change and can be stressful for IT people.  New Leadership who is trying to change without a solid direction for the sake of making change
good,"i satisfy in field work , for doing my job full fill our management satisfy "
good,"Low turnover and internal mobility make this company perfect for anybody seeking job security and opportunities to learn."
good,"My job is flexible in the sense that I can expect anything at anytime to occupy my workday. Others within the corporation travel constantly, work long weeks. It can be a stressful place to work. People tend not to sue their accrued vacation."
good,A focused and execution-oriented company that drives the market in multiple technologies for the networking space. Very responsive to market changes and customer support. Some environments are high pressure.
good,"C embedded software development "
good,"I really enjoy working at BNR because this is a company that develop several product lines that somehow connect and communicates with each other. I liked projects where you would see a beginning phase, development and release to outside customers where you had a role to play in contributing to the overall project."
good,Innovation and Start up with a focus on Procurement Solutions
good,"•	Around 10 years of Total IT experience, including 8+ Years of working experience in Oracle Application E-Business Suite Versions R12/11i in multiple Oracle Application projects. "
good,"I was with an install team that cleaned up quality issues."
good,"good company, but hard to get promotion opportunity."
good,"I spent 16 years at Ciena, in 2018 i travelled over 150K in the air and 48 out of 52 weeks without taking any vacation, and achieved 152% of my sales quota, i Had a hand reconstruction in March of 2019 and the day after I returned to work was notified that my services were no longer required with no explanation."
good,"Ciena is always evolving and staying in step with market trends. Its promotes an environment that integrates cultural diversification and has outreach to virtually all geographies."
good,"Job security is not fixed if working on third party payrole or off-role. "
good,Ciena is a great place to work and have been there for 19 years.  The only thing negative I can say is that they tend to outsource a lot of positions to other countries.  I suppose this is not that unusual in current job environment.
good,Ciena was an amazing job for me after finishing college. The pay and benefits were amazing for a new grad hire. Training consisted mostly of watching videos and tagging along with other associates. Learning is done on the fly but the employees help one another when they can. Promotion and career advancement is tough in the tech support divisions (GTS). Even getting a spectacular review from your supervisor is no guarantee of more money or job security. Corporate is notorious for having periodic layoffs. Two months after receiving a favorable review I was laid off with others as part of its latest round of cost cutting measures.
good,"My typical workload consisted of 5-8 projects at once. All were different size networks with different traffic demands. There were at least 2 project calls per day, every week until the project completion. It was crucial that engineering deliverables were scheduled around your ability and time to complete. Always busy!"
good,"Management was poor.  Emphasis in department was mostly on ""buddy system""  Productivity didn't matter.  Buyout of Nortel product adversely affected Ciena Core Switching groups."
good,"Ciena values its employees. One gets good work exposure here."
good,Good company to work with. Typical work day is 8:30AM to 5:30PM. But work time is flexible and work from home option is available when you need it.
good,"Ciena as a company, is a nice place to work."
good,"Hectic schedules, hands-on learning, Management fair,"
good,"This company has a great work/life balance, but unfortunately there is little room for advancement in certain departments and the company has been moving positions overseas."
good,"Es un Buen lugar para trabajar, pero la empresa busca ahorrar lo más posible, aunque eso signifique contratar por outsourcing. A muchos les dicen que les van a dar la base en 3 meses pero no es verdad, es difícil que la empresa contrate directo."
good,Esta excelente el trabajo pero debería de haber contrataciones directas por esa empresa que se dedica a la manufactura
good,Typical cast of characters from legacy telcom sales teams.  Tough balance of carrier managed services and direct deals with not much help from partners.  Must be able to penetrate new logos weekly as the sales are typically one and done
good,"Challenging, demanding and busy which pushes for individual growth'. The opportunity for women to develop, opportunity to get involved in a variety of projects,"
good,Ciena was another very good client.  Their direction was very clear and they were very appreciative of my deliverables.  Positive experience all the way around.
good,"I have learned several aspects of finance Accounts payable,receivables, and some assistant to the collections department regarding account maintenance . My days are normally steady paced and fulfilling.  Management is good in some cases and the culture slightly different then the norm.  The hardest part in my eye sight is maybe the quarter-end process could be a little stressful and that is to be expected.  Work from home opportunity is given and the different culture of people is always enjoyable learning small parts of other cultures."
good,"Setting up OME 6500 optical networks, testing and troubleshooting.  There are always opportunities to learn something new about the product.  Co-workers are knowledgeable and easy to get along with.  Management understands the time it takes to complete the task correctly and are easy to work with as well."
good,"As an engineering intern, I did not have a ""typical day"" at work as my responsibilities would change on a day-to-day basis. I learned a lot about the electrical engineering industry in terms of design, testing/debugging, and final release of products. My co-workers were very nice and fun people to be around. The hardest part of the job was the debugging phase, as that could become a long and tedious process. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with very high-tech and complex circuitry."
good,It is a great place to work at Ciena. there are lots of challenges and learning opportunities.  Management and other professional engineers are very helpful and willing to guide if help is needed.
good,If I had the opportunity to work at Ciena again I would do it immediately! The challenges that presented them self made me a much better problem solver.
good,The company provided training and advancement opportunities.  Those that could do the work were challenged and promoted.  It was a professional job and one could become consumed with long days.
good,Ciena was a great place to work. Benefits package was on par with most of corporate America. Mostly good ppl to work with. I was very happy in my position up until the day i got laid off.
good,"There are lots many departments & many more things to learn. Hard to be a permanent employee but once in might be chances to return to work again but some times end up work & having breaks by your self, nice management"
good,"Working for Ciena/Cyan was an eye opener to the project management field I transferred over to from years in regional sales."
good,Like the people who work for Ciena.  Difficult to move from a contract position to a full time position due to varying work loads.  Customer business work load is in constant state of change.
good,"A fast paced, challenging work environment that was constantly introducing new and complex products to the market.  Great engineering teams.  Constant work with a good deal of stress to deliver on time."
good,"Opportunity to acquire new skills in group I was working with. Had chance for both on site and online training, but generally with focus of training for areas that you were or would be working in."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ciena. The managers that I worked for were great to work for, and the best perk was being able to work from home. I didn't have a boss breathing down my neck as I was a self-starter and motivator so it felt like I was pretty much my own boss. The benefits were great!"
good,"- Every day is the new day to work and also so much learning."
good,"It's very good company to work for."
good,"Ciena was a good place to work, they have good benefits, good leave policy and pay is within industry standards. Unfortunately the downside is they will layoff at the first sign of a downturn in available work for people."
good,"I worked on contract at Ciena, and for how long I was there it was a fine place to work. However, I was always busy so I rarely had time to chat. I'm sure it's likely different for full-time employees, but I just worked a bit and then went home."
good,"Enjoy working with good team "
good,"My career at Ciena lasted 14 years.  It was a great place to work.  It was close to home and I met a lot of dedicated people.  I enhanced my Customer Service skills through interaction with colleagues around the world.  I worked for Managers who were supportive and enabled me to grow, taking on additional responsibilities. Together, we worked tirelessly to help Ciena evolve into the successful, global company it has become. I managed the out of warranty material, billing between 800k and 1.2 million per quarter.   The hardest part of the job was leaving.  The most enjoyable part of working for Ciena was the relationships that were built with my co-workers, who became friends.  They are a great group of people who made an impact on me."
good,Everyone works well together.  Very relaxed environment.  Managers looks out for your advancement.
good,"Good learning, excellent facilities like onsite gym, good cafeteria,  flexible work hours as needed."
good,Overall Ciena is a good company to work for though this can vary from department to department and that points to one of the problems - it is a very siloed company and owners fiercely defend those silos from those who wish to integrate with them. Projects and Programs will stall out and have funding pulled from them due to this inability to work together - still Ciena continues to be a segment leader though these structural issues could cause it problems from a compliance and regulatory standpoint. Communication is sparse which allows speculation and rumor to overwhelm understanding and good morale.
good,The work day would include meetings with the customer to address any additional testing and the current validation at the site.  I had to update test procedures and documents for new processes.  I had to update application to support the testing at multiple sites.  I introduced new product to the contract manufacture for CIENA.  Ciena is fast pace environment full of new challenges.
good,"1. Best work life balance"
good,It is great opportunity for someone who is actually starting their career. The team members are very friendly and always there to help us to succeed in the role.
good,"Ciena is a Networking company which provides ample opportunities to learn various Networking technologies. Also, they have a nice work-life balance. They also provide support for extra-curricular activities."
good,"programmed,setup,operate large pick and place machine for assembly line production company a typical day for me i had find out what was being built set machines up accordingly and begin / start the line so the other workers could do their job"
good,Ciena is a great place to learn and earn. It has been a great satisfaction  working here and management is also very helpful to achieve the individual goals.
good,"Ciena has very interesting and challenging project in hand right now, All colleagues are very supportive and helpful. Overall it is a fun place to work. Highly recommend Ciena."
good,"It was a nice work environment, the people there were nice and friendly. Everyone seem to work together and help one another when needed. I wished they did not out source the Accounts Payable department to their other location in India."
good,"was an intern for one year at the new ottawa campus (kanata) and overall it was a great experience, so much stuff to learn from very talented and knowledgeable persons. Managers always try to find the best fit for your talents and what you eager to learn about. As a con I would say that people over there really work long hours (it was usual for me to be connected at 11 PM or so and see many of my team members online) and the salary doesn't necessarily takes that into account."
good,I have working for Ciena for 17 years now and have enjoyed working at Ciena almost every day. The main reason I am leaving is that most of design & development have been moved to Ottawa in Canada. Secondly my role has been cut tremendously. third I don't much coming to improve my career going forward.
good,"Flexible work hours for those who need it, including telecommuting if required. Open communications, great responses from management. Cutting edge technology and network management tools. High priority given to learning for both employees and customers, including technology certification programs. Fair pay and good benefits."
good,"- Good work environment"
good,"Great Culture among the organization "
good,Lot of Learnings and good working culture. There is enough flexibility and can manage work and personal life. Opportunity to work on globally Projects.
good,"A lot of the work completed at Ciena was fun and challenging. However, there was not a lot of driving force behind getting projects completed in a strictly timely manner."
good,"A lot of the work at Ciena was a lot of fun and quite the challenge. However, there was not a lot of driving force behind management to get things done."
good,"Good Company, "
good,Nice people to work with.  Lots of learning opportunities.  CEO is awesome. If you like working in a matrixed environment this is a good company to work for.  Good starting company for Interns and New Grads.
good,"I loved working in Ciena.. my coworkers were fun and my boss was very helpful and encouraging  ..he made work for me easy"
good,"Ciena is a good company to work for in regards to people, company culture and challenge."
good,Management is very project focused. Processes and tools used are continuously changing. Strong team work within teams.
good,"Review, negotiate and structure Vendor agreements. Prepare responses to RFP, RFQ and RFI. Review and prepare customer agreements."
good,"I joined Ciena as a fresher straight from college. I became part of the board design group in Ciena. The team there designed some of the most complex cards in the world. There i learned lot of stuff like schematic design, board bring up, testing etc. Again I had the opportunity to interact with other teams like FPGA design, Software, Mechanical and CAD."
good,"Ciena is a great place to work and build your career. Although my association with the organization was short, I learnt a lot from a management perspective and could also enhance my technical abilities. I was given quite a free hand in terms of building my team and giving direction to the exsisting projects."
good,This position was only temporary. Ciena was a good place to work. This is a large company. Always room to grow.
good,"But, it is telecom. Feast or famine. You do feel supported and overall positive. However, it is a globalized environment and as such one day you might receive a bonus with a salary increase then the next day your job could be easily eliminated because upper management decides to offshore due to the needs of the business. Suddenly out of a job."
good,The work processes were acquired and expected.  No one looking over your shoulder.  Everyone got along very well.  Opportunity to work from home on occasions.  that was a great aspect.
good,"Pros:"
good,You get to work with the best of breed advanced optical communication technology. Benefits are good to above average.  Very good management and the people are friendly and supportive.
good,management need to improve a lot. lack of CEO vision to the employees based specially in Brazil is a big issue. Some áreas there is no director in Brazil. Reports are provided according local interest of some older employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, but was pretty shocked when many valuable employees where laid off."
good,I have worked and many places and I find Ciena is upbeat and the management keeps the staff informed of good things as well as bad things.
good,Started my career with Ciena was blast and only company budgets was the only drawbacks. But overall great experience and education.
good,"A empresa preza por ética nas relações com os funcionários e clientes, o que gera um bom ambiente e facilita o trato com os clientes, gerando um ciclo positivo de trabalho."
good,"load truck for deliveries to warehouse, make deliveries of customer product to warehouse for shipment"
good,"Ciena was a tremendous company to work for. There was a feeling of ""we can do anything"" among the technology group. Leadership took a great interest in making sure the technology was cutting edge."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The people were very friendly. I had a great supervisor who cared about his workers. There was room for promotion but you had to wait your turn.
good,one of the many great company from east coast found the bayarea to expanding their name. Great management and company vision but at the end they decided to pull out of the bayarea due to board decision...it is too bad I got layoff from there....great time there.
good,"Ciena is a great place to work.  Their sole focus is to ensure the employees have all the resources they need to get the job done, and to provide top quality products to customers."
good,"Undoubtedly ciena  always encourages me and leaves no stone unturned to give credit .motivating and encouraging environment"

good,Kurumsal bir sirket yapisina sahip ama pazar sartlarina ve degisen teknolojiye ayak uyfurmada hantal kalan bir yapisi var
good,This company was more about sending our jobs out of the country. Had more layoffs then any other company i know. And raises were far and few between.There wasn't as many Advancements in the company for woman as there was for the men.
good,"Ciena has grown rapidly in recent years and their portfolio of customer is one of the stronger in the industry."
