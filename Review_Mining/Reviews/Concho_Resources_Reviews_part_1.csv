rating,review
bad,They have a good training program and people willing to assist when needed. The medical benefits are outstanding and their contribution to the 401K was the best I've ever seen.
bad,"Micromanagement runs rampant here. Managers use power and authority to bully employees and undervalue them. Very unethical behavior practices in HR, which leaves this company without an integrous leg to stand on. Lies about employee performance so they can do layoffs without paying severance."
bad,"If you have a manager who is professional and sincere about their intentions. The hardest part of my experience was working for a supervisor who would pretend to include but preplanned who she was going to fire. I was pre-warned by others she was planning to fire me and my supervisor before she took charge. She continued to play mind games until she was ready to strike. "
bad,"I used to love my job. The company was smaller then, there were less politics, and employees were valued. Many management changes were made, and the entire work environment changed overnight. Young managers with little experience were promoted and began weeding out people with different ideas and more experience who disagreed. Very toxic work environment."
bad,upper managment never gives you any idea of how you are doing or if you need to change the direction you are going. They do not back there field managers and do not talk to them about issues they talk to there subordinates. They never try to counsel or train them on what they learn to make there employees better assets for them.
bad,"If all goes well with the price of oil, then everything is mostly fine. But when the oil goes down in price, this is not a ""great place to work"". You are more likely to get terminated than laid off during a downturn. Managers in place have a tendency to ""parent"" their employees, thus treating them like children rather than have an adult employer to employee relationship. Benefits and pay are great but the company is just like any other oil company; when oil goes down, people get cut."
good,"great people work here for the most part but being located in Artesia, NM was pretty tough. Leaned a lot about field operations"
good,"Not a great company to work for if you enjoy having a personal life.  Has great benefits,"
good,The hardest part of the job was not having a say in the hiring process of employees that I supervised. Management were hiring friends with no experience instead of hiring experienced people. I loved the work and staying productive
good,Concho is a great place to work. The employees are great people and work well together. Concho does not work with their employees to advance them in jobs they would like however.
good,"lots of gauging oil tanks,reports of all kinds,lots of numbers. learned production of oil water gas most important and safety on the job was- highest priority.Management didn't like the way they conducted lots of their business.co-workers tried to help out as much as they could some were good some were bad.hardest part of job was trying to get production of oil gas water keep it the same or raise volume every day.to me the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people ,helping train new people and learning something new all the time."
good,"Have many years of experience, have the training, had a positive interview 8 weeks ago, jobs are still posted, called and left messages, but no contact from Concho. Very disappointing."
good,"The work day is routine and repetitious. I learned"
good,"Employees at Concho are friendly. The other departments in Concho seemed to be very happy and satisfied with their jobs. The accounting department is extremely stressful, but the people are all very nice. This company has thought of every way to make life for the employees as convenient as possible, from the company daycare, to the on-site medical staff and 24 hr workout facility. They also have a fantastic cafeteria, and a coffee shop in the employee center.  I really liked the available trainings and volunteer opportunities that were offered."
good,"Typical work day was fast paced and busy."
good,"Sometimes management can get in the way, but otherwise, I'd say that Concho is a great company to work for.  Benefits can't be beaten.  Pay could be better, though."
good,"A pretty solid place to work with the many issues you ten to fin at a corporate company.  Benefits are excellent, but the culture is declining rapidly."

good,Concho is an amazing place to work. The culture and opportunities are second to none and they truly take care of their employees in all areas of life.
good,"Solid company.  If I had to do all over again I would not have left.  Leadership was great, I just wish I would have been paid more along the lines of what others at my level were being paid."
good,"12 hr shifts for consultants, regular 8-5 for office personnel. The office is team oriented. They provide daycare services, workout gym and company doctor all within 2 blocks."
good,The people here are great and I believe they are the largest influence in working here. The Midland facilities are very modern and large. The work itself is good.
good,Good Company...is now large and very corporate. It use to feel like working at a small independent when I joined... the culture has changed quite a bit since then.
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday.  My boss and co-workers were a great group of people and I enjoyed working with them."
good,"Great place to work, love it here,flex schedule is great, on site Dr ,cafeteria,&gym. Free parking, day care available walking track. Career advancement available"
good,Concho is one of the best companies out there in the oilfield in my opinion. Never heard of layoffs here like at other companies. Bosses are great and they have a great training program.
