rating,review
bad,"No trust, no loyalty, sneaky employees and managers only out for them selfs. "
bad,"Do not ever think about working for this company! It’s all about favoritism if they like you... you will stay! Poor management poor HR, poor communication, absolutely No training, and I expect you to know everything they had in their mind as far as the way they wanted, no one appreciate you for your hard work...people come and go all the time and if you are not lucky like me they hire a new GM and they let you go to bring their people in"
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. I worked there for 3 years. I had benefits like paid time off and sick days. But they never paid me when I was sick.  I did excellent work for them and would go home exhausted. Custo.ers would give
bad,"Maybe it was just the transition from Carbone ownership to Lithia. Be ready to do it all on your own. No training or resourses. I was with out a computer for the 1st two weeks on the job.10-11 hour day, including Saturdays and Sundays. Commisions calculated in magic marker at the end of the month. Just unbelievable. Archaic business model designed to take advantage of the consumer and work the sales force to exhaustion"
bad,avoid working here at vw stockton management are so rude and think they now it all they dont even know the difference in the vw models selling wrong cars to customers and not going through inspection highly avoid this dealership if i was you go elsewhere
bad,Absolutely horrible place to work! The culture is sickening! There are cliques and you will not be welcome into any of them! Will get harassed by other employees! Absolutely terrible management and wouldn’t recommend it one bit!
bad,Kiss there butts to stay and make garbage money sell your soul to sell a new car and only get $200 per new car used cars where it was at the people that train you feel like they are entitled to car sales you start
bad,They don’t care about the employee or the customers safety all. They care about is how muck money they can make on the customers. Customers safety is not a goal of there’s!
bad,"The money is not what is promised,  the number one lookout is management. Hours are long for very little pay, they may say family oriented but that is if you consider work ""family""..."
bad,Everything they tell you are lies!  They state you are guaranteed 2500 a month. That’s not true. In reality you are actually paid less than minimum wage. I don’t understand how they are getting by with it. New sales people are brought in just to bring in more sales from their family and friends.  “Do not fall for the Scam!!!!!!”
bad,General manager belittled staff.  Hostile work environment. Extremely unprofessional. Was not treated with respect very often.  Treated differently and as less of a person in comparison to sales staff.
bad,"Very stressful environment. Management is lazy and doesn't take care of employees. Diablo Subaru of Walnut Creek doesn't give raises, worked there for 3 years and never got a pay raise or a review. Not a good place to work no moving up in the company. They work you but don't appreciate you."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Upper management and just anyone that works there in general they don't care about any of the workers at all it's all corporate owned and corporate ran  they don't care if you make it or not. do not come work here this is the absolute worst job they won't teach you anything and they're only  looking out for their selves. I wish someone could shut down litha. this company represents everything wrong with America.
bad,"Very sad company to work for. If you had an issue or felt uncomfortable about another employee and brought it to the attention of higher ups, you will get fired. If you ask how you can grow, earn raises, train for new positions, you will get fired. Management lies to avoid communication. They play absolute favorites and treat people like garbage."
bad,Very bad place to work  No training what so ever they throw you on the sales floor and give just a brush up of what to do.  Management does not care only 2 people on the sales floor do all the sales.  Not enough traffic to make a living.  Stay away!
bad,"The dealership I worked at lacked basic processes (key handling, service drive, parking, delivery, scheduling, etc).  Whenever we tried to tell the new service manager how it was supposed to be run, he would tell us to stop complaining about everything."
bad,"Honestly the worst company I ever worked at. Actually everything was great until Lithia Motors bought out our company. You are no longer a valued employee with Lithia you are just a employee number. They didn’t honor our union contract . Made drastic changes to our pay and hours of operation. The benefits are not that great and if you use tobacco you pay a higher  premium.  Communication is via email with Lithia  on the West Coast and if you have a problem you need an answer to you don’t get a response in a timely manner. They took what was a locally owned family dealership and turned it into a  corporate nightmare. I would highly recommend seeking other employment before thinking about working for the Lithia, Baierl/Day Automotive Group."
bad,like my job but only like a few people there. its a very stressful place rules change all the time no one is treated equally they give most of the work and hours to there favorits
bad,Took a great company to work for and turned it upside down and inside out. Cut everyone's pay in half or even 2/3. The long time loyal people were forced out through pay plan changes and unrealistic expectations.  Loyalty means nothing. They will screw everyone and anyone. Employees and customers. They don't care about customer retention. Only stock prices. They want you to work as much as you can and for as little as possible. Don't do business with them and certainly don't work for them. If they buy your dealership. GET OUT AND RUN! It's the beginning of the end
bad,"Pay was never on time, and were never the right amount. HORRIBLE management and couldn’t do anything to improve the work place. 10/10 would NOT recommend. Honestly the worst place I’ve ever worked at."
bad,"Management is poor and very unprofessional at the location I was at. They were sleazy, foul, and disgusting. Extremely foul conversations and treated employees very poorly. The company core values were not lived out in the dealership."
bad,"Had a great job for another company,was promised better pay and career opportunities to switch to lithia, so I did. have taken a 30k annual pay cut. Went from a professional store to a circus act to make managers money. Technicians are last in line for pay and advancement. System is set up to carry the inexperienced and non qualified to maximize manager profit. Am currently seeking employment elsewhere."
bad,The sales side is great in yorkville but as a tech at carbone dodge in yorkville witch was bought by lithia had no care for the worker all they wanted was peoples money people came in late left eairly. An hour lunch would turn into two and nothing wood be done they have none trained techs doing warranty work that only certified techs should be doing. They dont like when u confront them on the stuff they are doing worng witch is why i dont work there anymore.
bad,"The manager that is supposed to run the ship doesnt."
bad,"Lexus in Oxnard, horrible place to work for. Mechanics are not very knowledgable and just make half educated guesses. Manager does not know how to run the service department and cares more about getting positive customer reviews. Will write up an employee, threaten to fire for the smallest infraction and still claim he is a nice guy to work for. Office politics."
bad,Not professional on the Parts Manager when your having personal relations with your employees!! Parts supervisor very discriminating and picking favorites!! Worst place to work at!!!!
bad,"This place is a Joke!! Parts supervisor was very discriminating, picked favorites and worst of all if your not having personal relations with the Parts manager you get pushed aside!! Very Disappointing!!!!"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. If you like to belittled all then go for it. No organization what so ever. Worst management. Be prepared to be yelled at. Why do you think there always hiring.good luck.oh don't expect a raise, never happen!!!"
bad,"Service Dept. has no structure and service manager has no experience managing employees or customers. Service Mgr also has a smart mouth on him. Working here was bitter sweet, 6 days a week, 2 or 3pm lunches, 10 hours a day- I was originally promised 2 days off....never happened and it took 70 days for me to be a service advisor, when I was told 30. Tried to get me to duties that weren't my responsibility as a service advisor.....wanted me to clean up accidents-messes that other employees created! Company can't follow through with promises. They say they value customers but want to charge almost 180 dollars for fluid changes other than basic motor oil. Don't be fooled people you can get it anywhere else for half that just save proof that you got it done for warranty reasons. Too bad I can't put anything less than a 1 for this rating because it would be far from it."
bad,Worse management team I have ever worked for. No clue as to what they are doing or what's going on. No help no bonuses. Management is a joke.
bad,"They treat their employees horrible, don't apply here don't recommend it, poor management and they'll fire you if they don't like you. Most of the people working there are rude"
bad,"This is another Autonation. Your are just a number. No matter how hard you work or how much you know, they don't care. Upper management is just interested in keeping their jobs."
bad,"Prepare for long hours of standing around outside in the freezing cold or 100 degree heat. Shared desks and an outdated facility. Minimal training and minimal support by coworkers or management. If you are cut throat enough to screw other people over, this is the place for you. Good luck."
bad,"This place is terrible in more ways than one. Yea there are plenty of hours and co workers are generally easy to get along with. But the way management treats sales people like another number is horrible. There is no training whatsoever and you are expected to sell cars asap. They say they will train you but are always ""busy"" to do so. There is favoritism there as well. The finance department is great but the sales side is just awful. They give you no opportunity to succeed and will replace you without even thinking twice. Avoid this place!!!!"
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked, If you are in management you have to be there 6 days a week from 6.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Very low moral and no structure. If you don't hit your numbers you are considered a poor manager, Not you had a bad month!!!"
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR LITHIA DODGE !!!"
bad,"If you are not part of the clan you are worth nothing to them.  They want drones, not employees."
bad,"Sexist employer with a ""boys club"" mentality.  The GM is rude and they run the sales department with a fear mentality."
bad,"Fun job, not so fun company. Too much corporate politics. Upper management not so great. Like job performed, didn't like how managers acted toward employees. Horrible compensation, was know all employees were disposable, poor work enviornment."
bad,"I would not recommend working here at OC Lithia Subaru unless you are okay being under paid, under appreciated and over worked. Management here is a joke. They care more about money than you. Sales walks all over Service and Parts and will never be corrected for doing so. This dealership is a joke."
bad,"Unless you are a gluten for punishment stay away, the hours are way too long the pay is not enough and they are always looking for ways to pay you less! management only cares about padding its own pockets"
bad,Company has a habit of bringing in outside salesmen for company sponsored events. Floor salesmen get no phone or Internet leads unless sales manager allow it.
bad,"Underpay the employees below the minimum wage, 12hours daily shift, lack of management."
bad,"Working there was stressful. Paid by piece work not for the time on site. If there was no work, you had to stay with out being paid! The only thing that made the job bearable was that 2 other technicians were good friends of mine. I quit because of the dishonest practices of a service writer. I refused to perform unnecessary repairs and I got in trouble for ""insubordination""."
bad,"advertisement said 2500.00 guarantee and paid training, and balance work week, etc. one of the worst experiences working ever. Paid 7.25 an hour not 2500.00, was lied to by both Sales manager and General sales manager, always a reason to cut your commissions."
bad,"The worst place i have ever worked. GM lied to me about pay and what i would be making. I made half what he told me and talking to other managers, he told them the same lie."
bad,"If you are not in the good ol' boy's club you are expendable at a moment's notice at the corporate office. Disrespectful Directors who treat their staff horribly. There is a culture of fear in the building. Same goes for their finance coporation, Southern Cascades. They prey on poor people who have no clue how their high interest, sub-prime loan is structured at the Lithia dealerships. Very few people I worked with or around were happy with their jobs or supervisor."
bad,Left my old job i work for yrs to come and work For Lithia in old bridge to get laid off in less than a year employes felt threathen bye my skill .wanted to make this job long term .but made it difficult to work there and too make issues with management that was ran poorly. Lithia in old bridge needs to review there employes and let go the trash that still work there.
bad,"I have never worked at a place that on a daily basis we were put down,and were always to wait to do anything for example frieght would come in so I would start checking in and manager would stop me.I myself feel that team is powerfull and deligation is a key to getting things done. Looking for employement that wants to work together as a team and train if needed. What alot of people dont relalize that qwe spend more time together than apart.Iam willing to do what needs to be done and be the most time manager there is."
bad,"Lithia is a difficult place to work due to lack of training, long term understaffing, low wages for many of the positions, and very high turnover. You will be expected to work long hours and train yourself on many of your duties. Everyone that you need support from is too busy trying to get work finished and can't do a good job of training you due to high work volume and not enough people to accomplish it. You will be expected to take on additional work when staff quits without consideration to the amount of work on your desk that needs to be accomplished too. It is a recipe to fail. Be sure you understand the full scope of duties of the position, the condition of the office and how many open positions still need to be filled before you accept. If you do not have dealership experience it will make success very difficult to attain in this hectic environment. The more you have in writing regarding employment promises the better."
bad,"I tried reporting discrimination issues to corporate and was personally called out for it despite trying to remain anonymous. Was reassured that everything they say is just for fun and amusement and that it wasn’t meant harmfully, and then they proceeded to become more harmful and discriminatory in what they said in retaliation to being reported."
bad,This place is a joke you have people working long no weekends off just so management and  finance to chop up your deals I would not recommend this job .
bad,"They used bullying tactics to force fraudulent practices by employees. I put in my notice and ran."
bad,"Management was horrible, GM belittled every one & continues to do so. No type of appreciation or recognition, def just a number to this company! If you are not selling, you will def feel unappreciated!"
bad,This Place will use you for everything you got and make it impossible to advance i the company also if someone in management does not like you good luck on keeping your job or making any money
bad,"Its a joke. Management cuts a lot of corners, plays games with employees, random write ups just to be able to threaten you or manipulate you in the future. Lots of fraud incidents with warranty work. Management will starve out employees that stand up for their morals and ethics. Management discourages teamwork, wants people to be cutthroat and deceitful with each other. Management is greedy and wont give raises to those deserving. Loved working with my co workers. If you have any morals, self worth and a family you like being with. Stay away! They will work you to the bone and toss you aside when done."
bad,"Very competitive environment. The typical sales job. Tried it and it wasn't for me. If you're looking for a sales job and are experienced in that field, it might be for you."
bad,Training was not paid they sent through 40hrs of trainng with no pay. No interest in staff favorite were played. Not a good place to work. Other then that good benefits.
bad,"The manager who hired me quit 3 weeks later, I got almost zero training, was not shown around or introduced to anyone. People show up late, take long lunches, disappear for smoke breaks, and no one cares. 11 hour days, 6 day weeks, the a/c was broken during 3 weeks of 100+ temps.    This place is awful. Only the second job in my whole life I have ever quit without notice."
bad,Constantly switching management. Office politics are over the top. If you can work non stop bells and handle the bs you can make a living. No advancement opportunities unless you were brought in by the ever changing management. Would never even consider a Lithia store again.
bad,"In Roseburg, the management isn't all its cracked up to be and there is no opportunity for advancement unless you're related to someone in a management position. Getting proper compensation for doing endless mundane tasks is almost impossible, and even after months of putting in solid effort, time, and energy, I was given my first raise in 2 years, only to be at the same rate per hour that the new hires were being hired on at. Aftwr several months of being paid a dollar less per hour, despite my seniority."
bad,"this company has not changed its business structure, they don't care about their employees there is no support to new people and when you ask for help the upper management acts like you should already know whats going on with no training. as for upper management they like to through underlings under the bus when they don't hit their goals. very short staffed dealers no support no team work and god forbid you have a slow month now your an ineffective manager not human. bottom line is their is NO TRUST NO LOYALTY AND NO SUPPORT this company uses their employees as door mats"
bad,"management treats technician like slaves, talks down to them as if they are no good, pushes them to working long hours for little pay over family."
bad,Incredibly poor management. Hires felons who use drugs on company property. Discriminatory. Takes advantage of employees. 0 team building attempts. Pits employees against each other. ZERO willingness to claim responsibility for their own mistakes. Will find every reason to point their finger at someone else.
bad,"Atrocious appointment scheduling, all your daily customers will expect their vehicles to be ready by noon."
bad,worked in the finance dept no matter how well you did it was never enough lithia just cares about numbers and will fire you without warning like just before christmas. Beware they are buying dealerships like crazy and bringing in their own people.
bad,"wrote up for any and all  complaints  "
bad,"When Management changes, and it does often, the previous employees were reassigned or let go.  There is lots of Nepotism within the company.  No raises or rewards for long hours and great achievements.  If the management did not like you, you were thrown out like yesterdays garbage, regardless of your work, position, or time at the company."
bad,"Great product, great location, but impossible GM to work for.  Only cares about himself, no one else.  Without him, it could be a great place to work.  So many good people have tried to work there, but they leave or get fired by the GM, over nothing?"
bad,"The Management is the worst I have seen in my 25 years of working. The Parts Manager, in particular, has no clue how to delegate responsibility. This creates an unfair environment within the department where a few of the employees end up doing not only their own work but the work of others in the department that shirk their responsibilities and push there work on to others. The Dept. is extremely disorganized, which makes everything very difficult to find, and leaves everyone in a constant state of confusion, Again due to the lack of any real leadership. The pay is very low for industry standards. When first hired at Lithia CJDF of Concord you are promised all kinds of pay increase that never come. I would not recommend for anyone to work for this particular Lithia Dealership."
bad,This could have been an amazing place to work but the bosses are too concerned with stuffing their own pockets to take care of their employees. Change the higher ups and the grunts will be happier.
bad,"Making promises that are not kept. Pay plans that are never the same. Keep changing what the techs are getting paid. Management has no backbone to take care of their employees, it more about themselves and their checks. Good experience for the field and good people to work next to it is just not a well managed place to work for."
bad,If your new to the car business and want to gain experience and are aggressive then this is the perfect place for you.  But if you are a salesman at heart and don't mind the 10 percent commission with a high pack and flooded floor then I would seek other opportunities.
bad,"very bad experience for me but paid ok ,very high turn over,had some bad managers that always seem to be above the law no matter how they treated people,very bad morale for years company just ignored everybody who complained."
bad,"Lithia has a cap of $23/hour. I worked in an outdated shop with dangerous lifts. We lose air at least twice a week, and our drainage backed up alot. Klamath Falls does not have a high amount of business. Make sure to get all the facts before you decide to relocate."
bad,Enjoyed working at first. A regional manager was sent to our store. I was physically assaulted during a Saturday meeting after going to hr I was fired
bad,"This company forgets to pay you.... a lot. Like 4 out of 6 paychecks were either incorrect, late, or non existent. Only job I’ve ever got overdrafted from my bank due to late pay from (since I pre schedule bills expecting an on time paycheck). On top of that you are paid minimum wage and expected to work 12 hour days and weekends. They promise commission but forget about that! The dealership is in such bad shape business wise nobody’s getting paid. They have poor business ethics so all of their customers have turned on them and they don’t seem to know what to do about it. Working there is kind of scary because job security is non existent"
bad,"When I initially interview for this position the job sounded great. They presented me with an attractive and competitive pay plan and a great work life balance. Once I started and it came time for my first paycheck they changed their tune. They cut my commissions in half off what we had agreed upon during the hiring process, and automatically withdrew my first paycheck from my checking account. I had to go to the general manager just to get paid what I was owed. Do not work for this dishonest company, they will say anything to get you to leave your current employer and will pull the rug out from under you once you start."
bad,"I was a service adviser at a two different Lithia dealerships and they were both pretty crooked. The first dealership I worked for focused on great customer service through our service department and it showed. That alone carried the sales department of the dealership. The sales department was pretty crooked though with their used vehicles. Not fixing necessary things and trying to get things for free, constantly. Most people don't know this, but sales departments are typically a customer of the service department in most dealership settings. Commission earned pay for the advisers came from the service department as a whole so there was no competitive environment and we worked collectively as a team. "
bad,Training promised never happened. Help promised we got 1 person. Expect you to focus on company deadlines as opposed to fuxing errors that effect employees monetarily. Expected many years of a mess fixed and a staff grossly undertrained if at all in 90 days. Not realistic.
bad,Horrible place to work. Been with company almost a decade and am the lowest paid tech there. Your just a number to lithia. They don't care about you just there profits. Would not recommend this company to anybody.
bad,"The Lithia Auto Store that I worked at was everything that you hear about a car dealership and worse. Management was awful excluding one, you couldn't go to anyone for anything. It was all about how do we make the most money, didn't matter who we screwed in the meantime. It was 3 years of H LL and the only reason I  stayed was because i needed the experience. I would NOT recommend anyone to work for the corporation."
bad,"Leadership is good, my managers are positive and great to work for. Pay isn't great at all and there is no room for advancement. Also, once you get hired on you are pretty much stuck at your pay rate. No raises whatsoever. Benefits are sub par, and not competitive at all compared to anywhere else I have worked. Overall, I don't recommend working here unless you are OK with doing the same job at the same pay rate for the rest of your life."
bad,"People here are great to work with but management dont care at all about there employees or really customers for that matter. Money is the only mindset at this place, as soon as you are more trouble than your worth it's game over."
bad,"I worked making almost 900 dollars every two weeks splittiing hours between 2 other guys up front."
bad,"Lack of management, no regard for employees or customers. Repair orders that had been open for 2+ years unresolved. Customers rarely taken care of and embezzling."
bad,I really can't really give this place a rating due to it was a long time ago. Management has changed since I worked there. Other techs were always willing to help.
bad,"terrible place for employment, upper management does not pertain to the needs of lower level employees. service department is a complete nightmare, do not get your oil changed here"
bad,"Work space was great, but the lack of training did not help me keep a customers attention. I used my own skills and experience to sell what I sold. Management was decent, but not great. There was no communication between the managers and me, especially when I had questions and needed answers."
bad,"I worked for lithia Chevrolet for almost a year. The management changes every 6 months to a year. Everytime management changes they play house and change anything and everything that's suits them. Professionalism is returned with apathy. No care whatsoever for family or personal life, favorites are picked and everyone else is disposable."
bad,I was hired under the impression I would be trained with compensation and a mentor. The expectations and penalties would effect our paycheck including a bad review which isn’t discussed during the hiring process. Coworkers will lie to each other and there was no process of turns. Stealing customers didn’t seem to be an issue for them either which disgusted me. The part that bothered me the most was how the manager would scream so loud you can hear him through the building and I have never experienced being talked to in that manner before.
bad,The new GM is making this place not a good place to work. He hired some blond chick that also thinks she runs the store and he lets her. They forced an employee into a position they did not want.
bad,"The place is understaffed which means you will be working long hours. Worked 6 days a week with no comp day. Mostly the place was putting out fires, a lot of distention and the lack of quality work mates due to low wages,"
bad,This is a good place to start if you want to sell cars. They have good training.
bad,"It has been many years since I worked for this company, so it may have a different culture than when I worked there. The management is a major factor of my rating, and I'm not sure any of the managers from when I worked there are still with the company. It was a very high pressure job, and some associates were pushed to the point of being cut-throat to try and meet expectations."
bad,"Over worked, Some great people stifled by Childlike adults. Good luck trying to advance in the company.  Speak up and take your job in your own hands."
bad,"I took advantage of the nicest (most naive) customers you could ask for while being told I was a crook by my friends who I made no money off of, those were my typical two sales when I worked at Lithia."
bad,Quick burn out in finance in this job; corporate doesn’t care so they churn and burn so make the cash and get out. 4K mo guarantee but if you’re not easily clearing that you won’t be around for long. Hours are brutal. The good news is that if you give your life to the culture there are advancement opportunities.
bad,"If you are looking for a job to stress you out and pays very low here is where you work. Its in the middle of nowhere commute is very long. Customers are very angry 60 percent of the time, do to lack of communication and excessive wait time. Service Advisors are to busy to call or answer calls and the angry customers complain to people who are answering phones instead of talking to Management. Management passes the buck back to minimum wage employees to call back and get yelled at more. Its a circle of bs. No one takes responsibilty or willing to go the extra mile to make this place tolerable for customers or employees. If your willing to learn lots of positions and never get a raise work at Lithia motors."
bad,"As soon as you would walk through the door you would already feel your stress levels rise. Yes working non stop in a fast paced place of employment had its perks when it came to looking at the clock, but the stress you got with it was not worth it. The were customers who would yell at you for things you knew nothing about. The Service Advisors (people working on the cars) had very bad communication with their customers and I would get the bad phone calls, having no idea what was discussed between them. This job might have been nice according to my wallet, but it was not the place for me."
bad,"Upper Management that is corp doesn't fell or check the pulse of their smaller stores, needs to be more check in. Lithia is a great company, they really need to look at the management of their stores, when you have a lot of people leaving, ask why?"
bad,I’m planning on moving on from this employer and I don’t think I’m going back as long as they keep that management. False promises and shady work ethics. I wouldn’t recommend this place for employment or for services.
bad,"Set guidelines and expectations for job are not followed, management is untrustworthy, will say what you want to hear. Pay scale is low compared to industry standards."
bad,"not interested in the employee, overworked not a good work enviroment.   service manager was hostile.                                                        "
bad,"I experienced a hostile work environment with a coworker that my supervisor completely ignored.  Even when the hostility of the coworker was obvious, management did not seem to care.  In fact, supervisors and management either ignore situations like this, or they all together do not even see the problem(s) due to poor leadership skills.  It appeared to me that management and supervisors were simply interested in their daily grind without overseeing proper conduct among other workers.  Discipline geared at workers who most definitely needed it was nonexistent.  Overall there was just merely working ""stiffs"" in charge. "
bad,"The management was horrible in sticking to their word and love to rotate employees often. Once you're in, their goal is to get you out so they dont have to give raises. To them, new employees equals low cost.  It's ridiculous."
bad,"fast paced, stressful could never satisfy GM even when department beat the corporate set goals. a few did the work of many and the few who didn't weren't reprimanded."
bad,There is not a lot of structure or respect for employees beneath the management or sales people. But the pay off and the hours are nice.
bad,"Learned valuable skills; however most were self taught as ""training"" is a foreign concept to Lithia Motors. Management is terrible; very unprofessional which does not lead to a secure work environment. Pay is decent, benefits are good if you take advantage of their contribution to 401k and stock purchase."
bad,"I will start off by saying this is not a place with good management, furthermore the environment is really not that helpful.  The stress can be very high and unethical employees make it worse.  The tools required to do your job efficiently are not really there and when costs get cut the efficiency goes down and so does the morale especially when we get asked question about something that could be solved so easily."
bad,Very long hours should warrent better pay! Need checks and balances with management. Business should have an suggestion box in house that actually gets paid attention to!
bad,Management has changed what was once a family oriented company/environment to a hostile workplace.  It is very cut throat now.  Work performance is not rewarded rather than who you know.  Lithia Corp. was great to work for- they just need to reevaluate the local management.
bad,"no overly impressed with this company. buyer beware , i would not recommend this company. many reason why i am not there anymore"
bad,"Long days, short or no breaks, it is often pointed out how worthless one person is in the grand sceme of business."
bad,The job was not difficult. Clean cars and make sure the lot looked presentable. The reason it became difficult was inefficient management constantly pushing cars out the same day as the sale and demanding too many things to be done by at most three people while having to prep sold vehicles. The weekends were the worst as they were that heaviest sales days and as a lot attendant who has lot of duties else where on the lot would be reprimanded for not getting things done when there are five cars backed up to be prepared for delivery. Maybe it has changed since I have been there but it was not an enjoyable work environment and the turn over I experienced in the five and a half months I was there reflects that.
bad,"This place has zero teamwork, employees are set-up for failure then criticized when a failure occurs. the lead technicians only care about the gravy and couldn't care less if anyone else is drowning or needs help with a job. If you are looking to get into automotive, do not start here. they will throw you to the sharks."
bad,Typical work day is stressful. Management  will throw you under the bus. Customers can talk to you and treat you unfairly but you still have to smile.
bad,"You WILL have to ask for any raises and they will be pretty laughable. Flat rate is used as an excuse to not give employees pay raises, “want more money? Work faster.”. Multiple employees had been there over a decade without getting paid close to what other shops in town paid fairly green techs which I found to be pretty surprising as they clearly have enough work going through the shop and a high enough labor rate to pay people fairly."
bad,Eliminated the position huh? Yeah that’s a good one    Not a good trend to be following hire young pay less that’s the current culture here  too bad but that’s what I saw and doesn’t look like it’s going to change any time soon
bad,This Work place is very productive with things to do constantly but is also extremely negative and bad management. If management gets better than it is not a bad place to work.
bad,"The store I worked at was very difficult being a woman.  They pushed women to quit, it in the THAT store culture to treat them like that. The GM was horrible, one of the worst managers I've had."
bad,This is a very fast paced environment that keeps you are your toes. Always be prepared for the unexpected. The coworkers become your weird 2nd family.
bad,"Customer Service in auto sales, it was a good start, then I started to notice that my deals were being sandbagged by management. Other sales reps even noticed, so they just starved me out of my sales, so they could let me go for lack of sales."
bad,"Typical day consisted of being on the phone with customers, making outbound calls to customers, keeping tabs on appointments, updating information on calls, and relaying information. I learned that this is not just being a receptionist, but a sales job all in one. You learn how to speak to customers, you learn about the car sales industry and it's vocabulary. The hardest part of the job was the pressure to bring in customers. If you do not know what you are talking about and if you are not friendly and energetic-forget it, you won't be there long, that job isnt for you and they'll find someone else. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to know some cool and nice people, you learn what it's like to sell, and you get to learn about cars."
bad,"Lithia is a good company to work for, but beware: Departments are often understaffed for the workload that is expected, and this makes for an exhausting and stressful place to work."
bad,I don’t hold any ase certificates. But I haven’t an associates in automotive technology. Started at the bottom off the pole. Was asked many times about going to training. And asked about it many times. But it was only a question. Nothin went further on it. Pay scale for a lube  tech is ridiculous.
bad,I loved loved loved my managment. Although he never negatively managed he is easy to talk to. Then I got a demotion because they got rid of my position. And a ginormous pay decrease. Which is ridiculous. The store I was at is in a limbo and lower employees are taking the bad side of it.
bad,"Good company with somewhat competitive benefits plan. If you get on with a Lithia store that has a good manager then you get a 5 star rating, however for my experience I did not receive that. I had a manager that would turn away car deals because he wouldn't price match when he tells you to email customers that we have a price match or beat guarantee. Making customers label us as shady, which is not fair to you as the sales person. My manager would also split my car deals with people who had nothing to do with it. I'm all for helping out a coworker but when someone isn't even in the dealership on that day then its simply ridiculous. Also there is no option for advancement and it simply is  if you are friends with the GM you will move up, other than that you are screwed. Pay plan changed 3 times within my first month working for the company and we were told by our manager that it was changing to Hourly plus bonus and then when we asked about it he said that it was never that but we have paperwork that documents otherwise. Loaded money onto the back gross so sales associates didn't get to make money even if they hit their numbers, I know that because I hit multiple times but still only got an hours check. Find the management you think you will mesh well with and ask other employees about how it is to work their before you accept any offers."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Lithia. The pat was good, and I got plenty of overtime, but my position was taken for granted and I was treated unfairly by management."
bad,"The Detail area of Lithia has poor light and you are not able to see a lot of the dirt in a vehicle unless you take a vehicle outside, up a hill, and then in front of the showroom before you are able to see something.  The person who takes pictures of the vehicles will belittle the detailer if there is something wrong with a vehicle then if that person feels that you are not doing a good job will not tell you what you are missing as a detailer and will just start taking vehicles to the service manager so that he will start bringing vehicles down so that you can redo vehicles."
bad,"a typical day was to sell work,cashier customers,lot porter. i learned managagment  skills. the coworkers i enjoyed being around. the upper managment (not local sucked)"
bad,It was hard for me to want to work as a lube tech when working flat rate. I was unable to make any money while working there. I did not get enough jobs somedays.
bad,"They tell you to do things one way, then tell you to do it the opposite of what they told you previously."
good,Given that you make about 800ish every 2 weeks for 120 hours because it's flag rate pay.  Its Not all bad.  Decent people to work with and decent company to work for.
good,It was nice at the start but poor management and poor pay made me leave. Managers seem to take out there personal problems on employees which makes for a very unpleasant work environment. No room for advancement because of low pay and to much of a work overload and stress from management. Promotions here are not worth it. The parts manager is on her cell phone all day and always has a bad attitude. None of the departments get along or respect one another. This place just has constant drama and stress.
good,Management at the store level is completely incompetent and unethical. They don't care about their employees or their customers. They rip people off and are always doing things that are against the law or violate company policy.
good,"I met some great people while working at Mercedes of Portland, however the Service Department was poorly managed once my hiring manager left for a better opportunity."
good,"must have the shark attitude, be a vulture, do not be afraid to chase people away. your not there to make friends although you will, but they will take a sale from you the moment they can."
good,Would not recommend for a place to go to work. Favoritism reeks at this place.  When you try to be honest they let you go. Always threatening to fire you if your quota is not met.
good,"I went from sales to the BDC (specialized call center). It was more of a lateral move and it was recently shut down. Sales was way too many hours for too many moving target goals. It didn't help that the previous management ran the place nearly into the ground and our ""sister store"" was definitely in better standing with the parent company."
good,Co-workers were good guys.  My supervisors were very unorganized. Would be told by one to do one thing and then another would come by and tell us something totally different.
good,"You are not viewed as a person with a life outside of work or having a family. You are treated only as a number. You are expected to be at work a minimum of 6 days a week, 12+ hours a day."
good,"pay structure is not good at all. you might spend 5-6 or more hours with a customer showing product, negotiating price, financing vehicle, and prepping car for delivery all for just a $125 ""mini' payout. and if that's your only sale for the entire day which sometimes is up to 10-11 hours that's ALL your making because the ""hourly rate"" they promise you is just a like a loan. because of the structure of the pay. you either get paid commission OR hourly, whichever is greater because they don't feel you deserve both."
good,"Manager deligates, but does not manage. Far to many people have hands on files, thus mistakes on paperwork are a daily struggle. Shop is on the verge of loosing a million dollar account due to lack of management, thus not enough work to go around."
good,"I enjoyed waking up knowing that it was going to be a busy day. I learned a lot from what I understand two roles of being in the office. Apparently there is supposed to be a person that checks and posts deals and a title clerk. I do believe that if the Office would expand with the number of employees vs the number of tasks per person that would be great benefit to the production and expectations."
good,"It was good place to leran a lot about how the auto sales industry works,"
good,It was great untill management switch they offered classes to become certified Mopar mechanic. The cons were the service advisors would favour certain people and not hand out jobs evenly.
good,"Underpaid - overworked - its just that simple"
good,"They have a culture to work people hard, with the intent to turn them with in three years. Pay stays relatively the same if you are experienced vs. new. Company motto when I was there was more work less pay. They would say it as a joke but it was true. Rarely will you see someone get promoted from within. They usually higher managers from the outside. Because of the high turn and the relatively new and inexperienced staff it does allow you to get into positions that would normally be filled with more experienced people. That is why Lithia is a great place to get experience because you get exposed to things earlier than you would have otherwise. On the downside you will be self trained,."
good,Its unfortunate the way things played out. I loved working for Lithia. I just didn't love the way Management / HR handled things. I followed all specific guidelines and still caught the blame for managements mistakes
good,lack of communication in the service department makes for a difficult day to day. current management is not great. not the worst place I've been though.
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working at this place. I was taken advantage for being bilingual but not paid what I deserve, too many tasks for one person, manager is rude."
good,Lithia as a company is large and provides a good benefits package that is employee paid. It is a high volume dealership that moves alot of vehicles through it.
good,I showed up everyday ready to work however the management did not like me. They would continue to give me the worst projects if they wanted me to quit my job.
good,"The income was good to support myself, the only raise that would have been given to me would have reduced my income.  Further more it seems the company punished the good employees for mistakes and shoved the bad employees mistakes underneath the rug.  The co-workers in the lube bay, other technicians were decent to work with, we laughed and joked with no problems.  The hardest part of the job was the work load that we had to deal with on top of basically getting told we were going too slow and needed to speed up  when we were already running 100 miles a minute.  The only enjoyable aspect of the job besides some friendly co-workers was the paycheck."
good,"This particular dealership is big on promises, weak on delivering them.   My advice, if you go in getting things promised, make sure they're in writing.  These folks will tell you anything to get you there, then nothing to keep you there."
good,This was a retail car sales position in a very small metro area.
good,"None of the managers are on the same levels when it comes to training, they all have their own views on how things are done but you done know what that it until you being yelled at. Their is no actual training available, they just throw you with another sales person which makes them mad cause it slows down their process and loses them money."
good,"Lots of Promises given at hire with very little to most the time no follow through. There was lots of plans at hire but when the time came to follow through there was no ""paper trail."" The Shop is slow and unfortunately hard to pay bills."
good,Professional training. Minimum pay security. Many different dealerships to work at or transfer to. Generally good working staff. Many fun events - personal and professional.
good,"Its a pretty typical corporate environment. The management is ""okay"", there does appear to be a communication barrier. The culture that is preached is great, but the ""practice"" of it isn't perfect. Hardest part of the job is the lack of communication from other and lack of development. Most enjoyable part of the job and company are the regular staff."
good,Lithia is a male dominant work area where the receptionist is one of the few females in the show room at the time besides the customers. Some days you can be slammed by licence plates and paperwork and other days you can be sitting there just greeting people. Once you become friends with the sales team the job is a lot more fun and easy going. The management is not that great since there is always a change in staff so things can get a little scrambled.
good,"When i worked there there was no management structure or any form of real training, just throw you out there and sell, if you fail you are fired!! The employees were pretty cool though."
good,Great experience. I learned a lot and it was a wonderful opportunity. It was a hard position to come into without prior experience though.
good,"A typical work day begins at 8am, I would clock in and go over follow up information from the day prior, meet and greet at the service drive for 1hr, make follow up phone calls, make service lead phone calls, set appointments, cover the dealership for potential business, work until 9pm. I learned how to organize better and become more proactive in bringing in business. Although sales can be very competitive co-workers are friendly, making cold calls is the hardest part of the car business, it becomes a numbers game, normally 15 out of 30-40 phone calls are answered and 5 out of 15 would set appointments and 3 out of 5 would attempt to buy. The most enjoyable part of car sales is the product knowledge, learning about something I love."
good,"Poor pay plan"
good,Clean area with nice friendly workers. Management is good. Safe enviroment to work in. Meets osha requirement. Easy way to work your way up in the automotive field.
good,"I have a lot more cons then I do pros working here sadly. CONS: One, the salary does not allow anyone to live off of without being pay check to paycheck and then were being paid every two weeks, makes it that much harder. Working so many hours (full time), there's no way to get a side job to help with living expenses. Two, there doesn't seem to be any way to elevate and move up here. Everyone is stuck in there ways. Three, there is HUGE favoritism. Its spotted so quickly and its very disgusting. Four, sharing one parking lot for numerous companies is horrible. Never any parking after 8am and 1/2 the time forced to park on the street and pay meter or move vehicle every few hours. PROS: I love this brand (Mercedes Benz). The vehicle's are really out of this world and to be able to learn about them everyday is really a treat. Uniforms are given out, most of the employees are cordial, and working downtown is a lovely sight."
good,"I got paid by the car (piece work) if the service adviser was have a bad day, he wouldn't put you employee number down, and you wouldn't get paid for that car."
good,"I had only work at this establishment for a couple months and as such didn't felt I managed to get the most out of the experience. My typical job included oil changes and tire rotations on vehicles, with promises of advancements. However, after only a few months of employment they had already notified that they were likely to let me go instead."
good,"not for everyone"
good,"I loved handling the money. Worked with the sale representative and customer. Printing out their invoice. We had the shop if they needed repairs for their vehicle, printed out the invoice and gave them a copy for the customer along with a copy to be processed to the financial managers desk for warranty prepossess."
good,"Typical day 9-7pm, learned about 37 different models and options."
good,This is a difficult place to work. Nobody takes responsibility for their actions and try to put blame on everyone but who is actually responsible. Cant trust anyone. The way work is scheduled is not organized at all. Lots of customers angered by dumb service advisors.
good,"Loved a lot of people I worked with, but management was terrible. Pay was really great, but overall was not worth the work. A lot of people did not take their jobs seriously and it made work 10 times harder for the people that did."
good,"I worked with a good team and they aimed to achieve a fun work environment. The overall was ok, not above and beyond in any way. The time off and benefits were less than standard. However they did offer employees and their spouse free access to a clinic for basic health care. For me that was the best thing they had."
good,"As a new car salesperson you often have to put in 14 hour days.  This is a good job if you are enthusiastic, charismatic, and have a good working knowledge about cars and trucks."
good,Too many hours. 60 + hour work weeks with little flexibility. This is an antiquated business model and they follow it simply because that is the way it has always been done.
good,"I've worked here for just over a year as a make ready detailer/supervisor. It's an easy job, but they could pay more for everything that we are required to do. Some days tho are really easy and relaxed. While others are kind of hectic. Most of the problems are lack of communication. Plus side, is the managers here are understanding if you need to leave for family or personal reasons."
good,"Service Advisors have long days - 7:30am-6:00 with alternating Saturdays. Meeting and helping clients was the most fun, catching up with  clients whom you've helped for years.  never a boring moment.  Hardest part of the day was the Culture. It had begun very upbeat with management that was interested in your day and helping you achieve your personal goals, soon changed to close doors.  Rules did not apply to all employees"
good,good temporary job some people stay for a couple weeks and others stay for a long time. some people just get fired on the spot no two weeks. sometimes there is a company picnic
good,Lithia changed a lot not a big fan of a lot of the changes. Day was not a bad comoany to work for had ups and downs like all companies. Definitely a different company to work for with all new changes but changes can be hard in any company
good,Worked remotely on corporate level. Could not apply full spectrum of learning for 6 weeks. Tech issues hindered productivity. Training was given out of state. Ongoing support was minimal and patience was non-existant.
good,"lithia was not to bad it was ok at best. Most people worked there not to bad of people. It is the car biz you will make ok money ,they have more going for them than most car lots."
good,"very busy days, service manager is an unpleasant man, co-workers are great."
good,"extreme high pressure sales environment, little concern for the customer, constant intimidation of all employees and lower level management made for poor working conditions."
good,It’s an ok place to work. Winter times really slow down work flow. Overall not bad . Summer times are pretty productive. Great employees to work with.
good,The corporation as a whole is not terrible but not the greatest either. The health insurance is very expensive but it does cover a lot. Management is terrible at the pocatello location. All they care about is money and all you are to them is a number.
good,"It is a fast-paced and competitive environment with friendly staff and decent management. Certain expectations are required so it becomes difficult to meet sometimes. I learned at lot from both the job and the staff, so it was a good experience overall."
good,Fun at times but didn’t get treatEd well. Long days and hours for small pay. Not worth the stress to work for a company who doesn’t treat you well for low amount of money.
good,"Could be better. Not a fan of the transition after the acquisition. No one is held accountable for unethical behavior. Overall company practice is “do as I say, not as I do.” Definitely not a fan of the over excessive workload in comparison to the barely minimal wage salary."
good,"You can certainly make a six figure income in this business but be ready to put in a ton of hours. Working nights, weekends, and holidays is the norm and expected."
good,Lithia is not a bad company to work for but the problem is they're a corporation. Making money is their main focus and if they have to run you over to do it they will. Employees come second and promises usually arent kept.
good,Ok place to work when I was there. Some of the staff were a little mean/cutthroat due to care competition. Some also liked to gossip which I didn't like.
good,Lithia is a large corporation with approximately 185 locations(and growing) that allows each dealership to operate autonomously so my experiences may differ greatly than those of someone in another location.  I enjoyed my work and working with my coworkers but the location I was in went through four General Managers in the four years I was there and none of them were successful in growing the new car sales end of the store.
good,"About Management: they are very courteous to you but they only tell you what you want to hear.  They respect you as a person, but if your not the most productive person on the floor you are not really worthy of their time and energy.    As long as your producing they don't really care who's throat you have to cut to produce numbers.  They  are also unwilling to change to a more modern system, everything is still paper and looks unprofessional in my opinion.  "
good,"It's a job.  Not a career. It can be but it's mostly dead end. Advancement only happens to the lucky. You can be awarded for a job well done but it's all a popularity contest.  Managers expect more and more responsibility out of you without increased time or help, setting impossible standards. You can literally be written up as a way to make you do something i.e. change your shifts to suit others"
good,couldn't seem to get things figured out with transition. what was promised wasn't received. roll hired for wasn't feasible for the company.............
good,For the most part it was a descent place to work. A little bit of micro management. Benefits were very good as well. I ejoyed the coworkers and they would always help you even if they were at another store since they all made Lithia use a common language.
good,"Annually review award meeting. Prizes, games and good food. Incentives for finding cost saving measure. Medical, Dental and Vision Plans"
good,"Setting 8 appointments per day to meet goal per management was complexed from day to day. Nothing constant but change. Appointments not showing up or canceling or not able to buy when they did show up due to credit, or money issues. This affects your goal and bonus structure."
good,this place is alright if you are barley getting into the automotive industry it has great working environment great people to work with but the pay is a little disappointing. ive learned a lot about responsibility and getting work done over the seven months ive been working there but the hardest part of the job is trying to not stress when it gets busy but overall like i said its a learning expirience
good,Being the new techno way of selling cars it was a bust. Seeking to avoid overhead this system utilized computer make up of cars and then sought out vehicle at another company facility.
good,"There are several very nice and wonderful people to work with and around. Management does not seem to truly value the technicians. Techs are paid on flat rate yet the hours vs pay never seem to fully add up. The facility was built as a satellite store, but the GM is trying to run it as a stand alone. The service bay has 12 stalls, so things are cramped. Over all I would say if you weigh the good and bad about Lithia. There are worse and better places to work. The potential to be the best place to work in the state is there. If management and corporate office will just get out of their own way."
good,if it weren't for working on strictly flag hours I would go back to Lithia in a heart beat they were always willing to teach me new things and over all was just a great place to work never had any problems
good,Fast paced but the office manager is not qualified to do their job.T he office manager at the location that I was at is an idiot and did not earn the position. Two faced managers and no job security
good,fair car company with a history of doing quite well in profits.  many facets of the company and chances of advancing.  a fair start for a company
good,Not so good work environment. Stressful each day after working there 6 months. Drama every week ND no lunches for lube techs.
good,"As accounts payable I was responsible for paying invoices for the dealership. I handled interoffice trades (trading or selling of an auto(s) to a sister dealership). Office staff didn't really mingle, wasn't very moral bound but they did offer good employee pricing on cars."
good,"Nice, clean shop good people to work with and interesting jobs. In the body industry each repair is unique, which made my job much more interesting than just service and repair."
good,"this company don't take care there employe.the work is ok but the manager are not good people, they think there are the best .Customer all ways complain about the cars detail is not good ."
good,"Great work environment, fast work flow, great benefits. Room for growth, promote from within. Management is great to work with, team effort work helps with job duties."
good,Meet new Customers every day and made lots of friends working at the Auto Industry very rewarding spiffs and get do demo the newest cars.
good,"Working at the dealership can have benefits.  However, you can also lose family life due to the amount hours waiting for the clients to arrive on the car lot or you may have an appointment."
good,Each day was different and a challenge.  A constant flow of customers.  Learned how to deal with happy and upset customers.
good,"Fair to good support at the corporate level. Less support in the store management. High turnover rate in store management with little department support. Must be willing to push aside personal and family needs for store needs. "
good,"- maintained customer satisfaction"
good,"Was responsible for ensuring that invoices matched the parts to be delivered each day, Parts Driver for Lithia and somedays Toyota as well. Also responsible for the pulling and loading of parts. This job required me to stay on time and on task every day to ensure timely and orderly parts delivery and invoice management."
good,I enjoy the people that I work with and they are dedicated to customer service.
good,not at all what they make themselves to be. to many young kids straight out of school with no knowledge or skills to do jobs properly. spend to much time with out pay trying to teach other people. would not mind if we were getting paid to do this but have family to support and they dont pay for teaching or showing how to do there job properly this being said i am flat rate/hourly. 
good,the work was easy and the people were friendly fun to talk to and work with and the hours wern't too bad. but if something came up and you needed different hours or to wanted to switch to a different position with in the company it was extremely difficult. and the head managers had no idea what went on in the back where the detailers worked.
good,"The job can be fun, but is hard during the winter having to stay outside most of the time. I've learned how important it is to maintain the good impressions that you make on people."
good,Willing to teach and a good possibility of advancement. Good work hours (set schedule) and pleasant environment. Good employee perks such as discount work on vehicle.
good,Worked in Sales but the location has closed since. Had some pretty good management that helped with the long hours. No salary just commission based. Work/Life balance is typical in the car sales world where there is n't much of one but it pays really well when you get your bonus and commission tiers.
good,"If you're competitive, have the salesman mindset, and are good with people, it may be a good fit for you. If not, don't waste your time; not very new person friendly."
good,I love the people there but the company seems to be double minded on what it wants. A lot of goals but no action to follow that through. They put the best social activities and Halloween is always fun! Needs to work on clear communication and follow-through.
good,"just a normal automotive dealership with the normal everyday "
good,"Good company to work with. Just hard to advance. Health insurance to expensive. Very fast past,( which I liked.) Down side up sales pushed to hard, lack of clear communication between management and workers."
good,I enjoy my job at Lithia motors. I have great bosses who are quick to give praise to their employees when they have done something worth praising. Although Lithia Motors does not pay employees what they deserve.
good,"Flexible hours, performance based. Great job for someone starting in customer care."
good,"I have been with the company for 4 years and am grateful for the opportunities I have been offered.  With that said, I find that with management changes, the atmosphere and environment are different, less like a ""family"" than before.  I sometimes feel that it is a hostile work environment, due to the language of other employee. but I believe the manager is addressing this issue. I enjoy the customer service part of the job and making a difference to our valued guests. Thank you."
good,"Lithia has done a lot of growing over the years and there are big discrepancies in wages between new employees and managers. Employee turn over was a major problem when I work there. However, there are lots of opportunity for career growth and if you are flexible you will be surprised at the ability to move around in the company."
good,"This is a good job offers insurance and some other good benefits. Got to what's what your doing and be quick at it and pay attention to all the details.  When I was there had a bad service manager, but there is a better one now"
good,I have enjoyed the training that Lithia has provided and the corporate side of it has be very educational. My co-workers and I work very well together. The job provides a very hard work/life balance but I always appreciate my customers.
good,Overall great place to work but with my experience and my pay wasn't worth it provided my own tools due to lack of tools to complete jobs on a timely manner. The management makes you feel like family good benefits and training over all. but recommend starting as technician opposed from lube tech.
good,I don't want to write a review of this company and I don't see how this in relevant to getting a job with a different company.
good,"Help with the Service Department phones. Help customers as they arrived at the service drive by getting their vehicle information and"
good,"Open the dealership, review the days schedule with the customer service employees, answered phones, scheduled training, performed computer updates, acted as a liaison for the customers and General Motors, hired, set pay and terminated employment of employees as needed, performed employee reviews and counseled employees on their strengths and weaknesses, called commercial customers on delinquent accounts, personally handle all customer's complaints and was the person called at night if a security alarm sounded. The hardest part was the restriction imposed by the company as to the actions that could be taken without approval of higher management."
good,I had a great time working at Lithia it was good had made good money I always wanted to go back but they won't resign me so I have to wait and see what happens next
good,I enjoy my coworkers and management we have a good time as well as get work done. You work under yourself and do not have anyone telling you what to do constantly. You keep up with yourself.
good,"While working here at Lithia I have been able to expand on my accounting skills, this is a very fast pace work environment, with lots of changes taking place regularly."
good,"A day at Lithia was usually very busy so everything was fast paced, so I learned how to work fast while pleasing the customer as well. My co-workers were awesome I still talk to most of them. The hardest part of the job was diesel trucks and the best part was my co-workers."
good,"This Job isnt for someone who likes to have a party life. You do and will work plenty of hours. The rewards are great though. Good pay and benefits usually out weigh how much you end up working. "
good,"A lot of should have and could haves, going on at this location.  Talk a good game, make it seem like they are willing to train the new talent, but only willing to do so to keep themselves certified.  Lot of yelling and cursing going on.  Felt like ""do as I say, not as I do"" workplace.  High turnover due to lack of sincere fairness.  The best part of the job is definitely the customers, the worst part of the job is management.  Need some training in the art of leadership.  Most of the coworkers are great, easy to get along with."
good,I sold cars.  Lithia has a great stance on no hassle sales.  the price on the window was what the customer paid.  they would do their best to get the car that meet the customers needs.
good,"LONG  LONG hours but lots of customer contact, pay was good,  Hardest part were the hours, The best part was the customer contact."
good,High turnover makes plenty of room for advancement. Exspected to work 250+ hours a month. Great sales training through sink or swim methods. Overall not a bad place to work for a fast learning over achiever
good,I worked based on flat rate pay so It was very stressful and very physical. However the harder you worked the more you got paid so it was worth it to me.
good,There is always something to do! Regardless of your position there are always many duties that can be accomplished. The culture of the workplace is varied and can often feel energized.
good,"Management was less than adequate upon hiring but was later resolved, but the benefits were too expensive to be able to afford copay's so i still couldn't afford health care. But the job in totality was just fine. Work stayed steady even through winter. Best part about the job was the nice staff."
good,Great product and can make money but poor management! Typical good ol boy store. If they like you you will suceed if they don't your out the door.
good,"its was a pretty lame place to work because of bad management, the manager finally got fired after I couldn't take it and resigned. must be a lot better there now.wasill"
good,"Love working on cars, new mamnagment take over laid everyone off."
good,"Pretty boring job especially since I work at night but its pretty laid back. Some of the sales guys are annoying to me (I'm female, they're all males) but overall they're cool guys. No real complaints about the job other than dealing with the occasional rude costumer."
good,Good company that has gone down hill on the training part of things.  Early in my career was taught quite a bit but and the second go around training has become very laxed. Good company long hours with ok pay.
good,"very poor managment, Negative on the home time, not family friendly, at ALL!!!"
good,"Intense deadlines to meet at a face pace environment-fun people to work with.  Typical Monday through Friday occasional Saturdays, at crunch times, work till later."
good,If you work for corporate work and home life is much better. If you work at the store level it is very stressful and competitive. I would recommend working at the corporate office if you would like to work at Lithia.
good,A huge variety of opportunities available. They encourage growth and provide mentorship and training. Supportive of working families. Offered flexible schedules.
good,"Its a great place to get into sales. I learned a lot about selling cars here. The management is helpful and vary upfront and they try their best to see you succeed. Some of the employees are distasteful due to their lack of patience and excessive temper and the lack keep ""tack""."
good,"Both relaxing and really fast pace at times, management could be either good to work for or terrible. Not too stressful you must be someone who is a hard worker"
good,This is a fast paced work environment. They provide great benefits. You will be working with a lot of people from sales and service department. Job advancement can depend on management.
good,"Full detail on used cars that go on preowned lot and i undercoated vehicles that were sold. I learned how to buff scratches, fully detail a vehicle, undercoat,move the lot for vehicles to fit in place. Managers were easy-going at times. Detail manager made everything easy to learn and helped out when needed. Hardest part of working here being short handed and you have a significant amount of work of your own and now you have to pick up someone else's slack. I enjoy the people i work around"
good,Competitive environment within a strong company. High turnover when results are not instantly provided. Leads managed via a BDC. Good environment for a sales person who is dedicated and focused.
good,Working at lithia it was that i experienced a lack in management structure due to their inability to provide myself with accurate instruction regarding my working title as well as indecisiveness in regards to my position as well as the inability to communicate clearly the duties of my employ at that location
good,One of the most important things in life is to do what you love and love what you do. Lithia makes that easy! You come to work and enjoy the fast paced environment of the car dealership life.
good,"Very healthy work environment, the staff is very friendly and polite. Does not offer much opportunity to move up in the system"
good,"great atmosphere learned a lot of useful skills and communication skills as well as got valuable information on buying and selling vehicles,"
good,"I loved my time at Lithia Chrysler Jeep Dodge of Missoula. Working with most of the people I had the pleasure of working with made the amount of time we all had together somewhat worth while.  The only difficulty for me was losing days off for sales events and as a result, losing time with my family.  The hours as a Business Manager were fairly difficult as well - having to stay until the deals were done meant that I was there until sometimes (particularly in the summer and during sales events) well after 10pm.  This might be OK for younger, single folks but for an older mother of two special needs kids, I needed to leave to put the focus on them. The amount of cash sales and sales to people out of state (selling over the phone) could affect #'s negatively and that was often difficult as well."
good,"I really loved working for lithia toyota,giving the chance I would work for them again,I just had to move away,for personal reasons"
good,This company used sales teams with closers that made things very compeditave and way to much undiserved stress.
good,Great people at the location. Poor compensation and no growth opportunities. Been at this location over 10 years and have been overlooked for promotion countless times.
good,Not a bad place to work. With recent manager and service writer change many technicians are wanting to leave. I have not received a pay increase in well over a year. ...
good,Chevrolet of Fairbanks was a great place to work at. If it wasn’t for the complications I had with personal/work relationships with my manager(my stepdad) I feel I would still be there
good,Very good company to work for. My advice to anyone interested in a position please follow rules and take job seriously! Don't make friends with management because it only causes issues down the road..
good,"Staff at Express Professionals is considerate and professional. Worked with my needs and represented me well. Have worked with them in multiple states, and had a positive experience each time."
good,"My typical day at Lithia Motors was investigating, evaluating, mediating and negotiating claim settlements for various stores.  Gathering enough information to make the most informative decision. I have learned that working as a team player with management is most effective in getting claims handled efficiently. "
good,"A great job for a driven person who always wants more in life, but you need thick skin. Any employee has endless potential and can create their own pay. really a great job."
good,I was selling cars and it just wasn't the job for me. So I looked elsewhere. But the people were great other than on manager who picked favorites. Culture was good.
good,A day at work is answering/ directing phone calls. Emailing messages that the service department is unable to answer. As well as helping customer walk-ins. Learned a lot of customer service and how dealerships run. The salesman and customers make work lively and more enjoyable. Management is very welcoming and kind.
good,"Close repair orders, submit warranty claims for payment to Toyota. Open used car repair orders and manage processes. I've learned over the years to be great at multi-tasking. I love all the people I work with, they are truly a great group of people. The hardest part of my job would be to make a dissatisfied customer happy again. The most enjoyable is the inter action with my co-workers."
good,"My company was recently bought out by Lithia Auto Group.  So, far the change has not been the issue.  I enjoy working here but I am looking to advance my career elsewhere.  I do not see a future in the way that this company has been run and the way that upper management has chosen to handle the Nissan store in particular."
good,Great people to work with. Flexible with hours in my position. My manager is amazing. Great Benefits. Moral is on the lower end of the spectrum and they are also doing all they can to bring that back up!
good,Able to make good friends both with co-workers and customers. Many were return customers and easy to assist with their needs. Many liked to talk a few minutes and gain any extra information on their vehicle.
good,Decent hours and fun to work here. It's fast paced but there are times that it was slow. It can get dull and repetitive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the sales team.
good,Critical to my professional growth.  All commission driven. High expectations and long hours. Large income potential. Management is intense and expects a lot.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, great benefits and work opportunities. The company has a great family feel with the way you treat customers as if you've known them forever."
good,"I learned alot working for lithia, and i have no complaints except the long work weeks and i feel like saleing cars just isnt my thing. my customer service skills have got better since iv worked there an learned alot about the car business but need to find what im good at."
good,"Used social networking, my personality and vast knowledge of business skills to get as many sales I could a month to be paid what I believed I was worth. A typical day would be securing new customers, creating new appointments for the following days, and focusing on closing EVERY sale that came in front of me. I learned a lot about utilizing the people and resources around me to gain my profits along with helping others in need too."
good,"Lithia is a great place to start your career and has lots of room for advancement. Six months after starting with the company, I received a promotion and I was allowed to use my skills to the fullest. If you like automobiles and a fast pasted environment, then you will do just fine within this company."
good,"Sales and leasing."
good,"A typical day of work for lithia motors. Get to work at 8:00 am go to a morning meeting at 8:30 stay there until 9:00 sometimes later. After that get on phones and try and set appointments for the day. Must have at least two appointments each day. After that we go to outside and try and catch ""ups"" . If we do catch one then we ""sell"" and meet our appointments at their given times. I learned how to sell from them. (the right way) the whole twelve step process created by Grant Cardone himself. My co workers were all great people. No one split a deal unless we had to, just because they all knew that we would do the same for them.  The hardest part of the job would be getting there at 8:00 in the morning and staying at work until 8:30 at night. Having a one hour lunch that in working 11 and a half hours a week for 6 days a week. Sunday is the only day off."
good,"Responsible for the sales of new (Ford) and used vehicles. Taking enquiries from the lot,telephone and Internet."
good,"Lithia Dodge was a good place to work but just the management was bad at the time, but it's a great shop to be in with great techs who get the job done."
good,"While working at Lithia Roseburg, I was comfortable with the management and other employees.  There was a general good attitude in the dealership and a good working relationship between all parts employees and the shop employees as well as the service employees.  The only downside was this is a large corporation and if there is a complaint by one employee about another employee to corporate, they will have no problem terminating the employee without allowing them to defend themselves or the management to defend them."
good,A typical day started with sales meetings to discuss the car sales from the day before and what could be done to increase sales the next day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people to find the right car for their needs.  The worst part about the job was the hours and the fact that the dealership was open 7 days a week.
good,"if you work hard and show drive, there is a great chance of moving up in the company. Withn in a year i moved up from assistant office manager to office manager and within six months was training to be a senior office manager travelling all over the US."
good,I worked in tech support and my coworkers and managers were awesome. The work itself wasn't difficult or stressful. There was little to no chance of advancement and the pay was awful
good,"This is an excellent company to learn advanced proven sales techniques.  They bring in experts for training classes, and have constant training modules.  You will become an expert on vehicle statistics, presentation, and closing sales.  Unfortunately, as is the case commonly with this line of work: the management can and most often is extremely abusive to their staff.  If you are not prepared to be screamed at and insulted and sworn at by your bosses: stay away."
good,"I worked for this company more than 12 years ago. I don't remember much about it, except that they continually compare their advisors, in a effort to drive sales and customer satisfaction."
good,Lithia Auto store has a good work environment but has a high turnover rate so your constantly having new managers and employees. Over all it is a good work place with decent benefits.
good,"As a receptionist I mainly answered phones but was able to gain some office experience and DMV related knowledge which was very nice. Anne, the general manager, is an awesome boss and made my experience working at the dealership a good one."
good,"Great people to work with, Management is awesome, really nice environment to work in. Sales wasn't my thing and you can't have much of a life outside it."
good,"Consistent work hours, nice management, nice co workers, company went out of business here in cedar rapids"
good,"same issues, different faces. Same as all other dealerships. poor leadership, misguided goals and lack of teamwork, but at the end of the day, if it ever comes, the techs will mis-diag, the wrong parts will be on back order, but that's okay because service  can't sell the job."
good,"Fast pace managing six dealerships from Parts, service to sales & Finance Dept. "
good,"While working at Lithia, was able to make a good leaving but they try to renogotiate contracts and you make less money for the same work. Great customer base and coworkers. Not alot of room for advancement."
good,"Great place to work, hectic and fun all in one!! Have to be extremely good at multi tasking in a small space. The facility is due for an update for sure! Everyone works together well as a team which is hard to find these days! Long hours and high stress positions lead to very intense times but it worth it when the job is complete and the customers are satisfied!"
good,"3 dealerships to work from Acura Audi and VW.  Every one is super friendly. Super competitive, never a dull moment. Management all around were awesome. However,  Horrible hours, straight commission, have to work weekends and holidays."
good,"Arrived at 7 AM and met with other managers to gain information about recent sales or service.  Conducted an interactive meeting with my staff to discuss possible or actual customer complaints.  I answered questions and provided guidance on how to answer/solve the customer's complaints or questions.  I learned to listen to people's concerns, work among various departments to come to a reasonable solution to benefit the customer and my employer.  I had the unique opportunity to be the first manager of their business development program.  My staff was comprised of young college students.  That provided me with the experience to coach and mentor my staff.  My staff was willing to learn and I was willing to listen.  The most difficult part of the job was encountering other managers who were unwilling to take on new ideas or improvements to our business model based on customer suggestions.  I quickly overcame that obstacle.  The best part of the job was seeing my staff learn, get better at their job and get promotions."
good,Poor management. Just a normal office environment overall. Co workers are great. Most people are positive. No room for growth.
good,enjoyed being busy and fast pace and dealing with customers
good,"A typical day at work is detailing as many vehicles as possible as best as possible because this job pays flat rate not hourly. I learned how to clean vehicles thoroughly inside and out, how to perform undercoating, how to work under pressure and how to work in a fast paced environment. Management was good they would check on us throughout the day but give us our space so we could focus on our job. Workplace culture was good, its all about having respect for your coworkers and your work and the customers and making sure that your work is perfect for the customer. The hardest part of the job was having to clean very dirty vehicles in an 8 hour workday that our do at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of this jobs was being able to work alone and focus on your own work and learning new things from your coworkers."
good,"One of Lithia Motors core values is ""Growth Powered by People"", which they define as a work environment that promotes employee career advancement. I witnessed this first-hand, I was hired as a receptionist/office administrator and within 3 years was promoted to Business Manager. I would not have accomplished this without the help of my managers who saw my potential and encouraged me to take advantage of the training opportunities and resources offered by the company. I had never worked for a company that took such care and pride in their values."
good,"The Parts and Service departments have a very good group of folks. The Service Manager was supportive and had my back on more than one occasion. A very fun environment."
good,I worked flat rate so it was up to me to be efficient with my time and make the most out of it. But if you cant keep up with the work then you will fall behind.
good,"Love working here! "
good,I was happy to work there. I changed a lot of oil and stayed busy. I enjoyed helping out and learning new things. I did a lot of cleaning there as well.
good,Lithia values work life balance. You will work very hard  and push you to achieve daily goals. Everyone that works at Lithia is very friendly and helpful.
good,This company prides itself on providing the Premium Experience. The employees all know one another and are courteous. Management is approachable and often available to meet with. Clients know and can sense the employees work here because they enjoy it here.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lithia, but knew that it was time to change career paths. My manger was definitely a micro-manager so it made it difficult for me to be successful when asked to do tasks."
good,Easy to communicate to others employees respect me as human being. Managers listen to my suggestion what is best for the company. Nice place to clean cars.
good,This job can be a very good business if you know who you can sell.  It is very fast paced and you have to be quick on your toes and especially on how to respond to your customers. Managers are great and are easy to work with.
good,I had a great time here working at Lithia Dodge in Corpus Christi Texas I always had work to do always have the best cars to do Chrysler Dodge vans Dodge trucks always help other people out to help mechanic people I helped get parts for otheralways help other people out to help mechanic people I help get parts for other people pretty much I helped a lot of my friends do the vehicles clean the whole job during the day go to lunch come back take all the trash cans out from the shop if I didn't have nothing to do I find something to do I cleaned the property making a good overall ratings I would say that it's a five-star at the end of my shift at 6 I will close all my side the doors make sure everything was locked make sure all the vehicles were clean so the customers will be happy I had a great time and a great environment to work at Lithia Dodge I prove myself that I can be the best detailer for the San Antonio locations
good,This job has a great instructive environment and it is probably one of the best jobs I will have ever held. As long as you can properly shuffle the politics and your business deals you will excel at this job.
good,I only wish they had more stuff like google or yahoo in the building but all in all work atmosphere is cool.........................................
good,"I enjoyed working there, the hours were fantastic and i loved the environment. My boss was very understanding and I appreciated his patience."
good,"Many dealership experiences will be different depending on how management likes to run things, but as a company, Lithia offers many great health and vacation benefits and as long as you work well with your coworkers and show management you are serious about your work then your job and any advancements are essentially guaranteed."
good,They cross train in different areas.  The management is very understanding with personal life.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the different departments
good,My day consists of overseeing and maintaining the fast paced environment necessary to get cars detailed and out in a timely manner.
good,"Great place to work.i really loved my job,co-workers were great,i'd have to say the hardest part of my job was keeping up a steady pace at diagnostics and maintaining accuracy on time because sometimes you can get overwhelmed with multiple vehicles"
good,This is a good place to work if you can deal with fast pace and have knowledge of the vehicle industry. Management was always helpful to me in the best ways they could and always listened to any concerns I might have had. They listen to new ideas that I had to help with overall customer service.
good,the day started at 7:30 move car frome the main entrance to the back parking lot around 830 ill start with the courtesy driving part of the job for the rest of the day.
good,"It can be incredibly challenging and stressful, but the wins make it so worth it. I absolutely love being in a position of helping people. People come in with broken vehicles and we get to save the day."
good,I loved that any training I asked for I got. I did't need to lie to a customer for a sale. I learned to increase profits cut cost and keep my employees happy.
good,I like working for Lithia! It's a great place to work. I like everyone I work with. It's cahllenging at times and I get good advice on how I could possible advance within the company.
good,I liked working there. Fast paced. I love working on vehicles so this was a very good job for me. Always had a job to do never had to worrie about not having a job.
good,Great place to work for just hours that they had is working or I couldn’t  have family time with my kids And they wouldn’t move me up when I was ready to a different sales position
good,"Great hours, great benefits, easy going people. Very fast paced days to where you wouldnt notice the time. Company has few locations this side of the mississippi and none on the other side so if planning to move no transfers"
good,"Each day is filled with exciting new opportunities and challenges.  Each challenge is met with a very supportive and collaborative team effort.  The culture here is very positive with a ""Can Do"" mentality."
good,"The typical work day as a parts delivery driver was simple, receive, deliver, complete other tasks.  There was never a hard day or an easy day, it was pretty much always the same.  The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"Do not try to make a career working here, it takes a certain kind of person that only has money on their mind. If you like to have good coworker relationships don't expect to make them very quickly."
good,This store will help you grow into the next position.  You make an effort to product and Lithia Toyota will help you move up through out the company.  The people at Lithia Toyota are great to work with as well.
good,Working with the people I did made the job that much better.  It was a close knit group that were like minded.   You hear horror stories about dealership but not at Lithia CJD.
good,Wait on customers and try to help them choose the right vehicle for them and their family. I learned to deal with people. I worked will with co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the waiting for the next customer. The most enjoyable part was seeing people satisfied.
good,"This job was very demanding due to the fact that the Anchorage, Alaska market has not had the Mini brand around for a significant period of time. It was a ""grass roots"" opportunity. The market share has the demand for a vehicle that is priced up to $50,000 and is conservative with fuel. The Mini brand offers an ""ALL4"" (Mini's version of the all wheel drive) system that actually rivals the Subaru's all wheel drive system. "
good,You can make excellent money if you are a motivated individual.
good,"working in the car business is not easy but when you know what you want, you can get the best of it."
good,Over all customer service is great communication and team work if okay. Very friendly family invironment as well would surely reccomend this place to a friend
good,"Great place to work.  The hours can be long and job can get stressful.  There is a constant need to perform and the paperwork can be somewhat daunting.  Not for the faintest of heart.  Fun sales team made the days more enjoyable, when not super busy with customers or paperwork."
good,"Good place to work, and management is exceptional. A lot of learning and new experiences when working for a dealership."
good,Its been a good experience working here i have learned a lot of new things that will benefit me in the future. I have definitely learned how to work under pressure. Also dealt with a lot of paper work.
good,Lithia is a good place to work--- I would recommend it to anyone looking for a corporate car job. They don't hire super stars
good,"This is a fun place to work, however, they are well known for underpaying their employees.  For the area the pay is okay, but if you look in other areas, they are a little lower than most.  They are great with flexible schedules and will help pay for your education if your degree makes sense and is related to the field (i.e. they won't pay for you to get a teaching degree or an unrelated field).  They focus on work-life balance, which is nice, if you can't find a baby sitter, they don't bat an eye on posting your kids up in the quiet rooms.  They host a yearly event on Mount Ashland for you and your family members to go skiing all expense included and its catered.  There is frequently catered food left for the employees after meetings are over, they open this up to the building.  They do encourage development and this is huge considering they are such a large corporation.  They are supportive of you following your dreams, even if that means your career has shifted you to working somewhere else."
good,"This a very fast paced work environment, with the expectation to be efficient and cater to complete customer service at all times. Very highly motivated problem solvers do very well here."
good,"nice people to work with not enough work to go around"
good,Great place to work and enjoy working for lithia. Management is well connected and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is trying to meet time hacks. Most enjoyable parts of my job is working doing the thing I love to do.
good,"Willing to work with school schedules. Some hangups with technology, meaning that some of the technology in the workplace was outdated. The management at the store always has a sense of urgency and attention to detail. The hardest part of the job can be the hours. 7:30 until 6:00 Monday through Friday can be a tough schedule."
good,"Detail oriented management, honest hard working co-workers, and a rewarding career atmosphere."
good,"A typical day for Lithia Motors Is ALWAYS on the go. Starting from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. there is non stop customer service interaction. I can honestly say I've leaned from this job to be MORE of a multi tasker and independent. Management team and co-workers are great at Lithia Motors. They are very hard working and self motivated. Hardest part about working at Lithia are the long hours. It can be hard to be away from your family. Though you work for those long period of hours, the rewards are great, both career wise and financially."
good,Extremely high speed environment but had great support from incredible co-workers.  Learned an entire new software program from ADP for auto repair shops.  The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting a type of clientele I had not yet worked with before and learned many new and exciting things from them.  The hardest part of my job was that is was 6 days a week and an average of 65 hours per week.
good,"Great company as long as GM is great. "
good,Lithia is a place where you can and will climb if you choose too. You will get what you put in it. Pay scale is lacking but they provide lots of training and room for advancement!
good,Lithia is great place to work. competitive pay plan probably best in the business. down side is probably the hours worked but it pays well and benefits are great.
good,Certainly a great company and organization. The GM was the only person I worked with/for that basically verbally wrote me up for being “too positive”.
good,I have a love for cars. Working here meant being around so many all the time. I got to see the brand new ones come off the truck and at times someone might trade in a classic you'll get to wax and place on the lot in a spot of your choice.
good,"Most days were pretty routine, helping customers and organizing parts. But it taught me a lot about customer service and time management. It made it a lot easier because my coworkers were very kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was during the summer when it got hot. It was difficult to sit in the attic and go through and organize parts. The best part about it was my coworkers being so helpful and easy to get along with."
good,A typical day at work is calling sold customers and asking them about their purchase. Doing a lot walk. Greeting customers as they come onto the lot.  I have learned how to use the LSMS computer system to enter data into the computer.  The management team is wonderful and my co-workers are great.  The hardest part of my day is waiting for customers to come on the lot after I make all of my phone calls.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers make a selection and watch how happy they are after they come out of financing.
good,Great place to work for had a great job there. people there were great customers were great
good,Hyudai was a great place to work they will teach you how to sell sell sell
good,"Everyday was fresh start. I was one of the top 3 tech at the Quick lane. Amazing work place, I had fun everyday. I still have a lot of memory form Lithia Ford. Made many amazing friends, who were alway willing help anyone."
good,"I love working here! A great place to work with a fun and supportive culture. Ample opportunities to grow and learn. Excellent benefits, 401K, Medical, Dental, Vision."
good,I can't imagine any other dealership being a better place to work. The cars sold themselves. Amazing deals were made. Customers came back after decades just to work with the company. Lots of leads offered. Compensation was fantastic. Sales goals were realistic. Management was fantastic.
good,Lithia is a great company to work for. Ive made more money here in sales than any of my previous sales employers. Management is fair and level headed on professional decisions to be made.
good,"goal oriented work environment, with good people. Fast paced team based body shop. you are left only to do your job, as long as you are able to do it."
good,"As a director of marketing for 28 dealerships in 12 states I truly loved the work and all of the people that I met. The travel, however, became unmanageable at times."
good,"Exceptional environment to learn, grow and advance.  Lithia is a top notch employer that values their employees. The training is on going and second to none."
good,Lithia Ford of Boise has a very professional workplace environment. Any auto sales representative would be blessed to work at such a great dealership.
good,Very welcoming culture ability to make income based on willingness to learn and drive training fast paced equal opportunity employer promotions from within
good,"The overall job itself is good and there is no limit to the money you can make, its fun but you really have to be self motivated to make good money here. My only complaint is that management is blind to their faults and even to some employees faults unless you request it one on one training is hard to get."
good,"I started at Lithia immediately after getting my Associates degree. I will admit I didn't make much at first. But over the 5 years I was there I learned a lot, took on new tasks, worked overtime when asked or necessary and feel I was accomplished at this company. I liked the people I worked with and there are people I didn't like as well just like any other job. The managers were good to me and I received raises over the years when I could prove I deserved them. I really had no desire to go through any of their management programs but they were available to those who wanted to. I only left the company in 2008 because there was a lot of downsizing and instead of fearing I would lose my job I just went and found another one."
good,"From day one, my experience at Lithia was more than I'd ever expected. The environment and company culture was a perfect match for me and for my family. I learned several job skills that still benefit me and my current organization (military). "
good,The parts department is an easy and very positive workplace to be at there pretty of work option there for you to do and many great benefits and pay can be good if you can get a contact
good,"DCH Kay Honda is a fantastic place to work. Management treats you with respect and you are compensated for the work you perform."
good,"The store I work for is very tightly knit, and everyone supports each other. It's still sales, so it's competitive. However, the general sales manager is driven to make you money, but within a responsible margin."
good,Fast paced great fun staff. Creative management engagement at all times. The day goes by fast great pay and always get to meet fun customers. Long hours you have to be ok with that.
good,"Worked there for 7 months and it was the best job I ever had, the people were awesome, always willing to talk and help me if I needed it, bosses were great! It was just an awesome place to work. Just had to leave for family issues"
good,"The job was pretty good, we would put gas in cars new or old and get them ready for customers when they were being sold weather thats 1 vehicles or 10 being sold at the same time which meant we would have to work on one right after another if necessary. We didn't necessarily have any breaks  but most of the time it wasn't to fast paced unless maybe it was a Satuarday."
good,"The people I worked with were exceptional.  If there were any questions I had they were more than willing to provide the answers.  I learned so much working there."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for Lithia Chevrolet of South Anchorage. I have learned a lot, and am very grateful for the guidance and opportunity provided to me there. A typical day at work is generally very fast-paced and high intensity. It could involve anything from assisting customer, accounting work, or human resources/payroll support. "
good,"I have really enjoyed my job and time here at the dealership, I love the people I work with and I have mastered my job. I have learned the in's and out's of the title department and have mastered dealing with the state and county's of Montana. I have also learn a lot about other states rules and regulations.
