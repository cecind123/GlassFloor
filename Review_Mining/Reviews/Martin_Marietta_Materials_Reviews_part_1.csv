bad,Job was great could see myself retiring from there foreman great guy there only down side is the management and employee’s that didn’t want to work would take asking them to do there job as BULLYING  you can lie about other employee’s and get them fired poor communication from there management out in Denver. Low employee morale
bad,"Supervisors are a joke,dont abide by the rules,they make you do what they want not the way its supposed to be done. Not a great place for employment,dont have employees back"
bad,This company does not care about the safety of their employees. If you report an injury you are then bullied. Overall I would not recommend a job with this company to anyone.
bad,Just had a bad experience and wasnt a good fit for me. I didnt do the best of work due to stress and inexperience but overall it is what you make of it.
bad,"There is a reason they are ALWAYS hiring because people are quitting faster then they can train them.  The worst management I have ever dealt with.  Good luck trying to get a manager to listen to you and if they were to listen they just blow off your concern.  If something were to happen, you will be blamed for it.  They preach safety as a number one concern, but it better not cost them any money.  If you were to get hurt, they will fire you so they can keep their accident free record.  Saturdays, plan on working 10-12 hours while the management is out skiing and golfing. "
bad,The job field I worked in at Martin Marietta is now gone. So it is impossible to judge it now. Martin Marietta sold off that entire section of the company to another company.
bad,"This company does not give bonuses. even though they are a billion dollar a year company they make the drivers clean the breakroom, restrooms, and toilets."
bad,Workplace is not innovative and I learned no new skills. I worked in the corporate office and it's a very old population in terms of age and mind set.
bad,This is a good place to work. You work long hours and are paid well. I would let a member of my family or a friend work there. The benefits are good as well.
bad,"Good pay,but very rascist. Horrible management, lazy workers,saftey is a joke at this job,they preach it over and over but when it comes down to it they dont care about saftey, they care about money.The lazy workers that show up when they want get treated like kings,and they guys that bust there butt get nothing."
bad,"I was told by the management that my truck had leaked out coolant, but it never did. I asked to see the pictures of the leak, they said corporate had them."
bad,"Get used to being lied to on a regular basis. What do they lie to you about? How much they’re going to pay you, where you’ll be at, and what you’ll be doing. If you have difficulty dealing with being lied to, don’t come here. "
bad,"Top dispatch guy quit.want treated fairly.denied advancement.Low hours,bad environment.Management looks out for own.H.R personnel no help.Never answers phone.Problems never get adressed"
bad,Inexperienced Bosses.Management tells lies.No Advancement ( unless you are a Buddy) Saftey( Cap Meetings) Only is important when they feel it is necessary.Training isn't long enough for Equipment.Management should be in Plant seeing work being done/what needs to be addressed clean-up and Saftey.
bad,Martin Marietta is a ok company working here there is no time to spend with your family long shifts non choice of overtime not much vacation time given and once you request management usually denys it. Lots of other issues
bad,Been at the company for years and the place is a joke. This company says they Support family but condemn the family man. Say they care about safety and health when it's convenient to the company. Oh and for advancement gotta run around with upper management. Now they have a crew of management that has no idea how to run the plant.  It's no honor to work for. If you have family look elsewhere unless friends with management.
bad,"They talk safety, ethics, and morals. But in all reality this company only worries about stock for its investors. When I started I was told the normal week was 4/10 hour days. That's a lie, you need to plan on 10+ hours 6 days a week. I worked 14 hour days numerous times. Worked Sundays also. Also there are no breaks. Not even lunch. Safety takes a side seat to production. Advancement opportunities are basically non existent. And the pay is mediocre at best. There is no balance of work/personal life."
bad,"If your not a total suck up to the boss you will get the worst loads, the worst hours, the worst contractors, and the worst trucks. It would be better to work at Mc Donald's. this place sucks!."
bad,"It was not a good place to work. The company could not keep the trucks that we used running and together. The trucks keeped always braking down. The people that ran dispatch, was always in a hurry, no matter what happened.   I've been doing this kind of work for ten yrs, an I have never been trieded  like this, other than working for R.W.Sidley."
bad,You will work 60 hours plus . Very hard to balance home life with Martin . The management is very shady also . Would recommend them if you have no family .
bad,They say their a safe company but thats just a smoke screen. When i went to a supervisor to address some safety issues his response was to hide behind some company policy. When they tell you they don't allow any thing or anybody to act or be unsafe its just smoke and mirrors.
bad,"I really don't understand the point of the Cleburne plant, there is never any work for Cleburne.  They send us to other plants the majority of the time. Work long hours one day then nothing the next. Always tired for no reason,  definitely not making any money in Cleburne.  If you can live off of 40 hours a week, you'll love it at the Cleburne plant.  If not, RUN! ZERO STABILITY!"
bad,They difficult now. The new plant manager is hard to deal with. Other than that there big on safety and and employee's there are the best crew. I worked there for 6 years.
bad,"Worked in a dump truck with little to no air conditioning with a heat index above 100 degrees.  Manager was not concerned and never gave relief during the high heat.  They stress safety, but never implement safety."
bad,"Good job ...  If you don't care about safety or integrity ."
bad,"Really it’s the issue of management, and the work life balance. Great benefits and pay but uneven work schedule and some are treated better than others."
bad,Job is not secure. Laid off several months out of the year. Too difficult financially to make a living. This job does not promote fairly from within and does not help their workers advance to a higher level even though they do the work.
bad,They had too many people telling you what to do. I was not trained in some areas and they expected me to know. Really bad communication. And no question is a dumb question is worng when it comes to this company!
bad,Iv learned a lot working for martin Marietta this is a good company to work for. The people are great they teach you what you need to know they go above and beyond.
bad,A difficult work environment with unhappy employees. Pay is low and moral is very poor. Employees are looking for way our and talk poorly about about management.
bad,"Their CEO go's on in the hand book about doing what's right and their strong reputation for honesty. Yet they lie to the drivers about the mixer trucks drive camera's. Telling the drivers the camera's only go off on a hard stop or  motion. Actually when a driver at a plant hit something and caused damage, the company was able to get footage from a parked trucks camera at the plant to find the culprit. So remember big brother can see and hear you all the time. You have no privacy. Yet at the Dallas head offices they are behind a wall of frosted glass ( literally)  you have to put in a code from a book for who you want to see and they can see you on a camera and have to let you in. You can not see in at all. What are they afraid of ? could it be the long time employees that they get rid of when there body's wear out and can no longer do their jobs. Yes drivers that have worked hard for them for years in cold and hot weather, six days a week. Then because there hand aches from arthritis and they can't lift a fifty pound bucket at a concentra test martin Marietta lets you go just before your social security becomes fully mature. Also the company takes on large jobs from long time customers promising some many yards/trucks per hour knowing they can not fulfill this promise and dispatch will tell drivers to lie to the customer and tell them you had a flat tire or issue with your truck.  Also dispatch plays favorites with mixer drivers and if you dare to say anything or question them, you will get the worst jobs. Favoritism runs rampant at Martin Marietta  especially with family members."
bad,"Great people to work with, but the plant foreman is well educated but has never preformed the work. We broke down everyday due to his lack of knowledge."
bad,"If you are the type to put yourself out there and go above and beyond skip martin.  The ""good ol boy network"" is king here.  Expect to do your job and and at least half of someone else's if you are an operator.   Its better as a driver because its impossible to get fired.  Hit a car? Drug test and get back to work.  Hit a truck with the loader? Drug test and get back to work.   Hit two trucks in a month and get a three day vacation.   Just don't get hurt.  Slip on the ice in front of the office?   No one will ever see you again.  Hurt your back because of a defective truck seat?  Adios.  It's how they keep their perfect safety record.   Deny the claim and hope you don't sue.  "
bad,"While employed here i went through many different instances that no one should have to experience in their working career. Management was poor, I never felt comfortable coming to work"
bad,Had a great opportunity to grow.  Put in the hours necessary but my direct boss was unfit to lead.  Had unreasonable expectations and was driving everyone crazy.  Glad I left.
bad,job that requires a lot of your personal time. Working 6 to 7 days a week year around. No family time or home life what so ever. When they hire people they look for warm body's rather then qualified personal.
bad,"The only positive thing I have to say about Martin Marietta is that they have good medical benefits for a reasonable price. The rest of their qualities are poor at best. Examples: I know half a dozen people (aside from myself) that have been in the same position for ten years or more with aspirations for career advancement that are stuck because this company has an unwritten rule requiring a 4 year degree to go anywhere.  The only exceptions are the people that were good at stabbing others in the back to move up, and the occasional promotion to get quell a situation that would result in a lawsuit.  If you have aspirations for a career, find a better place. Its not hard."
bad,The lead man and production manager showed extreme favoritism towards the lead mans (step)son. And now the lead man is leaving going to another plant they are passing the position down to to his son even though there are others way more qualified to do the job. Since I’ve been working I haven’t had over 60 hours while everyone else pulls in at least 65-60 hours a week.
bad,"Great people to work with but the management is only carres about production. 70 plus hours a week during the busy, they say there's a balance of home and work but they lied. Benefits are not bad but could be better. If your single or like to live at work then this is a great job for you."
bad,"No advancement unless you have an engineering degree."
bad,"From the outside looking in, MMM appears to be a fantastic company to work for. They offer great benefits, 401k AND pension, and pay pretty decent. But they fail to mention that they will work their salary employees entirely too many hours for their salary rate, don't offer OT or other compensation for salary employees, and place extremely high demands on them that are almost unachievable in a 40 hour week. Also, the hourly employees have far too much authority over their supervisors, even having the ability to get them fired without warning. The hourly guys tend to use the overly critical safety culture as a crutch to avoid finishing their work in a timely manner or even at all, and are notorious for using the same safety culture to play politics with the upper management team. It's a dangerous formula they've instilled and it will come back to bite them in the future."
bad,"This company is a good place in some districts, but not the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The upper management is very shady and very weak.   Very poor leaders who are fake and have no backbone. I would never recommend working for this company in this area."
bad,its a job that will pay bills half way. management isnt all that great. not very up to date with maintenance equipment. lots of communication problems
bad,"All in all I'm sure it's a great company to work for, my experience was not so well due to poor management at the facility I worked at."
bad,Great place to work if you are desperate for income.  I don't think it a place most will see a long term career. When the economy is good everyone should stay employed.
bad,Trust NO ONE and watch your back the place is crawling with backstabbers that suck up to management union brotherhood does not exist at this place....
bad,The most racist company that I've encountered and worked for in my 48yrs on this earth there are different standards and rules for AA and management perpetuates that culture no room for growth I was always told when I stated that I wanted to learn every aspect of the plant they have me every excuse to why I couldn't learn it or once you're a pit loader you're stuck in that position
bad,Very good company but as far as management  its a joke if you kiss they butts you can get away with murder but if stand up for what u believe they tend to try n get rid of u in a heart beat
bad,"Could be a very promising place to work with the proper staffing, maintenance and training for new employees. There are many inexperienced newly hired employees, with no prior experience,  training newly hired employees with no prior background. This is making a high risk job even more dangerous. There were also only 2 or 3 maintenance staff to perform routine and regular repair and services. All routine maintenance that couldn't be preformed was done by the same inexperienced workers throughout their shift or just neglected to be done."
bad,"The check clears in the winter you will make no money you will travel to all of the plants in denver metro if you call in you will get written up unsafe trucks no breaks they take hours away from your check for no reason they make up a story that the system did it"
bad,A typical work day was never expected. Reason for that is there was poor management when things broke down and could not be repaired that just pushed it to the side. The hardest part of the job was that I had to try to fix things that could not be fixed also getting yelled at by management for doing what they asked.
bad,"Pay is ok, but you’re just a truck number. Very little room for advancement as good drivers are in short supply. I did not feel valued as an employee."
bad,a lot of the workers their are very prissy about how everything looks and that their is no mishap anywhere or you will be notified. they are very particular about the cleanness of the facility
bad,12hr work days 6 or 7 days a week. Have lots of safety rules that must be followed. Management is easy to get along with  Will provide lots of training for employees
good,"A lot of bias and preferential treatment"
good,"No respect or appreciation, no matter how hard you work. All management cares about is how much money they can save rather than their own employees. Good luck getting any time off with your family during the summer because it won't happen."
good,I liked the job and everyone at the yards I worked. Worked for several yards just so I could get some hours. Fired for concrete drying up due to driving an hour and half to jobsite and the workers were not ready to pour so they ran my truck outta of water before pouring 3 hours later.I even have proof they knew it was happening but I was to stay at the jobsite.
good,"All they want you to do is work more and and never give any real money for it. They have there favorites and HR is god there. Management will tell you one thing and do a complete other. The hours that you are required to work are crazy but that is just ready mix. Good benefits and a guaranteed 40 hr pay. But you can not live off of it, You literally live off O.T. and B.S."
good,"Mandatory 6 day work week. Plenty of overtime. Good hourly pay. Friendly co-workers, decent work place. No respect or appreciation for long hours worked or job well done from members of management."
good,good pay but childish and poor management. hours are very inconsistent and constantly being lied to. this company has a lot to improve on but doesn't seem to care as long as they are making more money and paying the employees as least as possible
good,Martin Marietta provides a stressful work environment if your goal is to perform 100% as other employees are there just to get by and management is poor.
good,typically work 5- 10hr days and 9 hrs on saturday every week. only time off is vacation or some holidays. no advancement in your personal career. no home time
good,"A typical day, for me, an underground truck driver was driving in a circle underground in a mine for 11 hours.  Some days went smooth others not so smooth.  I learned a lot about the mining industry as far as what to look for to maintain a safe work environment for my fellow employees.  The management side of it I think could use a little more work.  If you needed something (small examples; radio or a mine light), you would get a radio but more than likely it wouldn't work or it would work but the battery wouldn't last that long.  Mine lights were the same way and would take forever to receive one.  The hardest part of my job was staying awake.  It's very easy to get tired so you have to find ways to keep you awake.  The most enjoyable part of my job was having others there keeping me safe and making it a fun place to work."
good,"Typical Mining operation and maintenance of Primary Crushing Operation, jaw crusher standard crushers, screens, conveyors, operate equipment. No room for advancement."
good,Local managment is good but upper echelon managers only seem to care about production and profit.  Plenty of hours if you want overtime.  The equipment you operate is typically kept in good condition.
good,ok if your a full time employee work in the scale house in Rosenberg Texas I was doing both jobs until I got laid of because of something with staffing
good,"I loved the job itself however the management team lacks. Issues/needs for employees take way too long to be addressed. Information does not always get passed along the proper channels to those who need it. They do not value their employees as much as the dollar, nor do they uphold their policies in a consistant manner. Too much favortism."
good,Good company with service to DOD for Titan rockets and classified technology
good,Great place to work out of high school better place to go to work if your skill set is right you will learn a lot from the older guys but as soon as you get the chance find something better because it is a dead end job
good,"Worked for Enviromental Manager making sure files were updated, typing completed for correspondence as well as submitting applications for excavation permits.  Also ordered necessary supplies for rock quarries."
good,"Enjoy working at Martin marietta, I'm jus not satisfied with my wages. Overall it is a great productive place to work. Safety is mandatory at this place of business"
good,was able to meet interesting people and help to provide information for the members of the union as well as learn.  Was able to make advancement by educating myself.
good,"Co workers are great and environment is great"
good,Great job security but you have no family life. Great pay and benifits. Management is tough but is very strict on safety.
good,"I completely understand watching expenses and costs.  When a place has been let go for so long without any real reinvestment and the men DO NOT have the proper tools, equipment as well as the man power it is extremely difficult to achieve desired results.  The men stay frustrated with low moral due to the demands.  Very good if not the best overall workforce I had the pleasure to work with."
good,Nice work enviroment with professionals that love the work they do. Co-workers and management give you all the necessary tools needed to learn anything you want to know about your job.
good,"I was responsible for testing, evaluating and verifying operation of electronic, electromechanical and electro-optical systems. I also analyzed failures and malfunctions restoring them to engineering specifications. Set up and operated test equipment to obtain complete and accurate test data."
good,Safety is key and is highly recognized as being one of the Safest companies in the United States to work for. One of the values instilled in us is Safety and Family.
good,"The employees have more experience than upper management.  They will fire people to use as examples, and talk down to you till you get fed up and quit"
good,"Honestly, it’s a great company. They start you off higher than the competition and there are opportunities for a quarterly bonus and even a yearly production bonus. It all really depends on which quarry you work at on wether you’ll enjoy your job. I’m just a groundman, but backup for many positions. They can’t add a raise because their paper doesn’t allow it! Management is hit or miss. Work/Life balance is terrible, they change the schedule at the drop of a hat and even more when you work the night shift at least in the district I work in. When I started working there, I was amazed at how well they treated us but that culture is leaving and turning all corporate and they’re worried about numbers to the point that the safety culture is leaving. We aren’t just a number, prioritize safety and quality people in management. I really hope somebody from HR reads this."
good,It’s was a good place to be trained. They take a lot of time to train you and make sure you know what your doing and also doing it in a safe manner. But one you do get trained and you are good at what you doing moving up is almost impossible to move up they want you where you are.
good,"working at Martin Marietta can be grueling,  it's a dirty job but they pay well and offer benefits.  Management is scarce so you need to self motivated and willing to expand your knowledge and experiences because the company is big with many workers so it's easy to get lost in the shuffle of the company. the work hours are long sometimes 6 days a week but the employees are great and it can be fun."
good,I enjoyed my time at Martin Marietta Materials. Made great money had every type of certificate or schooling I could get. I worked very hard and usually 10 to 12 hours a day 6 days a week. They brought in new management and he got rid of all of us that had 10 years or more service. After about a year they realized he had messed up and they called everyone to come back but I didn’t go because I was already working another job and was upset that I had dedicated most of my life and them treat me like that so I didn’t go back.
good,It was an honor to work with amazing coworkers. Their policies are ground breaking on safety awareness and implementation. But management is only interested in their career and not the hard working employees.
good,"long hrs low pay family time limited"
good,"Great work environment, but they really overload their employees. Management do not give expectations, will not keep you up to speed with operations and daily activities. They literally dump everything on Office Managers. A distinct disconnect right there. There is no consistency and a great deal of miscommunication. I believe if they restructure upper management, streamline procedures, and keep office managers in the loop on all operations, then the culture will be less stressful. I enjoyed working with all of the departments. There is no micromanagement, which makes making decisions easier. Martin takes pride in their safety program and they uphold it, which is fantastic. Again, financially they operate very well."
good,If you enjoy lots of long hours this is the place for you.  The biggest pro of working here is that safety is always #1. Some locations have the work hours under control and are great.  Other just want to work employees to death and wonder why there is constant turnover.
good,"They are not consistent with rules they bend them for occasional reason . Employees don’t have say or get recognition when needed ."
good,"Aggregates is a good place to work. good benefits and a good 401 k plan. its a lot of things you have to learn in a timely matter. But if you are serious about your job you will learn them. I had no experience at all when I started, within a year in a half I was impressed with all the things I've learned. it's a good environment and like all jobs can be stressful at times. But at the end of the day they take care of u so u can provide for your family."
good,I regretfully pass on commenting on this here. i do not think a review like this would help future potential candidates. the one benefit I did like was this company has a retirement plan including the traditional 401k.
good,good people to work with on the production level. hard to trust upper management. tend to treat the lower level workers as just a number.  no bonus program for hourly employees but upper management has a bonus program
good,"Its not that bad of a job can get kind of boring, but I think thats because i cam from the offshore drilling and we are working none stop. Here we tend to have a lot of down time and have to work long hours to make any type of good money since the hourly rates aren't that high."
good,Good company to work for until they merged with Lockheed.  Just not the same.  
good,"working for this company you have to be able to do repetitive tasks for 12 hr a day all day everyday. i learned safety is key in this work place, working with heavy equipment everyday."
good,"Original posting states it's for heavy equipment operator but you'll spend more time fixing equipment that should be replaced, then getting yelled at for taking too long to attempt to patch something together you've tried to fix three times before. The night shift crew is too small and pushed beyond it's limits and everyone is constantly on edge and ready to fight due to work load and too many hours."
good,"This is a job for any CDL driver who likes to be home every night and still make decent pay. A lot of overtime, and most Saturdays off. No labor. Very simple job"
good,"Pros"
good,Great job until lay off's happened. Good hours and good managment. I enjoyed the work. Great benefits and competetive pay. I Wish it could have lasted
good,Compensation and benefits are good. Job was a blend of indoors and outdoor activity. All of my management experience I gained while employed by the company.
good,I was in my early 20's when I worked at Martin Marietta. It was a stepping stone in my career. I typically worked shift work.I was trained to due computerized tig welding.
good,I really enjoyed working at Martin Marietta.  My supervisor was a former boss from my civilian USAF job.  The morale was good and my supervisor made everyone feel like they were part of the team.  I left this position because my spouse accepted a job out of the area.
good,Good company to work for if you do not have much experience in any type of work setting. It is a labor intensive position that requires a lot of physical strength and endurance to work long hours.
good,"Good company to work for,  hours are good, management is good, overtime is good, not much of personal time off and work many hours when work is there."
good,The only bad I can see wrong with this company is the lack of hours when the weather is not good. Heavy rain or storm can prevent you maintaining your regular work hours fir the week.
good,Big company that doesn’t care about the “little” people— which are actually the most important. The ones that interact with customers everyday. The face that is put with the company.
good,"I enjoy working at different place because I like meeting people ."
good,"Is a good job with tons of work but low hours, they have a cam on your cab where i think they wont admit but they actually monitor you 100% of the day, wont allow you to use your device but their device is not up to date."
good,it's okay they you have a lot of 8 hour turn arounds  long hours no rain guarantee's for some plants a lot of 70 hour weeks when it's busy. Also can be very stressful.
good,This is a great company to work for. they take good care of their employees. you get a lot of hours. my only problrm is there is no work during the winter months.
good,"Long hours, learned lot about trains and earth movers. Helped with experience to use elsewhere as I get older and search for different types of work."
good,The culture and people are great but the hours are not. 60 plus hours a week with not much personal time.
good,"As secretary to 11 mechanical engineers all working under the eye of the NRC, I prepared all publications sent to the NRC for approval, all financial reporting for the Program Manager on a 10 million project. I did all the technical proofing of all publications which included my production of a semi-annual and annual report to the NRC on the programs progress. We also submitted monthly reports to the NRC on various sections of the program. I was in charge of all travel arrangements for all 11 employees for all conferences, meetings abroad and within the U.S. I handled setting up any meetings within our office and did the overhead slides for all engineers conferences especially my boss. I kept record of all office expenditures, answered 3 lines at my desk and handled the section phones when necessary which included 3 additional phone line transferred to me."
good,"Pros: Safety 1st overall, co workers are cool and helpful, they keep up maintaince of fleet, competitive pay, best of all the benefits are there."
good,"I like everything about this job but the hours are crazy you never know what time you will be starting next day in winter you work barely 40 hours and those are guaranteed even if you only work a day or 2 and summertime its crazy you work at least 60 to 70 hours and also your start time it's always in the early morning 12 am 1 am its depends how much we have to pour but in winter you dont get in that early usual time its 5 am 6 am or 7 am, the benefits are great the pay is good management it's alright"
good,"The recent shift in management has taken the company in a different direction.  This company used to be more family friendly.  Technology here is still far behind other companies. However, the company continues to grow in size causing a lot of manual work.  A lot of improvement is needed in the technology area."
good,dispatched vehicles for aggregate delivery...created orders for delivery  .handled customer compliants…..handles insurance requirements for truck companies
good,"It was a good place to work, opportunities to try different positions come open regularly. They do, however, show favoritism with certain employees. Management does not provide full training but expects you to understand your position fully."
good,"I loved working for Rocky Mountain Premix.  Everyone was friendly and for the most part was safe and communication was great.  Martin Marietta Purchased it and everything went down hill quickly.  Everyone was on edge with the change.  some people got cut immediately, others it took months but they started getting rid of people very quickly for very immature things.  They preach safety but in the end of the day if you don't complete a job due to a safety issue, expect repercussions from immediate supervisors and eventual termination."
good,This is a great company but your are limited in the security field for advancement.  The people are pleasant to work with and the hours are not bad. You live contract to contract which is nerving at times.
good,Looking to find something with more pay. Assemble or heavy equipment. Benefits are good but the pay is not all that well. I have been working at martin marietta for 3 yrs and people coming in as new hire are getting more pay than me and i have been their 3 yrs . So im upset
good,"Good company to work for.  Currently joined with Lockhead company.  Many locations to choose from. Good growth opportunities."
good,Every location is different. Depends on your immediate supervisor on how successful you are. Volunteer opportunities. Made some lifelong friends.   Overall workplace culture positive.
good,Ability to review and comprehend terms and conditions within various types of real property agreements. Two and a half year auditing project that populated a custom research database.
good,"A good company to work for, but management Procrastinates quit a bit, I feel like I'm under paid. All of my co workers and other people around the company are very helpful and more then willing to help or teach you new things."
good,"Great opportunity and career for someone who enjoys the construction, mining environment. I learned the more extensive aspects of monthly budgeting for large expenditures."
good,to be safe and productive at crushing stone being safe is very important management is strict about safety coworkers are very safety minded the hardest part of the job is making sure customers and contractors follow all safety rules the most enjoyable part of job is knowing you helped made a quality product
good,"Typical Day:  Morning meeting. Work tickets and answer phone calls."
good,Very poor management . Very Stressful inviormen. Unfair distribution of safe and decent equipment . Fast declining sales due to rapid and often price increases which is running off very longtime and valuable customers.
good,"good job with great benefits, horrible head mechanic. Treats everyone like trash. But overall it's an ok place to work. All of the plant managers are great."
good,Typical day scheduling short notice delivery orders. Preparing for a credit meeting or trying to reconcile and research customer billing issues and trying to answer calls at the same time. Remaining calm during stressful situations and being able to multi task is vital. The most enjoyable part of the job is being to help people out and resolving customers issues gives great satisfaction.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Very productive day and work schedule most of the time. Great atmosphere and also a very team work type environment.
good,If you are looking for a job in the fabrication department look some where else. The supervisor is a very rude and talks down to employees. He lies to his supervisor in order to look good. I have witnessed this guy yell at employees and harass others. I would say run if you have other opportunities you will be glad that you did!!!!
good,Do not wish to provide a review as many years have passed since my employment. I have provided a rating above and this should be sufficient to satisfy your need for accurate information
good,Fun people and hard work. If you are a Vampire this is the job for you. Because you will never see the sun again. After working there for 4 and half years I looked like a unhealthy ghost.
good,"The work is very physical and the outside environment is also an element you have to deal with.  There is plenty of overtime but the daily start time is text-ed to you daily. Work shift is day or night.  Hours are 8, 10 or 12."
good,Martin Marietta was a good company to work for before they merged with Lockheed.
good,Overall it was a good place to work with decent pay. And good benefits.
good,"The company has a good, positive culture and wants it to spread to all employees. Unfortunately, it doesn't make it down to the line employees."
good,"Decent benefits for decent work. Not a place you are going to move up, but plenty of hours to work. The work is pretty easy, as ok g as you have some common sense."
good,"-A typical day at work is operating equipment making rock with the quarry plant. "
good,Ran drill press and radial drill press learned how to read precise measuring tools.
good,"If you have a family, it’s hard to spend time with them. For a single person, the job is excellent. The pay and benefits are good. Paid weekly which is great."
good,"Martin Marietta has a big head and uses little common sense. If you had a family life before you went to work for them you soon wont after you start. Days are early long and non stop. Working mostly 6 days a week. If you are a driver than you have DOT rules they must follow , but if you are not than your hours can be unlimited and unmerciful, unless you want or like to work 72 plus hours a week."
good,"Overall job is good, but the way they run company is plum backwards. Pay should be better for the dangerous work conditions & almost on call schedule.."
good,"The manager at this plant did not have a backbone when other employees began disrespecting each other. While there were only a select few who caused a problem, the manager would listen to their complaints and not fully investigate the situation. This manager has since left the plant. I would return to work with this company without hesitation."
good,It was a job that had very little pay compensation. I had to travel throughout the city to the many different job locations. I did enjoy the experiance but I needed to find a more beneficial job for me.
good,Job was very fast paced and stressful. I enjoyed working there but there wasn't enough time to manage work and home resposibilities. This job is for a single person who doesn't have to balace the demands of this career and an entire family. This career has a culture like no other.
good,The pay wasn't fabulous but the benefits make it worth while. While working there they give you room for advancement.  Pay attention to everything around you and you will learn a lot.
good,good place to work as long you do as you are told of course but the rock quarry i was at the new plant manager plays favortism if you are not his pick he gets rid of you an if you are his pick he looks past the things you do that you suppose to get fired for
good,"no advancement or pay raises,promises are made but when ask about it they always have excuses. I would have stayed if raises were or advancement of some type were given"
good,"You get to weld different processes , like Flex Core or 7018 Stick rods."
good,A day at Martin Marietta is a safe one all day long. Martin Marietta cares about safety and does its best to ensure that everyone gets home safely.
good,"Most of the days consisted of troubleshooting and repairing conveyors and crushers to keep rock crushing production at its maximum. There are two methods of maintenance, reactive and proactive. With the reactive approach one is doomed to lots of downtime and patch work repairs. Proactive repairs attack the root causes of the impending machine failures and lead to near zero down time. The management was fair and honest and the other employees all seemed to be pretty satisfied with their workplaces.The hardest part of my job was figuring out how the make all effective repairs and modifications in a short down window between shifts. The best part of the job was the freedom to do the best job possible."
good,"Martin Marietta is a dedicated company that strives to delivery the best product and service while striving to take care of its greatest asset, the employees.  Overall safety is the company's biggest push, to make sure the employees on the ground are capable of getting the job done the right way and watching out for the other man by his side."
good,"Martin Marietta Corporation, Denver, Colorado June 1981 to August 1985"
good,The pay is competitive and the benefits are great. The downfall is that there is not much work/home balance. Specially during the summer. It also seems hard to find room for advancement.
good,Good company to work for always focused on safety and they really mean it. Lots of hours and can be stressed at times. They give you the necessary tools to do your job safely.
good,"Long work days or nights never set schedule, but when its rains you still get paid even if you dont work that day. a lot of people do help you there like a team."
good,It was a great company to work for I just had to re locate because I was having a baby but the benefits were great I had it all just had to relocate if I could work for them again I would
good,Great work place just the only down fall was that there was no way to move up in the company within a decent amount of time. I liked the fact of the job was consistent but not enough to lead you into a promotion .
good,"Performs truck dispatching with the use of Seltec Software. "
good,"As an electronic technician, I supported the development of the launch facility, launch vehicle, and the collection and processing of telemetry."
good,A person had the opportunity to get many different job/work experience. Employees worked together well. A person can take pride in the quality of the products made.
good,I loved this job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and my managers were great. I learned a lot about time management and working well with a variety of people and their different backgrounds. very good experience. wish I could of stayed longer.
good,"Print tickets to plant for orders. Make drivers schedule for next day. talk to customers about their order. They like to know why we're late on their job. "
good,"Working for Martin Marietta was enjoyable, but this was in the early days of the Space Shuttle Program. And it was a cost plus contract. Contracts changed and mergers began to where it was now Lockheed Martin. workload increased as well as demands. Loved the position that I had and the work that I performed. But with constant budget cutts job security was always an issue. I am truly thankful that I was able to make my 30 years and retire."
good,"Great company. They have good benefits, holidays/vacation. Lots of work/hours. The coworkers are great people. Everyone seems to have been with the company for several years. Everyone is generally informed on new things/changes happening."
good,"It's a good company to work for, the staff and coworkers are very helpful in training all the new employees. Hours are not decent though. Pay is not up to par with work."
good,"Driving a mixer truck quickly becomes super easy for anyone reading this that hasn't done it. The difficulty in this job is not being able to plan your life around your job as you will never know your next days schedule until the end of your work day, or how long you will be at work until they let you go home. "
good,"I went in as a temporary employee, assisting the Manager and working on some payrolls, ordering parts and supplies for the office. they wanted to hire me and when they talked to main office were told they could not add a new position for me so they had a parts EE was placed in position and lost all programs I sent him"
good,The safety culture day to day can be very overwhelming and constrictive.  They mean well but it can taken too far sometimes. The pressure to not get in trouble can be felt.
good,Worked with an outstanding group of professionals that are safety conscious and very effective at their jobs. Will miss them a lot
good,Typical day at work is busy.  I have learned to work well with difficult people both inside and outside the company.  My co-workers are very diversified in their work habits.  The hardest part of the job is not having much input in procedures.  The most enjoyable part of the job is doing it well.
good,"Work is not an issue, the job itself is great, typical office duties, need to be a tad thick skinned to work in a all male environment"
good,A typical day was going in early making asphalt with no problems in the plant & shippng the mix to the customers.I learned how to take care of the customers first so they could keep ordering from our company & of course take care of the plant so it could be available to serve the customers. Did do a bit of managing on the fellow co-workers & they were all great to work with except for one. The hardest part was losing my job. The best part was going in early making the mix & dealing with the truck drivers & customers & running the plant & dispatching both at the same time .
good,Worked from 16-18 hrs a day. Everyday was a challenge. I started from the ground up to being crew chief after 5 years.
good,"While there is room for advancement it only happens when someone leaves a position. Pay is great but work/home time is not. 12+hr days, 6 days a week in the busy season and 3-4 days a week in the off season. Overall a very safe place with good people."
good,They go threw plant managers like underwear i went threw 3 diffrent managers in 1 year they all want diffrent things some are better then others good people fredy an shannon are 2 great leadman
good,"Worked there for over 3 years. Was hired on for what they call a “Special Operation Team”. We traveled to construction location too work. The first job I was on lasted 2 1/2 years . Went to next job over 150 miles away and that one lasted about 6 months. Was long hours at times 90 plus , then some weeks down to 30 hrs. Weather played a big roll in our work. Was told before we were laid off of big jobs coming up but never developed. The pay was decent and paid a small per Deim . Found out later the company was making money off us on the hour and off the day rate."
good,Workplace culture is fantastic.  It was like working with your extended family.  Great company and people to work with.  The work life balance was good.
good,I learned how to operate some equipment with this company and enjoyed most of my co-workers. My supervisor was a great person and truly had employees' well being in hand.
good,"Great team work environment, collaborative, supportive management team, able to work a lot of overtime, but have a lot of early mornings and late nights."
good,"Order, Receive and Manage the Warehouse Inventory."
good,"Really enjoyed the people that I worked with, and the job itself. Work is hard and dirty, but great team environment and room to grow and learn. Good management."
good,This is not a typical job being as there are only a few underground mines in the U.S. and very few that operate on this grand of scale.  working 500 feet underground is definitely an unique experience.
good,"Coming from a nursing/aid background I had little experience in aggregates. They went ahead and brought me on as an employee due to my references and some knowledge of equipment from growing up. "
good,"Daily activities weren't too hard but lack of communication was always an issue. Learned a lot about the road grading and compaction specs as well as the process to getting roads and parking lots ready for paving. Safety culture was really good, they take safety very serious. Management was good, but again lack of communication was the biggest downfall. Hardest part of the job was all the moving around to different crews and the crew vs. crew mentality."
good,Martin Marietta Manned Systems offered me the opportunity to work on the very significant project of sending men and women into space.  I was introduced to different types of hazards that I was responsible for controlling.
good,Martin Marietta was the best training ground for a young aerospace technician. The culture of the company is what helps develop your integrity as a employee.
good,"This is a excellent working environment for good people. Employees as well as supervisors are all friendly Christian people. Despite the obvious dangers of the job everything else is top notch.The equipment is very well maintained for the use and conditions of the environment. Pay is fair but not great, benefits are very good for the line of work."
good,"tough work with good pay. also a very dangerous place to work. must always stay alert. yard crew is great to work with, good people with good hearts. management is straight forward with you and does not dance around issues."
good,Overall a great place to work if you can take the physical requirements of it. Expect plenty of long hours working in every condition possible. With this company safety is something they make sure of.
good,"A typical work day would be to keep a constant eye on incoming material, keep a look out for damaged clips, belts screens, etc. Help keep and maintain a clean work environment as well as upkeep to rock quarry plant. I learned many procedures and skills while working for MMM. Management was good and understanding as well as the co-workers, unfortunately half of the employees were related to management so it sometimes became a matter of favoritism.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing when you were done with your shift, as a plant operator, you are always the one left behind to finish all the little things. The most enjoyable part of the day was the drive home."
good,It was a very good company to work.  The pay was great and the turn around was low.  The culture and diversity of the company was a big plus.  The benefits were good except for prescription plan.
good,"Day to day operations of facility network infrastructure. Design and manage installation at several LMCO facilities. Many meetings"
good,You start out with a good wage and work more than 40 hours a week. Sometimes hard to balance life and work especially if you work weekends. Most benefits start the day you start there so that’s a bonus.
good,"I really enjoyed the work I did at Martin Marietta.  Most of the management in the company were great to work for.  The only issue was one upper level manager and I didn't see eye to eye, which impacted my advancement."
good,"Good place to work, good company, plenty of work, however......, For a billion dollar company, they don't pay as well as others ($3-$5 per hour less on average), they try to make up for it with benefit package (which is average for the size of the company). Also, they have an unlimited budget when it comes to fixing OLD trucks and equipment but they will not buy newer equipment (which seems inefficient, ineffective and, unproductive to me). I'm a class A driver for MM, I drive a 20+ year old truck which constantly has issues, when our supervisor asks for new equipment, he is told ""No, we're not a trucking company."" Not a trucking company? Don't we NEED trucks to do our job???"
good,Great Place to work. Always something new to learn and expand yourself. Upper MGRS. treated everyone well. every quarter your got a nice lunch and safety rewards.
good,"The hardest part of the job was not seeing where advancement comes in. There are only so many advancement opportunities and a lot of people so it's basic math. Not everyone will advance and it felt like it was more about who you knew than what you knew. That said, management did treat us well. Training was always taking place. Everyone there is willing to teach if someone is willing to learn, that was one of the best parts of the job. It is a very fast pace with lots to do but you have to pay attention at all times and safety is a must."
good,Overall I believe it is a good place to work.  The cross functional teams tended to be detrimental to the company.  It was hard to get support from other departments since the overall objectives were not aligned across the company.
good,"People are great as long as you work hard, and are willing to get dirty, I worked so many hours I didnt have much of a personal life, but benefits were wonderful."
good,I have enjoyed my time with Martin Marietta overall it is an excellent company to work for. They are willing to teach you really anything you express an interest in learning and help you advance into any position that you think may fit you well.
good,Learned skills fast enjoyed working with trains. Worked as a loner at times never knew what type of personalites you would get at work with co-workers always ready to help in any situation. Always liked the overtime when possible to get.
good,"If you have a thirst to learn about geology, manufacturing, and problem solving, this is a great place to work. Wonderful family atmosphere and management is always willing to help. My brother almost died in a motor cycle crash and I was immediately told to go and be with my family."
good,"I was harassed by an employee who came to my office from her place of work in a very hard confrontational manner. She was very disrespectful and I was her manager, so I asked her to leave several times without raising my voice, kept myself calm and once she stepped away out of my office I called HR to report the incident. HR from there took matters into their own hands."
good,"Benefits are outstanding. Compensation however is not. If you’re used to making $20 or more this is not the company for you. Very good company to get started in though if you’re new to Mining. Very safety oriented. People I work with are the best I’ve ever had. Management is ok, not bad but not great either. Can be stressful at times but overall pretty relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Martin Marietta is a wonderful place to work for, always room for growth and development, only thing is if they could give more hrs that would’ve been wonderful"
good,Good place to work just sucked I got layed off. People was easy to get along with. Company was all about safety. I would work for them again if they they was hiring again.
good,It was fine. it paid the bills and the check cleared the bank.  I spent the money i made on bills and life.  i dont know what else to say here so i am done
good,Two-year rotational training program gaining cross-functional experience & insight with rotational assignments in Operations & Supply Chain Organization.  Gained valuable understanding of the interoperation dependencies.
good,"It was the travel that made , from getting this job I was going have travel  an 1 in half to get to work. I would never left but do to the travel I had no choice."
good,"I would most definitely recommend this job to anyone. One of the safest companies ever. The guy are easy to work with also, great culture there like familt"
good,was a big change from what I as used to and almost crippling. The focus on safety is #1 but causes turmoil and non production because the culture is to tell on each other for safety voilations
good,The work was good and varied.  It ranged from structural to fluids to thermodynamics to dynamics.  My assignments ranged from analyses of PATRIOT to PII to SDI.
good,Decent company to work for. Good people relatively good atmosphere. Long hours make for decent pay check. Short layoffs. Hard but rewarding work. Great experience overall.
good,The work/ projects were very interesting and challenging. I learn some new skills while performing my job. I enjoyed the many aspects and improving my skills while working.
good,This was my first job out of college that provided me a great professional entry level position into engineering.  It was a vast organization that had many opportunities.
good,"Good company with great benefits. Train well, hard work but very good amount of hours weekly. Cross-training in various positions make it a good place to work."
good,"A good company with a lot of hours available to work. Some members of Management need to retire. "
good,very good work places I wish I could've stayed longer but I went in has a temp. if the would hire me back it would make my life. it was a great ground crew operators were ver help full when ever I needed to ask a question they were there to help out. and if they didn't know they know the person that would know my answer.
good,It's a everyday work but thier is not much moving around. People here are friendly and good going.I've learned to drive a dump truck
good,"Ran various lab tests to ensure quality. Data entry of various test results. "
good,A good day of work would be starting difficult jobs & completing them the same day. And having the supervisor remark & commend on the quality of work done. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was getting to know so many other employees & working with them for so many years.
good,"I tried to learn the business from some of the people that worked there, but they wouldn`t train well enough to understand the steps!"
good,Please see summaries in work history and accomplishment sections.
good,"We went out to the plant check it out so we get up and running.How to make the plant make more rock.They were happy when we put uot over 4,000 tons for that day.My co-workers are nice people to work with. Changing over for the next product that they wont to make the next day.Isgoing home at the end fo the day."
good,Load trucks and rail cars
good,"Great job, keep me going through my associates degree and kept me close to home to help on expenses."
good,"Great company, busy all year round. Awesome benefits. Management always there to listen. Most of the plants close to home. Salary is competitive and within reason."
good,"Martin Marietta is a great company.  It is not uncommon for people to work here for 20+ years, and we normally prefer people that want to stick around for awhile.  They have a pension plan, which is almost unheard of  today.  The IT department is fast paced and sometimes demanding, but it also has a relaxed and friendly culture that makes going to work enjoyable.  A lot of companies talk about work/life balance, but Martin really means it.  I highly recommend this company."
good,learned a lot about the comp. good comp.to work for  learned some different trades worked on the rock crushers some what worked on reclaiming part of the mountain after blasting was done.
good,"company looks after its employees. great benefits and pay. As being new to the environment, Martin Marietta brought me on board and made me feel welcomed. The training was provided and followed up in a timely manner."
good,crushing rock-putting tons on the ground all safely and going home at night --this company is safety oriented and is a priority to work here
good,Excellent company with plenty of upward mobility. Great people!!
good,"Did DoD work, but when the cold war ended so did we! We were a self-directed work force that allowed us to analyze problems and create solution to solve them. We manufactured printed circuit boards used in DoD weapon systems."
good,Everything was good in the being but the lead man was good too but I noticed he didnt want me to work or move up and he have favorite co work. And let me do a two person job with no help. If I get finish with my desk I would help other co worker but he would get mad
good,Its a good company to work for. Good hours and the people was great. Safety is highly enforced everyday. Pay was decent. They could improve on equipment.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with the company, great benefits, all the hours you want, caring management, room for advancement, disappointed in the opportunity to do out of state transfers"
good,"Work 20 years for them  good retirement benefits alw"
good,Martin marietta is a good safety oriented company that cares about the employees and pays competitively and they work very well with scheduled appointments and time off
good,black employees dont get promoted plant manger dont like black people at all and upper management knows it dont get me wrong the company as a whole is good just the leadership at this quarry is racist
good,"Martin Marietta is in the construction industry.  Many employees have long tenure and have moved up through the ranks.  However, the culture is very conservative and out-right politically incorrect.  Refinement of employee demeanor unfortunately did not conicide with promotions.  "
good,"Working over breaks between semesters at school, I was able to gain experience in several different departments. Management and employees generally had good relationships and management was very receptive to ideas/input from other employees."
good,"I did not have the opportunity to work long at Martin Marietta, but it is a great place to work."
good,I had the privilege of working on the future Space Shuttle launch pad as well as the Titan IV rocket program in California and Colorado with many interesting engineers and business partners.  
good,"Martin Marietta is a great place to work if you are one of the higher ups or are an exempt employee.  They offer a bonus program.  However, if you aren't an exempt employee....it's not as great.  It's harder to get ahead and get promotions.  Many times very stressful and you are unappreciated for your efforts.  Compensation in the non-exempt positions is in the lower tier.  You can probably go elsewhere and make more money."
good,Great fun friendly people great hours safety first at this company lots of work year round new trucks and up dated tracking and loading hand down the best in Texas turn over is very low
good,"MM is an awesome group of safe professionals who aspire to be ""World Class"" in Safety. The workload is very demanding but should be for the right candidate who wants the challenging career and rewards that their effort gives them. It is a solid company with a strong set of Ethics and Culture that are led from the top down. It is a great company to work for but lean on monetary compensation but at the same time there are other rewards from working for this outstanding company such as a diverse well rounded culture of people and small incentives and annual incentive plans. It was a great experience that I wish I could do over again. From a recent former employee!"
good,"Co workers are great, management people are fair and easy going. Working conditions are a bit dusty. Its a spot you can grow and change positions and move up in pay. lots of different jobs"
good,we wold fabricate all kinds of plane parts large and small. you need a good head on your shoulders to manufacture missing parts and make specialty tools
good,"I went in as a temp and learned so much about the department I was in was Used Sales Tax to which many think it is boring but to me it was such a learning experience to which I can add to my resume when looking for a permanent position. I didn't know each section of Denver has a different sales tax added. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Martin Marietta. You always seen a different group of trucks so the work day was never boring. "
good,"Great benefits!!! Good place to work, but supervisors need more management training on how to treat employees with respect and compassion. Flex time is nice, give you time to beat heavy traffic and spend more time with family."
good,My life changed for the better when I found this job. This is a great company to work for and the benefits are outstanding.But now the job i had  was eliminated and turned over to contractors. I like working here but i feel like I  need a change. I feel like I could be more useful working on railcars.
good,I am currently looking for a new job in the western slope area due to corporate decisions to pull out of the western slope area so I will be job detached..
good,They have 5 shops with both morning and evening hours. After you get past the learning curve of mixers it's all down hill. At first management seems scary but after some time you'll learn how to deal with them. The shop moral at some shops is high and at others low. Everyone pretty much keeps to them selves and stays busy. You can listen to music. There are a ton of safety rules but once you get used to them it's no big deal. You will learn a lot because you have to. They may send you to a class here and there.  Overall its a very easy place to work as long as you have a good work ethic. After a year if your a fast learner you'll pretty much manage your self.
good,Great company management is so chill and safety is top prority. Company has a family feel and everyone backs you up if a task is unsafe. There isnt really room to move up and you only get 1 saturday off a month but if it rains during the week they will mandatory the saturday. Equipment is in need of a update and dispatch is a joke.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a summer intern. The people were friendly, the job was interesting, and I learned a lot in the short time that I was there. I'll always appreciate the experience."
good,Aerospace welding Clean environment challenging and thrilling. It was very prestigious high quality work that needed to be preformed I enjoyed every moment there.
good,If you like to do something different every day and you need a challenge then this is the place for you. The Job was never dull and the people were unique.
good,This was a place where you could be really recognized for your efforts. The workforce was highly skilled and working in a matrix organization allowed one to move into different positions and increase ones knowledge and expertise.
good,"good to work with other very skilled techs.Very good working environment,plus some of the best co-worker and skilled co-worker that makes the job easier everyday.The hardest part of the job is reworking.And the thing i enjoy about lockheed was good mangerment and leadership."
good,"I work as a cement mixer driver and I haul loads of concrete to customers around Denver Colorado, and where Northern to Southern Colorado. I wish we could get a union started here."

good,"I haven't any reviews for Martin Marietta but  is a very good company to be employed . The management was fair ,workplace culture was fair .the hardest part ot the job was weather at times and the most enjoyable part or the job was teamwork"
good,very good benefits very good pay always busy fast paced good bosses good safety record good training long hours but makes night go by faster was sorry to be laid off

good,"One of the good companies to work for, Good co-workers, Very large company always room for growth, Safety is very important to the company. Good supervisor who listens and tries to help as much as possible."
good,Brett Niccum is a great manager that actually caress about his employees. The company has wonderful benefits and the culture is family oriented.
good,"This was a contract assignment and a temporary position.  It was a standard set of duties for the Production Office which I enjoyed very much.  I'd never worked in an industry of this size and was glad I was available to be of assistance in their time of need.  The duties were mostly data entry of mobile equipment hours, fuel and production and I enjoyed working with the CORE program and learning it.  The job was not hard at all and I enjoyed being treated like the ""kid sister"" they ""really liked"", even though I was older than most of them."
good,"I loved this work. Hired at entry level and progressed to executive levels within the company. This company employed about 20,000 employees at three separate plants in the Oak Ridge area. Fast paced and exciting"
good,"I would start the day sorting invoices for payment, and give out vouchers for workers in the field who needed safety shoe in order to perform their jobs, along with other accounting operations.The hardest part of the job was waiting for a promotion, however the most enjoyable part of the job was visiting various departments, and asking question regarding what everyone else was doing."
good,It’s a great company to work for. It’s a multi million dollar company great benefits I couldn’t complain. But there’s no work life going at 4 to 5 in the morning get off around 7-8 at night Monday through Friday and Saturday was optional. There’s really no room to move up unless somebody resigns or retires
good,Excellent  place e to work for sampled aggregates on a daily basis.   And tested the material to verify it meets atm and TX dot standards.  Test and report all tests as needed.
good,I started as a off road truck driver and was promoted to a loader operator within my first year. After 2 years I was promoted to Lead QC. I learned how to maintain the equipment and plant. I was also the back up scale operator. My 11 years there were very educational and the employees were great to work with. I graduated college while i was there and moved on to a supervisors role at another company. I would go back to Martin Marietta as a supervisor in a minute.
good,The working environment for this company was very productive in a way that everyone within the company and at the job site were always very busy with their tasks for the day.
good,"Asphalt temperatures can reach 350°F"
good,I loved working at Martin Marietta. I had the best boss ever. I was able to work remotely when sick and worked with a great bunch of people who all loved their jobs--it made it less like a job and more like a family.
