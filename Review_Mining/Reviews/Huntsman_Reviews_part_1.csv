bad,"Conroe Texas site is out dated in technology, training , culture, management,  and supervision. This site also lacks the ability to retain and recruit quality personnel. "
bad,"Not good co.take care be aware ,not good mgmt.not availability of system  of any "
bad,"Management ~ slaming your face off of cement. ""solution focused"" *sarcasm* they're not. Everyone here is on a power trip. Nickle and dime you at every turn. Spiteful. Bitter. The worst.. ."
bad,Not a-good place to work. A lot of egos and no teamwork. Very little training. It's a sink or swim situation. Supervisor are a no help. They are there for themselves as well as the management.  They hire anybody at that location. Convicts. Gangs memb
bad,"Very poor management, that will not allow you to provide more sustainable solutions than what they are prepared to work on day to day.  Don't expect or want anything other than what the management is used to delivering from old methods and minimal leadership skillsets.  Promotions within management within and assign to global projects without the skillsets needed for delivery projects, products, and support teams.  Expect 50 hours of work in 40 hours weekly, with no overtime approved for work.  No remote work is allowed.  Again, very bad management."
bad,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo con compañeros , pero desde que esta el actual director de huelva esta teniendo un comportamiento poco ético y profesional el cual influirá en la seguridad de trabajo."
bad,Very unprofessional team in HR Shared services department. The manager let them do as they please. They are stuck in their ways and will not help streamline and make hiring process more efficient. Would hire more green employees to help alleviate issue.
bad,"Good hard working employees ..."
bad,Harassment is strith and bullying is brushed under the carpet. keep well away not worth your time ! Worse place I've ever worked. No back up ! Terrible place.
bad,"Fermeture inattendu de l'entreprise, déçu du groupe."
bad,Place is so corrupt!!! Stay away no training!! Management useless and sont care. You do one little thing wrong your in trouble.!!!! Full of lazy people who dont help!
bad,"Must play workplace 'politics' or be a favorite to advance or be considered valuable.  Lots of nepotism within the Texas office, and obvious preference for Mormon faith followers.  No fond memories of my time there."
bad,"Working for Huntsman is by far the worst company I’ve ever worked for. Productions operators are held at very high standards with very little appreciation and compensation. Management is the main problem with this company as they do not follow their own policies and they operate by favoritism. Pay is low, while expectations are extremely high. Only good thing is they have decent benefits."
bad,"Great advancement if you were pals with Operations Supervisor !"
bad,"Being part of Zero Harm program, Fun Team, Room of growth, Strict yet understanding management, Mostly enjoyed analysing the quality and give my thoughts."
bad,I recieved inadequate training. The management didn't want to help in my advancment.
bad,wasn't given a fair opportunity!!! I did everything I was told and even things that weren't in the job description to help show the company that I was a team player. I was promised progress reports to show my growth and progression within the company and that didn't happened. I was laid off workout any warning or explaination of what I did wrong. Not happy with the way I was treated.
bad,Working in huntsman andheri is so much irritating. The project of the huntsman is not very well plan and the client of the company treated the lower staff as donkey.
bad,"Good hours , very few OT , poor benefits and low pay for the type of job in the industry ,Horrible management and poor facility. Save your energy and look for something better than this , this company is a good starter but not for long term. The starting pay is around  13 x hour and only authorize OT for their favorites . No flex acct , no pension, poor 401k plan. A lot of politics in management . Micromanagement from ppl that didn't even graduated from HS."
bad,It is a great place if you are happy in the same role with the same salary. Great benefits but very limited opportunity to get promoted. It could be 6+ years to get a promotion and entire career to get to be a director
bad,"Huntsman is a good company in terms of work life balance.  Definitely ""family friendly"" and people are not required to work a longer than typical day.  The issue has been a change in Senior Management and blatant Nepotism with hiring and promoting of family members of Senior Management.  Overall morale suffers as some people who have been working at the company quite a long time have no room for advancement.  There has also been a ""bullying"" culture that has appeared in the past year or so, which seems very counter-intuitive to how they have operated in the past. Benefits and salary are probably similar to other companies in the area."
bad,"A typical day is based on how production is running,   I learned quite alot about the pigment an chemical business, Ma nagement could have been a little more proactive. The worplace  culture was very enjoyable pretty due to my coworkers. The hardest part of my job   was a lot more difficult in my early years basically learning new procedures and keeping production running, the most enjoyable part of my job was learning to work indepedently and feeling very confident in my decision making process"
bad,"Outdated Culture, Outdated Dress code, Outdated Office, Outdated Technology, Outdated Management, Low expectations. However, everyone is very friendly."
bad,"Production works 12 hr shifts. And changes from overnights to days every 4 weeks. Morale was at an all time low when I left and had been getting worse. The only thing I miss, the people I worked with day to day. Most everyone there is top notch. But are not treated that way."
bad,"Typical day:"
bad,"It was a difficult place to work. Mormonism, hugging, and just alot of  really strange stuff. It was very from the status of a ""professional law firm."""
bad,"After the takeover of CIBA Polymer division and ultimately the shift of headquarters to Texas, the Advanced materials division has been through a crisis of epic proportions. In the former HQ in Basel the workforce has been decimated, without similar growth in the Texas HQ. Many of the former world class R&D groups have completely disappeared."
bad,"There is a large turnover rate in the department which former employees attribute to poor management by the department supervisor.  The workload is heavy because they cannot keep the department staffed.  Supervisor has control issues and does not work well with others.  If you are looking for short term employment in a discouraging environment, this is the job for you."
bad,Very Challenging Environment
bad,"New management uses other operators as a way of advancement."
bad,enjoyed being able to have the opportunity to work and knowing other people
bad,They promise a lot but seldom come through on their promises. Does not seem like it is a well run or organized company.  It seems like they have too many companies under their umbrella but have little control over keeping to standards and policies.
bad,"Very Corporate thinking. If you're not with us, then you're against us mentality. Not family oriented. Not a company that strives for your professional growth."
bad,"Technology "
bad,"Very good company to work for if you are lucky to have a good manager. Friendly co workers but very  bad management in my experience.  There is No job recognition neither good way to socialize with co workers,  very short break etc and no  easy carrier advancement. "
bad,Overall the company is good. The location and pay are decent but the culture is lacking in regards to respecting others.  At the HATC office being yelled at or spoken down to seems accepted.  The person perpetrating the act was said to have had a strong personality.
bad,"Healthcare pretty good. Management was not.  Some positions are overwhelming with the work others didn't have enough to last the day. Pay was low, comparatively.  Men paid more than the women even when the women had more experience."
bad,Lots of talented professionals but detrimental lack of leadership throughout organization. Would not recommended unless last option.
bad,Management does not have a clue. Benefits are the best around may be worth putting up with inexperienced management . Although if new management is not put in place then the whole plant will shut down
bad,Very hard worker I loved this job it was temporary an seasonal work I didnt like when the laid us off. I loved working there would love to go back but they wasnt hiring at the time.
bad,So stressful you do not have time for breaks. I did learn SAP during my time with Huntsman. Management is not concerned about their customers/ long term employees. The culture is not a caring or engaging.  The common theme of customer service associates is the most  enjoyable part of the day was leaving work at the end of the day.   The department is a revolving door.
bad,"I have to work with different types of people interms of personality, learned to look out for my colligues interms of safety. Learned that the way people approach is different and that some because of their approach will make your work easier even if it is too much of work. Enjoyable part of work is when everything is in specification and when everyone is happy i.e custormers. The management  not bad ."
bad,"-Overall very laid back atmosphere"
bad,This site is small and tends to fly under the radar and career growth is doubtful unless you move to Texas. Too many managers have their own agenda and there is little to no team effort. I would suggest that upper management audit this site's management team to make sure they are following company policies and procedures. Would not recommend working in the production or warehouse departments at this site.
bad,"I learned to use thermal analysis equipment such as TMA,TGA,DMA, and DSC. I learned the procedures for evaluating and formulating systems for use in the industry. I have learned how to work in a small group; working together to solve a problem using logical thinking and reasoning."
bad,"work is all subject to accepted permits, adjustments and additions, some compEX inspecting, i'm always developing new skills and never struggle to pick up new processes quickly, get on with both management and co workers, working environment isn't the best , i don't find any part of my job hard i thrive on new challenges and enjoy everything i do"
good,Mininmal job security.  The work load is extreme.  Not enough employees to cover the work load. Management could do a better job.  The benefits are great but the pay is low.
good,People that do work are assigned more.  The people that don't get less.  There is a poor management structure in place at Huntsman.  Everyone is not treated with equality and respect.
good,Tons and tons of overtime and  no regard for your family life!!!!!!  Very little room for error but again you can make a lot of money if that is what you are seeking
good,"Must be a self starter, learn independently, and work individually all while meeting aggressive work deadlines.  Co-workers generally helpful and courteous."
good,"La production de colorants pour le textile est une activité qui allie travail physique et intellectuel, un bon compromis entre travail sur appareillage et sur ordinateur pour le pilotage des appareillages."
good,"A company is supposed to be a place where you enjoy coming to work and enjoy the job you have. Not if you work at Huntsman, especially in the IT Department. The CIO of the company has made it such an uninspired place to work. Employees are not allowed to communicate with each other for fear of being accused of socializing, you are scruinized over your apearance on a daily basis and even goes so far as to play favorites among the employees and not care how noticable it is. This is the worst department in a company that I have ever worked for in my almost 30 years of being in the working field and would not recommend anyone in the IT field or administrative field apply to this company in this department."
good,"Need a little more Management Organization so employees don't work so hard trying to compensate for lack of planning..."
good,"Streamlined processes, Partiality done in grading and growth Job security issue & Poor Management. Not recommended although US MNC but work culture is poor managed by bosses with biased views."
good,"Sehr schwieriges Umfeld, seit der Übernahme von Ciba SC durch Huntsman, kein klares Konzept mehr, Betriebsstätten wurden wie eine Zitrone ausgepresst und WIR dazu benutzt."
good,"Pas de possibilité d'innover, prise de décisions groupe trop loin de la réalité terrain"
good,work life balance can improve and also the focus should be on people development and development in cross functional roles. It has good facilities at work
good,"Working with a team of PhD Chemists to develop and commercialize new products to tollers and Huntsman Manufacturing Sites."
good,I f the management was different it would be a great place to work. management team tries to put fear into everyone that is a bad thing who wants to go to work with that being held over their head . I do not that is fair.
good,"Huntsman is a great place to work for, although there might be a few bad apples to work with here and there. But for the overall it is a good place. Great benefits"
good,"Pay, benefits and work-life not the best not the worst. Frequent reorgs. caused fear every holiday season. 4 presidents in 7 years. Upper management come and go. Career growth very limited. Promotions based on politics more than merit blatant in recent years. Managers more disqualified and relied more on politics to keep authority. HR hostile. No training but dragging and squeezing. Overall morale going down. Safety issues can be covered up. Products and services less competitive. Dedication rewarded by insults. Accomplishments viewed as threats. Corporate attitude ""we can go without you"" rather than ""you are valuable"". A good place for some egos to make mistakes and let the company pay. A risky place for long term commitment."
good,"Worked most the day with supply chain, logistics, production specialists, purchaser's/buyers and sales management through email and phone."
good,If you are in management it is probably a good place to work.  Needs to be more communication with employees and better pay raises for the hourly paid employees.
good,"a good early start and breaks "
good,"Hard work. High responsibility level and sense of solitude can take place in day by day work."
good,I would proceed to the locker room change into my work clothes head on down to the lab. I would read any updates that were written in our turnover book. Do a quick assessment  to see if any samples were dropped off. Do samples if there was an urgency to relay answers to production otherwise procced on.
good,"A seguito di un'acquisizione il Management è stato variato ed è venuta a mancare la guida del gruppo di lavoro. Da allora pare che regni il caos e la confusione anche per quanto riguarda la copertura delle posizioni di responsabilità, affidate a persone senza esperienza."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my work is to be able to take financial decisions for the company and support with innovative solutions for banking and financing efficiencies. I have learnt negotiation, interpersonal and team management skills."
good,"Good work atmosphere. "
good,Huntsman is an employee friendly place.  Management does not provide sufficent direction.  They do not help you find internal opportunities to broaden your skill sets or advance your career
good,Good company but horrible management for contractors. Corporate office is very up tight. There is a very clear and imposed difference between the employees and the contractors.
good,"The day in the morning involves early meeting morning meetings where you review the previous days' jobs, production ,safety issues . "
good,"poor communication from managers, low pay. "
good,Lack of Career Advancement Oppunties. Managers could be performed better.
good,"I learnt about the differences in cultural, attitude, aptitude while i was there."
good,Good stable company to work for. Good pay an time off. good work environment. I would recommend this company to anybody that would seek employment with them.
good,Good checks and balance regarding IT management oversight and involvement.  Friendly work environment coupled with work place amenities.  Nice place to work!
good,"Come into work, sign into your computer, and take care of all the incoming emails.  Also make sure you take you lunch break  I am finished with this review. thank you very much."
good,"Good Company, location not convenient for me. Great people and challenging work - good teams and groups/ very modern facility with great services and perks"
good,it was a competitive place to work. we had old machinery in which we had to make work. the employees had to endure sub par equipment to make production quota. corporate did not understand or care about the plant problems
good,this position within the company no longer exists.  Again this position is no longer existing.  It was overall a good place to work but is non existant
good,Good company have advanced in the company. Worked there for 15 years and have had 7 jobs. Also had good training opurtunities and support.    Global company
good,"An excellent company with great benefits, but be careful if you use them often. They need people badly due to their 12hr. rotating schedule, and keeping employees is hard. Not good if you are single income with family."
good,Only worked there for a short period as a contract employee. Was a good group of people to work with while I was there but that was over 10 years ago.
good,"une journée type au magasin général est complètement aléatoire cela consiste a préparer les travaux du jour contrôle des pièces et quantité .(voir si pièce dispo ou relance de commande )."
good,"Very good company to work for, high technology, good people and co-workers. good working environment.It has been a good experience for me"
good,Decent place to work. Gained some new knowledge in different areas of the plant. Busy most of the time doing permits and hands on task in the plant.
good,"Fun workplace with supportive management."
good,"Work conditions adequate, above average. Co-workers friendly overall. Flex hours are nice, conducive to good work/homelife. Not as well organized as it could be but typical of most companies."
good,Everyday I look forward to be at work because there is always something new to be learnt e.g. safety share.The management and workers work closely together and they are all free spirited people. Every member of the team is important because we all play a significant role on the production line. Should anything go wrong on one stage the end results would be a negative.
good,"Giornata di lavoro ricca di imprevisti da gestire prontamente."
good,"Seems like a very good place to work, although, I believe they will eventually close my location."
good,The thing I like most about this company is the professional service.
good,"Work place is with high pressure"
good,"-First check the e-mail and resolve any urgent issue, check customer backorders and check help outs alternative to resolve it."
good,it is a good and growing sector.. which will help the person in developing themselve in future

good,"mon passage était bref car c'était une mission interim, mai sj'ai senti des tensions dans les équipes."
good,The environment was very hot. I wouldn't recommend this job to not one woman. My  coworkers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the extreme heat from the machinery.
good,"learning how to evolve yourself without any guidance is new challenge there, but still use full as this help you a lot while learning new things"
good,Huntsman Tioxide has a lot of potential for any Artisan trying to gain experience in the Mechanical field of study. The day is full of suprises as very day has a new begining. There are mechanical challenges and pressure points as this is a production process plant. There are key equipments that require 24/7 attention and the peers and subordinates are taught that safety is priority befaore anything else. Dealing with contractors who do not have this mind-set can be a challege but it is always worth it to teach and train someone to prevent injury.
good,Great location and benefits. Career advancement and employee recognition is lacking to none.
good,"I was part of a Project Management Team who had to deliver 2 projects, which were critical in the development of the site. We delivered both projects on time and within Budget."
good,"empresa muito boa, onde aprendi muito sobre processos logísticos."
good,"The company is moving in a very flexible and dynamic environment, which gives number of possibilities and opportunites for development for the associates"
good,"Quite high pressure work at times, especially first thing on arrival at 8am.  Most days the work was steady and manageable and then sometimes the workload was a bit heavier.  I learned how to use a totally new (to me) computer system that registered visitors and contained lots of information about them.  I learned a lot about health and safety as Huntsman is a chemical company.  The procedures, due to the nature of their product, are very stringent, and sometimes can be very time consuming which was frustrating at times.  The management were the same as most places, some very good, some not so good but mostly very pleasant and most had a really good sense of humour.  The hardest part of the job were the early starts.  Because I have to exercise my dogs before work, and I had to be in work for 7.55, it made mornings quite difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of the most highly educated people I have ever met - people who were very kind and funny and didn't take themselves too seriously."
good,"Typical day was running our machine to get the highest through put but also making sure it was a quality product by tacking samples for lab testing and also flow tests to make sure the pigment was in spec, worked with a great team of lads."
good,"employee satisfaction, safe woek place, good electrical clearance system,good ppe provided,entry of new employee training,safety training to the workers."
good,"great working place and a lot of learning for newcomers and experienced a better place for innovation and excel in the concerned area."
good,"There is no advancement for technicians, even if you acquire a 4-year degree you will not be promoted to scientist.  If you hire in as a technician you will stay a technician."
good,"In this position, I was responsible for production in three unit areas. Due to limited resources at the small plant, part of my responsibilities was  proper hazardous waste management in which I received extensive training and certifications. My other responsibilities included proper operator training, investigate and resolve supplier/customer quality issues, controllable fixed cost reduction, waste reduction, increase capacity, and safety leadership to enforce company core valves. "
good,"The reason I liked it there, is because I was actually treated like a human being... If they would have stayed open, I would still be there , no doubt about it"
good,"Overall Huntsman is a great company with a bright future.  Everyone is easy to work with and they are just great to be around. The senior management sets the example, an honest and trustworthy one. "
good,"Pleasant Work Environment.  Great Benefits."
good,"A typical Day at work starts at 9 am and ends at 5 pm. "
good,Great place to work but the role is challenging but can be rewarding.  You will learn a lot about the respective business from a commercial and technical standpoint.
good,"Empresa con un ambiente algo competitivo, aunque como todas las empresas tienen el lado sano de la competencia, dependiendo el carácter de la persona en cuestión."
good,"Above average work environment. Numerous challenges. OSHA Star. Behavioral safety program. Capital work process. Headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas."
good,"Huntsman itself sells a product that is highly lucrative and is a huge business winner."
good,Not much to say. It was a contract for the VIP Corporate office. I replaced a internal technician. The Internal tech was out in the field working on a project.
good,The thing that made huntsman a great place to work was the people around you were you can ask for help if you are struggling or even for laugh or chat but Huntsman Tioxide and workers felt like a family with good jobs day in day out with new breakdown and giving us challengers and I loved it.
good,"It's a responsible and caring family owned company which develop sustainability and its products improve life quality. I used to work in Shanghai Office. I work in that company for short time unfortunately. Apart from the company culture, supervisor's working style has to be taken into account."
good,"Had good experience working with Huntsman."
good,Great company but my location closed down. I worked for them about five years and probably would still be with the company if the location hadn't closed.
good,It was a challenging job with minimum support. My typical day was very busy. The travel time was not enjoyable and the area was unsafe/
good,"As an intern I had to work as a journalist."
good,excellent support and resources.  The people I worked with energized me daily.

good,"There is potential for improvement within Huntsman. Teams are small which is helpful, and coworkers are willing to help each other, but the overall office environment can be stressful and uneasy."
good,"Good place to work, able to learn multiple jobs in different parts of the plant to the receiving department to warehousing to sorting stock pulling orders and shipping the orders."
good,"Lots of room to grow within the company. Must have attention to detail as well as be willing to be a self starter. However, pay raises were not commensurate with work performance."

good,"This entry level job pays more than others, I noticed workers from Marine corps, so be prepared to work, from assistant press man to press operator, 12 hour shifts,  and lengthy training classes. The pay checks are definitely for raising family in here."

It was an engaging and exciting working experience. Good management principles based on ethics and values. A diverse yet accommodating workplace culture.  I Thoroughly enjoyed working at the organization and learnt a lot.

good,Great place to work if you have a family. Good job work and life balance. Not a lot of room to move into different roles. I work 10-11 hrs average a day. The 9-80 schedule is great. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team aspect.
good,"A typical day at work is full of challenges , new opportunities from customers, But we learn various aspects of the Industry, their requirements, our strengths , as well as where we can improve. Decision making at management level to grow business but at company's goals and profits . Sometimes it becomes tough to handle  situation or resolve quickly but then have to bid your time , take other's opinion and take a collective approach rather a unilateral decision . Most interesting thing is you get to work as a Team ."
