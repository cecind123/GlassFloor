rating,review
bad,"Company pays a draw that’s actually an accts receivable, you owe them to work there. Mgmt is a joke of wannabes and the product is average at best. They add junk fees to merchants that others don’t to increase profit"
bad,I was sold the dream working for this company and yet they offer you no salary and then expect you to learn their products in a short amount of time. When you have a different opinion on how you should run your business they will fire you. Get a salary position and don't waste your  time with a company who puts no investment in you.
bad,I would not recommend this company if you don't want to weed work in a call center atmosphere.  They don't tell you in the interview that you have to be in a phone que or at least they didn't tell me. You will have over 250 clients at one time plus answering the phone. Once out of training your hit with clients and you have to figure it out.
bad,"I had an excellent interview with the hiring recruiter "
bad,"Horrible conditions - no honestly managers "
bad,"This is a scam,these people recruited me telling that I would get paid to work at home. I should've known it was a scam from the amount they said they were going to pay (25/hour).They are scammer they sent me fraudulent check.Now I cant contact any of the ""workers"". I dont recommend working for them, good luck with these scammers if you do."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and keep as far away as possible from Heartland as possible. I tried to put together an organized way to summarize to make it easier for you. Things got drastically worse since they got bought out by Global, especially the HR part. All the positive reviews on this website about Heartland are usually from salaried people who get there fix paychecks on time and sit in a nice office. Not from the sales team like I was at."
bad,"Management is a joke. The director is a dictator. Specialist have high accounts and are expected to cover other specialist when they're out. Most members of management have no payroll experience and provide incorrect information. They pay very low, give horrible raises, even a fast food place gives more. No OT allowed but they expect you to work when their systems are down. Employees are unhappy but if you question it, you're ""blacked out"". This place has a high turnover. They give you a high amout of accounts, over 270, and the pay is a joke. They promise that they give rewards and it will pay off, but all they do is cause you stress and anxiety. Everyone who has left are happy and no longer carry the stress. If you make it a year, get experience and LEAVE! Currently looking for a new job!"
bad,If you wish to work remotely this job is perfect for those with enough experience in cold calling. For individuals new to sales this would be the equivalent of being thrown into the deep end of the pool.  Learn to swim on your own and on your own dime.  All commission and no salary along with little guidance.
bad,"Very micromanaging to employees, high employee turnover, and no raises or bonuses. Work is stressful, coverage for other employees job is mandatory and required almost every week."
bad,Very strict work atmosphere.  Management approach is to lead with emotions and not logic.  They target employees that seem to have qusetions about policy
bad,"Not upfront and honest.  Pure cold calling, leads are to be found on your own with pathetic outdated software.  The training is hilarious.  Anyone with sales experience will see right this this ""entrepreneurial"" opportunity.  Its hard not to snot yourself when the explain and teach their rebuttals."
bad,"Paid $13.00 an hour , training was very bad several trainers  supervisors not helpful ..Don't waste your time. They hire and fire it was not a good feeling."
bad,"Horrible company .. do not apply here, I repeat do not apply here. Over worked and underpaid. You have too much to do in your 8 hour workday. Plus you have to cover Co workers inbox and workload when they call in. You have to be on phones que also. All clients are unhappy and leaving the company. Horrible benefits.  You get a bill when you go to the doctor. Revolving door employees are leaving left and right just like the clients. Take my advice run Forest run.."
bad,Management of the tax department is unprofessional and unfair. The manager is best friends with one of the supervisors and she protects her and favors her. They have lost several good employees due to this and will continue to lose more.
bad,"A tad bit chaotic, management is unfocused with no clear strategy."
bad,"Typical day at Heartland, back stabbing, management is rude and not helpful. There are only a few people you can rely on."
bad,Sell credit card processing systems to merchants.  Cold calling and very persuasive sales approach necessary. 100 % commission based pay.
bad,I accepted a compensation plan that changed 3 times within my first 3 months. Then they decided to completely take away our salaries and said it would serve as an incentive to strive beyond our goals..
bad,"They fired me even though I had made my high sales quote for months on end and even had a bunch of high sales prospects in the pipeline..The reason? I didn't have 5 set appointments that week AND WASN'T KISSING THE DM'S BEHIND..She also waited until my TM was on the plane to for a two week vacation to fire me (so as not to have a say in it)"
bad,"The Great Lakes region is miss-managed as it can get... No Salary, No Support and scare tactics to the sales force.. High turnover is a simple explanation and as a veteran of the industry I was duped to working in a boiler room mentality.  Waste of time and money."
bad,"Manager was not there to help you as they say, but steal your customer, sign up your customer with high rate and lie to them and you that your friends and family is getting a good rate, lie to them they don't have to pay other processor cancellation fee. They make up work requirements to terminate you, after termination, they don't need to pay your residual income, also their unreasonable contract prevents you to contact heartland customers. I can't support my friends and families after termination. Do not sign their contract and work for them, very bad contract. There are a lot of other place better to work for and get pay much better."
bad,"I have taken many risks & enjoyed success throughout my sales career with various positions within Corporations, several start ups & within various industries. Heartland was by far my worst career risk & my worst career decision."
bad,Supervisor did not have any experience in payroll and never around to help when we needed it and to busy leaving early or playing ping pong in break room. When you tell him something he states he should have hired all men. Management retaliates against you when you try and talk to them about a problem and management lies to your face and they hire from the outside for management instead of within the company. When you go to HR with everything they said they will look into it but they don't and when you leave the company everybody knows the reason and management tells your business and what yall talk about with other co-workers so there is no trust.
bad,"Office is based on favoritism, cliques, and self interest. Upper management is new and very inexperienced in running an office and building a team. Majority of the staff wants to leave and management seems to be pushing the ones with good intentions out. Very poor training, sink or swim environment. Everyone has their own agenda and the office is very divided. Not a professional environment at all."
bad,"I was hired under a succession of lies into a job with no chance of success. Concerns are disregarded by management, whose answer to everything is “work more.” They talk and talk about their culture, which really is quite cultish and unprofessional, and could be called a scam. They know nothing about payroll and refuse to listen to payroll experts that they hire, thinking it can just be sold the same way as merchant services. There are far more professional companies our there in the same industries."
bad,"I worked for Heartland as a Relationship Manager and from day one was told not to seek out sales from some of the most promising local companies in my area."
bad,"The culture is currently changing at Heartland compared to when I was working there so my review may be outdated. However, during my employment at this company it was a flashback to the clicks and cultures of high school. It was full of gossip, back stabbing, and drama.. all of which was encouraged by management because they appeared to get a kick out of watching it unfold. It was a miserable place to work. "
bad,Was recruited from a former boss who transitioned over to Heartland.  Was promised many things in the interview that never came to fruition.  A very confrontational management team.
bad,"Though there are many, one huge disconnect between Heartland Payment Systems and Global Payments (to which Heartland is a subsidiary) is the fact that employees’ payrolls are frequently skipped.  And it doesn’t stop there.  Employee elected benefits are often improperly submitted to Global.  In my case, I had confirmation of my benefit enrollment well before deadline. Pay was actually deducted from my already lower-than-expected check for benefits.  This was from a direct deposit that followed a missing payroll, leaving me with less income than expected again AND without anticipated health coverage for scheduled appointments I attended.  After spending much time having to contact several people, it seemed Heartland could do nothing until some unknown person at Global responded. This took weeks and much time away from the field to amend, and still never completely resolved. The same scenarios occurred two enrollment periods in a row. "
bad,Worse management team ever.  Unwillingness to adjust sales strategies to changing marketplace or customer needs. The Heartland Playbook remains the same as it was in 1997...and will not change!
bad,"I hit my target number consistently when working there, and on 3 different occasions was not paid accurately with no concrete explanations of the discrepancies.  Management passed the buck consistently."
bad,"What started as an amazing company grew into a micromanaging nightmare. There's a reason ALL the top producers that were there 5+ years ago are all gone now. The micromanaging has now become legendary as it's beyond ridiculous. Report in in the am and pm and god forbid you miss your ""win"" you're threatened to be canned or demoted. No thanks."
bad,"competitive pay, terrible annual raises, misinformation and no communication. sales driven company focused on the bottom line. they do not care about their employees."
bad,"will hire really anyone with a pulse, and if you don't produce numbers for them they will basically give you problems till you leave on your own accord. I would not recommend this place to a family member or friend."
bad,Human Resources  was Horrible and unfair. Client Support is Racist. No advancement for African American Woman in Jeffersonville IN. Not Ethical at all. A lot of EEOC complaints.
bad,Called 30 businesses a day for credit card processing and was lied to about my pay which was the reason for leaving
bad,"I've been at Heartland for 12 years and it started out great. Over the years through poor management it has gone down hill. It is stressful and understaffed. They do not see the employees as people anymore, just numbers."
bad,"This is a company that only cares about sales numbers. Management could care less about company culture. Micro-management just does not motivate you to be a great employee. If you are a hunter and love to pound pavement, knock on doors and make cold calls, this is the place for you."
bad,"Hired as a Territory Manager because of my extensive outside sales experience   My manager seemed open-minded but flakey at best    He missed several appts, calls and failed to lead me in the right direction  His biggest fault was lying about verbally offering me two months salary.  My mistake was not getting his word in writing as he clearly made me the offer after receiving approval from his regional   Long story short, when you’re starting off, a company should not charge you for company literature or any expenses related to to the company   They offer you iPads, BUT with no internet.  You must pay for it, tag on to your hotspot, or ask a business for their password   By the way, they don’t pay your phone or MILEAGE    I was not paid for two weeks and when I resigned, my immediate manager suddenly disappeared  after repeated attempts to contact him there was no reply AT ALL, thank you Ryan.   HR is clueless, and understand that they are consistently hiring new “SUCKERS”.     Never again"
bad,Overworked and under paid. Management is a joke. The Director plays and shows favoritism to select staff. I have never worked for such a company like this before in my life.
bad,Certain managers micromanage their employees. Sales reps constantly get involved in client affairs and cause issues between clients and their specialists. Have to cover for employees that call out or have pto-the managers make you find coverage for when you are going to be out. System is constantly going down and delays payroll operations. Call center environment where they micromanage you being tied to a phone queue even if you are busy with task for clients or entering payroll on for a client.
bad,"Mid to high level management is not appropriately compensated, nor are they capable of making decisions or implementing them.  Very little support for the products sold.  The company keeps adding fees, changing the game up on the clients and the support to the sales group is non-existent."
bad,"The management locally does not have a clue.  He told me how much money could be made but, you have no training with Atlas Sales Platform.  The Management in the home office admits that the training needs work.  Very pushy to sign up customers.  Lot of pressure to sign up friends and family if they process credit cards.  Watch for the true up at the end of the year.  Never was told about this and I was told they take back money out of your commission if a customer leaves or does not put up the numbers.  Very Shady !!  Stay AWAY !"
bad,"New products are released without adequate training. Sales Support and Customer Service are severly understaffed. However managment continues to fault and punish current employees for not maintaining stats, that the company isn't staffed to maintain."
bad,"It was great at first, then after the merge, the company is moving my remote position to a different location which furthers my commute.  HR doesn't seem to be helpful nor understanding about how it affects me and my family."
bad,"I didn't see the large commission pay that I was enticed with.  You had to pay for your own marketing, business cards, etc.  Very competitive business."
bad,"Heartland Payment Systems was not the company that support their salespeople, and by that, I'm referring to all areas of the job and work schedules, including Tech support and Upper Management.  Other than that they seemed at the time to be a company on the rise."
bad,Not a good place to work. They are driven by a constant revolving door policy with employees.
bad,Heartland is not equal opportunity employer in my opinion. People seem to be picked for promotions instead of it being posted to apply. It is not about what you know it’s who you know  and who your related to. The company is not uniform when it comes to rules being implemented . Since the company has been bought there is no longer a secure feeling with your position as many have been laid off .
bad,"Cons"
bad,"I truly learned very little at Heartland. They don't know how to teach, train and develop their employees. Specifically, Robinson Moore and Tim McKenna are amongst the worst managers I've ever had the displeasure of working with. "
bad,"This company was quite possibly the most difficult to work for.  I was constantly fighting operational fires, colleagues were unhelpful and not interested in  establishing and maintaining a healthy working relationship.  Management team very unforgiving and uninterested in developing their direct reports."
bad,"Heartland has a culture of family in that the people (employees) genuinely care about each other and want each other to succeed. However, the compensation structure was severely misrepresented in the interview process and income earning potential is very limited. I did enjoy learning about Online and Brick & Mortar payment processing and developed strong customer relationships in a short amount of time. The middle management cares about their people. The upper management is not aware of the burden the compensation structure places on the employees. The hardest part of the job is that your compensation is not under your control. The processes in place can cause you to loose significant income based on the decision making of others not directly involved in the communication with the client."
bad,Great concept. Unreliable information. Meetings In perpetuity. Absolutely the worst manager to whom I have ever been exposed. I was miserable the entire time there
bad,The company preaches to new hires about a great work life balance but if you can't stay late every day you are considered not a team player. Keep adding more work to your workload and make you feel like you are replaceable at any moment
bad,"Heartland used to be a great place to work, but since it was acquired by Global Payments, the culture has changed.   Selling with no safety net is extremely difficult and the payout is ridiculously low for the amount of work done."
bad,Heartland is a great company for an experienced salesperson. It offers an excellent commission pay structure however offers little assistance in getting your career started.
bad,"Have fun working for a company that expects you to bring in a quota of revenue for them on a commission only basis. This is fine if the quota levels and support to achieve them did not constantly change. They do offer insurance benefits, of course you do contribute. No loyalty. They change management and their salesforce on whims. Worked there for 7 years and do not know 1 person still employed by them. You are on your own. No base,car allowance, cell phone, perks or reasonable awards for a job well done. No vacation days, in fact was always encouraged to not take any vacation days if my quota was not met. There are plenty of opportunities out there. This is not a good choice."
bad,Nice company to start off with if this is your first time working in the merchant processing industry. But this is not a salary job. There are no benefits or formal training.
bad,"Heartland has a lot of learning opportunities to transition from Customer Service or Terminal Support, to Compliance or Loss Prevention.  Heartland has an on site daycare, an on site cafeteria, as well as an onsite gym and outside basketball court."
bad,I was disappointed with Management.  Too much micro managing not enough hands on training. We had to call in everyday with our schedule.  We were constantly at risk of losing our job.  Our monthly quotas was unrealistic for a new person.
bad,Travel distance was stressful in addition to the stress of supporting so many managers. Work became stressful as well and decided to look for work elsewhere.
bad,"Company promoted fair upfront costs with unparalleled service "
bad,"Expect to travel to be 50-75%. The pay is somewhere in the neighborhood of 30-35k a year. Unless this is your first IT job and you plan on moving on, I wouldn't bother."
bad,"not a good place to move ahead in your career, not a friendly environment. Great benefit, but very unprofessional people since the company went public"
bad,Sales reps constantly leaving. Great company.The hardest part of the job is to get people to trust you and change their processor. They have false perceptions of who does their processing and not sure who to trust so end up staying with the company that's been overcharging them for years.
bad,"At the start of my day, I contact governmental taxing authorities in an effort to troubleshoot client tax issues from local to the federal level. In this process, I am in constant communication with clients as well as sales representatives overseeing the sales and introduction of the account."
bad,"not willing to train or provide assistant with developing relationship with field representatives, management showed favoritism, comp plan is set up for failure."
bad,This job wasn’t at all what I thought it was going to be. They’re very strict on you being on time and on how many calls you make and how long your calls last. If you mess up they’re slightly forgiving. The culture is great but with the amount of calls that you’re required to do greatly outweigh the culture and some of the benefits.
bad,"It’s all about if you kiss butt whether you advance here. If management doesn’t like you for whatever reason watch your back. Other than that it is a good place to work. A billion dollar company that watches every penny, would rather give you shirts, hats, cups, etc than just give you more on the hour."
bad,only get rah rah emails and videos to watch.......Could careless about retaining quality employees who may have a tough month or two....Total disregard to team work...
bad,This opportunity is great for someone who is retired and killing time while working on the field trying to prove him or herself to the organization or just graduated out of college and wants to learn business sales. This job is certainly not for the seasoned professional with an education.
bad,I thought the facility was great the Management was awful and racist they need to get a new HR Director and all new upper Management
bad,Terribly ran accounting department. The supervisor defers to another employee instead of being a leader. Very disrespectful. Unprofessional. They all talk behind each others backs and argue with each other in front of everyone. Worst accounting department I've ever worked in.
bad,"The training is terrible.  The procedures and metrics are non-existent.   Pretty sure we just screw stuff up all day long because we don't know any better.  Technology is lacking and outdated.  Hourly wage starts off decent but the raises are small and there are no opportunities to earn more. Management does not encourage suggestions for process improvements; suggestions given to management are replied to with ""that could happen in about 20 years"" or ""I wouldn't open up that can of worms if I were you""."
bad,I worked for Heartland for a little over a year. They are a company that prides its self on being entrepreneurs serving entrepreneurs. They lacked proper support to their own sales representatives.
bad,"We would come in log into our phones and start taking calls immediately and taking care of the complaints as soon as they came in and it was one right after another."
bad,"Was recruited based on my past success in a similar B2B position with a Fortune 100 ""Best Place To Work"" company .  Was informed that Heartland modeled their training and compensation after this company.  It couldn't have been farther from the truth. The training is ineffective, lacking in comprehension and sporadic.  Poor at best."
bad,They have a competitive starting pay but only give 1 to 2% raises after that. Top is 3%. Not many advancement opportunities.  Lateral moves to different departments for same pay. The hr manager was extemely nasty and hateful .
bad,"Starting pay is decent but after that you hit a wall of .20 raises the rest of your career. Mangement is untrained and positions are filled by family members or friends instead of the best qualified candidates.  The CA training is difficult and the phones never stop ringing.  Your will be on the phone non stop your while shift trying to explain products that you haven't been trained on.  If you ask your supervisor a question, you will be given the run around or they will advise you to get the merchant off the phone ASAP and then you can ""escalate"" to other parties that may know the answer.  "
bad,This company started out great. The last year I was there was awful. They knew there were problems but wasn't doing much to solve those problems. Working people need to shut off the work life when not on the clock and remember not to overload yourself. You can only do so much; you are only one person.
bad,This is not the same company that I worked for. This was a great company to work for and then they were purchased and things started to change. Heartland has a great product with terrible management and doesn't care about its customers any more. All they care about is if you make your goals and if they are making money.
bad,"If you have not had experience in the payroll world do not do this job."
bad,"As CEO wants company to grow, poor decisions are made. "
bad,"the job its self was ok, the managment wasnt so great.in one word ""heartless"" I did enjoy most of the custumers i worked with daily on the phone. enjoyed helping them .."
bad,"My time at heartland started out pretty sketchy, I was given the option to select my schedule, I was told that if it didn't work out that they did ""shift bids"" all the time and I would be able to change. Since starting my employment working every weekend, I have not been able to get a different shift. I have since used all of my pto time in order to do things on the weekend because there isn't ever any time available to use on the weekends. You are suppose to check the pto calendar to see if availability is there before you submit your request in, however not all departments are ran this way, and downstairs seems to be more organizes and ran much differently that upstairs."
bad,The expectations up front are extremely unrealistic. You have to be able to work for free for a long time before getting a steady income. Then you have to go through several obstacles when signing on a client that are easy to be confused or miscommunicated. .
bad,"I learned that I was truly a self-starter, management was fine to work with, the staff was friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the clients. They weren't nice and was very rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I left the company."
bad,For the amount of work you do for this company they need to pay a salary. The dream looks good of the earning potential but for a company with no brand recognition against adp and paychex they need to reconsider being commission only.
bad,"Approach to developing new projects is a bit backwards. Specifications are typically not gathered until the project has already been in development, which results in changes having to be made. The upside is that the teams are small, and you're typically left to work on your task on your own if you'd like."
bad,The hardest part of the job is cold calling on Merchant that are aware of the broken credit card industry.I learn a lot about this industry.The majority of the employee's are professionals.
bad,"Job was very stressful , lots of help and support but if it’s not what you want to do long term the stress is not work it :( very hard trying to juggle home life and work life ."
bad,There is no organization within this company. The payroll system is terrible.  There payroll concepts are non existent.  I went 2 months without a phone. I was told to call clients on. my cell phone
bad,One of the worst experiences I have EVER had working at a sales related business. Straight Commission and overall DISASTER. Completely different Comp plan than is relayed up front. WOULD NEVER work there again.
bad,Heartland has spent a lot of time and thought into their training classes.  I learned valuable skills that I can bring anywhere inside the sales realm.
bad,"Very tough business that requires a thick skin. Industry has a bad reputation in general, so always having to overcome that aspect of the  job."
bad,This was a door to door or cold sales type role in an industry which has some negativity.  This was just not my cup of tea.  I enjoy relationship management/account management type selling or being a sales manager.
bad,100% commission. Long days driving around. No leads. Tough business. 
good,"Being a Loss Prevention Analyst for a credit card processing company is a very stressful job, one that I have done for over a decade and very well I might add. However, if an individual isn't related to upper management, dating upper management or good friends then it's very difficult to advance within the Company. Favoritism also plays a very big role withing the organization. "
good,"Yeah...didn't pay well...didn't even try to pay well."
good,"Heartland Payment Systems/ECSI"
good,Unexperienced management will ruin this company. Its really a shame that they put unexperienced managers in those positions.
good,The Office Administrator is very unprofessional.  She does not approve of promotion for her own team.  That is why I had left.
good,"Work/home life will be hard. 60+ hours per week is pretty typical.  A few people in the management positions were basically ""yes Men"" and truly didn't care about the happiness and well being of their employees."
good,Was not a bad company when it was Heartland but with the buyout it has gone down hill. Global is more of a corporate company on how they treat there employees.
good,many changes have occurred over the past two years which have had a direct impact on sales. No help with development. Good back end service. Customer service is really good
good,The company as a whole is amazing. My direct leadership not so much. He was allowed to discriminate and harass me regularly. I was felt to be not supported by my direct leadership.
good,Heartland Payments systems can be a great place to work but there isn't any structure. I feel that once the environment becomes stable it will be a great place to work.
good,"Day shift starts at 7 am.  Take turnover from night shift on previous nights events and any current events that need to be engaged in.  Monitoring for any problems taking phone calls for any issues.  9:00 Operations meeting to discuss previous days High priority tickets.  Monitoring networks, servers, file transfers, CICS regions and internal and external websites.  Working trouble tickets through the day. Possible high Priority 1 or 2 incidents that require conference calls for engaging support for trouble shooting.  Daily 15:00 Change Management meetings.  Prepare turnover through out the day to turn over to night shift to take over"
good,More senior management needed to offset the very young and inexperienced team in both sales and corporate.
good,"sounded good, started good, then the chargebacks begin and the quotas are raised."
good,"A typical day at work has changed over the last year. The Atlas system can take over your life and interfere with your productivity as you collect data (uncompensated) for the company. The cost of Atlas has costed sales people in lower margins and all the work you do, you have it on proprietary software, so you get to work hard for free. Those who left the company had worked hard to collect leads and the veterans benefit from high rate of turnover. My manager had/has toxic secrets the co. was/is not aware of as it was/is kept under the radar. Those who knew about it were cronies who benefits from the high rate of turnover, capitalizing on the work those poor souls endured; only to get free leads. There is a game going on. Some very good talent is becoming victims of prey, which is going to cost the co. in the long run because management operates only in the short run. The cronies will never reveal management's toxic secrets because they won't slap the hand that feeds them."
good,"Difficult and complicated business, 100% commission with almost no leads, managers play favorites so you won’t get leads if you’re not a favorite, if you don’t meet quota, you get fired so that constantly looms overhead, just raised monthly quota from $6,000 to $8,000.  Most do not make it."
good,"I feel that the industry has a hire turn over because of how Credit card processors are labeled as dishonest.  Heartland does believe in doing whats right for the merchant. I do like that about the company. But merchants are  dealing with 1000's of reps calling them every month with the same story.  Very difficult industry to try and get started in.  Lots of rejection, more than the normal person can handle."
good,"Overall, good company to work for. Very competitive industry. To much micro managing lately. Some expectations are very hard to achieve. It takes time to build up your client portfolio in this industry, but upper management is looking for results right away and has no patience. It can also be a very long sales cycle."
good,HPS is not a good place to work. I tried to help change the environment to improve for all.  There were too many layers of management that seemed to protect each other. Too much nepotism at the top.
good,"Nice people, good training, but you had to pay for your own phone, lap top and mileage.  I was always in the red and it is a commissioned based job only."
good,"It could of been a great company, but the compensation plan was reshaped and wasn't really all that great.  Once GPS took over it was all down hill, which is too bad because they have excellent product and solution offering."
good,"Heartland and it's culture have changed significantly over the past 3 years since I started working there.  I have had tremendous success and met some great people at the company.  Low level management is fantastic, higher level management has a lot of room for improvement."
good,"Daily worked leads, qualified, educated, sold and installed equipment. Commission only pay. ""One dimensional"" management style got old fast."
good,"Company was well run under previous owner. Merged and culture went to not giving the same service and pricing to making profit and hidden fees. "
good,The raises were very small. Management threw employees under the bus and micromanaged. The hours are not very flexible. Was a struggle to schedule vacation time.
good,"My role was to keep WebSMARTT customers happy, and sell them as much hardware and software as they needed to be successful."
good,"It is a good place to work if your job is your life. Not much patience with people who are slow learners. Need a better training program to learn software as complicated as their product. The more you invest in the employee, the more valuable the employee becomes."
good,The business was acquired by Global Payment Systems. It has become a challenge to get deal done with underwriting. Not a strong presence in Las Vegas.
good,"Heartland upper management is not consistent and training often wasn't given before the product release and often caused miscommunication with merchants and sales teams. I did enjoy the multi tasking and different calls, healthcare was excellent along with other benefits such as a free gym and onsite child care."
good,"The campus is very nice with an on-site day care center, a gym, and cafe. Very corporate environment. Work/Life balance is extremely poor even for those in management. The amount of micro managing you receive depends on your supervisor. There are lots of seat moves and supervisor moves to deal with. The start out pay is pretty decent, but the raises are small. The insurance is a high deductible plan. Over the past 5 years the incentives have been slowly taken away from both the customer service representatives and the managers. They do have a degree program that is free but your schedule must accomodate the class schedule."
good,"A good company which takes care of the business you bring in and has good customer service support from service office."
good,Stressful department atmosphere with time constraints and pressure from management and sales representatives to help meet sales goals. My co-workers are stressed as well which effects the team oriented atmosphere that we are supposed to be working in which adds to the tension and stress at work. More incentives and less micro-managing for a salary position would promote trust and lighter work atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep up with the time constraints while our hardware and software either goes down or slows down. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing my manager understands we have families and the need for a balance between work and life. I also enjoy knowing I have completed my due diligence in assisting a sales representative meet their sales goals for the month.
good,learn to be a self worker...and become a real responsable worker ..been by yourself in the sale area ...good managers 
good,"A typical day I would have 5 appointments scheduled. An install, A service call, and 3 Account reviews. I would drive approx 100 miles. I would call a good day, when I was able to make a difference to that customer, resolving a problem. The hardest part of the job is handling upset customers, they cant take credit cards because their terminal is down and they are losing business, and I can't get there fast enough."
good,"Business to business (B2B) sales. Responsibilities included the hiring and training of salespeople, meeting sales quotas from a personal and team perspective. Acquired a high level of expertise in prospecting, building and maintaining relationships, and following a consultative approach in various sales processes. The hardest part of the job was staying abreast with all of the new products and/or services due to the structure of the workplace being a work from home environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is closing the deals and assisting fellow salespeople in closing their deals."
good,This company isn't family oriented unless you are part of the head of the family.
good,"It’s not for everyone. Is great if you’re ready to be moving around all over the town. They taught me how to be a good sales person. Organization, consistency is the key.  it’s a really stressful job."
good,Company does a lot for the reps. However some supervisors and managers are not to be trusted. Depending on department it's alright. Csr area I would skip
good,"Had weekly production goals and monthly sales goals to achieve that were hard to attain.  Training was acceptable, but not at the level needed to fully grasp industry concepts needed to become fully functional within the timeframe required."
good,"General corp policy is to have layoffs around Thanksgiving and offer pitiful severance packages. ""All roads lead to card"" if you are not on the card processing side of the business your division will be regarded as a second citizen."
good,"Nothing especially unique; the usual workplace drama and minutiae that exists everywhere.  One particular cultural element of note is the fact that teams and departments tend to operate in their own silos.  This leads to a lack of teamwork and impenitence to large cross-team initiatives being completed in a timely manner.  If you like collaboration, this may not be the place for you.  However, there are teams that overcome this and work well together.  Do your research, talk to your hiring manager, ask ALOT of questions.  Heartland and, in turn the parent company Global Payments, can be a good place to work with the right team and right leader.  There are opportunities for growth, access to advanced technology, good benefits, etc.  It is really a case-by-case basis."
good,Excellent opportunity and a good company. Very similar to insurance industry. if you can survive through the first 5 years you will be rewarded with riches beyond your wildest dreams.
good,To much time spent on completing reports and complying with ever chaning metrics.  The card industry is crowded and more price driven that value driven
good,My boss was great. Very good training.  Just a very hard sell.  Not many people in this area willing to change.  100% commission which is very difficult.
good,Higher Level of management not willing to look at workload put on employees. There are some nice people however as in most cases leadership can be very negative. Not a good environment if over the age of 45.
good,The bad employees are rewarded and the good employees are not. Management does not display what they preach. No loyalty to the employees.
good,"High Strung Sales Environment, the job was my life, great boss, Fun team, great benefits, 50% commission, monthly residuals from each sell"
good,"Working for Heartland was a great learning experience, I was able to travel around the city and meet many business owners.  I gained most of my sales experience from this company."
good,"* Increased annual revenue from $2K to $500K with a 52% gross margin in four months by initiating Managed Network Services campaign through a select group of Sales professionals."
good,"Normal workday in an office. Coworkers are awesome!!! Does provide health benefits, college courses on site, and ample parking."
good,"Typical call center setting, office tries to boost employee morale with parties and themed work days. employees seem to enjoy the work and atmosphere,"
good,Heartland gives you the opportunity to run your own business with an amazing comp plan. You must be prepared to take a position here with a network that is ready to sign. It is commission only with residual portfolio equity which takes time to build.
good,"Kind of on your own no office locally ipads and your home is your office. lack of employee employer interaction."
good,"100 Phone calls per day. . .no real formal training, remote location, independly working on developing business appointments, lots of driving daily to ""cold call"" on small local businesses"
good,"You spend your day on the phone or walking to businesses to set up meetings. When you set up a meeting you must be a good listener to make sure that you can work with them and to find out their problems. While working here you must be okay with working by yourself since you will be on the road by yourself. I have learned how to make sure I organize my day to make sure there is no wasted time. The people on the team are good people, and the hardest part of the job is not stressing out about not making a sale, and to make sure that you push yourself since no one is there to push you."
good,Everyone is family.  There is no better group of people who care and will drop everything to help out.  There is a genuine want to succeed among the employees.
good,The workload that I was given was difficult. I would ask for help but was ignored. Then my supervisor and manager would tell me that I should have asked for help when I was under water! What??? I was happy to get as far away from there as possible.
good,"This was my first sales job paid on commission.  I did very well.  However, the industry was saturated.  I did not like the industry once I was out there talking to business owners and learning about how credit card processing was making life difficult for them.  The industry was so saturated at the time and I was simply not aware.  I gave it a chance and decided it was not for me."
good,Good place to work. Most everyone there was good to work with. The pay and benefits are pretty good.Their is some favoritism that goes on there that causes some employees to advance into positions that they are not qualified for in the lest. The head of HR is a very nasty person. The best thing to do is avoid her as much as possible.
good,100% commission is not for the faint of heart. The industry is very competitive. If this is your first job in the industry you better learn quickly. You will be rewarded well if you just keep going.
good,"This job was commission only.  It didn't matter how many clients you signed on, it mattered how much money that company made.  You could have 10 clients one month and make less money than if you had only 1 client the next month.  It is difficult to ensure a steady income."
good,"Some of the other tasks that I do on a day to day basis were not in the job description. Other than that, it's a fair company to work for."
good,"Typical day is ongoing management of projects.  Learned about Enterprise Agile.  Management was supportive to their abilities, Co-workers were not extremely welcoming and outgoing.  The hardest part of lack of challenge in my role.  The enjoyable part was learning the industry"
good,"Establishing leads, attending networking events and client visits were a typical day. I learned to sell merchant service products to merchants based on their business needs. I didn't have the opportunity to work with co-workers as our manager did not bring us together often. The hardest part of the job was missing the opportunity to collaborate with the team. The hardest part of the job was missed opportunities based on competitive pricing. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping merchants understand how to read their merchant billing statement."
good,"On the phone for 1.5 - 2 hours in the am, cold calling. Appointments in the pm. Pulling door handles in between."
good,"This company had no support for sales, no salary and no expenses covered"
good,"Overall, plenty of room for growth and opportunity. Managed great and employee driven"
good,"Heartland is like the athlete on team that shows so much promise but never can quite live up to its potential.  They talk great game, but execution is poor.  Its top heavy management, meaning there are way too many cooks in the kitchen fighting over budget and strategic goals seem to change frequently killing chances of being the top dog in the industry.  They beat on sales people to make numbers and dont care about turnover.  This is their understanding of the way a company will persevere through time.  Sheer blood, sweat and tears through a wake of dead sales people is how they will achieve their goal...whatever goal that is."
good,great place to start if you are trying to learn a new field. This is a great family environment. I learned a lot about the payroll industry. Continual training.
good,"Follow the Heartland Playbook!  If you commit to following the Heartland Playbook for two years, you will acquire residual income to last you for the rest of your life!"
good,"Heartland has an advantage over some of the competition as a direct card processor, but competition is fierce. Target market for a relationship manager is to small/ medium size businesses. These potential customers receive several calls each week from card processors and these relentless telemarketing calls along with cold call visits can be annoying. Thousands of independent sales companies marketing this service."
good,Flooded industry and 100% commission based position. You have the ability to set your own meetings but there is no travel reimbursement and is 100% cold sales.
good,w2 100% commission; not much ongoing training....initial training was to be with my territory manager but was lacking; so my district manager took over.  Mostly a mentoring role with feedback and help to make monthly sales goals.  This is an unregulated industry and tough competition.  Merchant trust  is hard to build and the market changes all the time.
good,"Flexible place to work.  Amazing team members.  Life/work balance. A great place and position to meet new people, new places as far as visiting all types of businesses."
good,average job. good job for someone coming out out of college or first big boy job. growing really fast. if you like working in a call center this is the job for you.
good,I do not wish to provide additional details on my experience at Heartland Payment Systems.  I have been employed for many years and would like to explore other opportunities.
good,"work and life balance good."
good,The job was straight commission and all cold calling.  Didn't fell very connected to the company but great work/life balance.  If it wasn't all pounding the pavement it wouldn't be a bad job.
good,"I loved my management, they did everything they could to help me succeed. However, this industry is so broken the it made my job incredibly difficult. Certified leads were nearly impossible to land between me and my boss. I busted my butt for the entire time I was with them, just to go broke and run dry. I loved what I did, speaking with businesses on a daily basis.. but the business owners have been lied to so much, it makes your job extremely difficult."
good,This was a good job.  I moved on for I was offered a job with a stable income .
good,As an outside Sales Rep you have the flexibility to work your own schedule limited only by the schedule of the business owners you try to interact with. I learned to effectively schedule my activities in a way that I have the best odds of getting face to face with my clients.
good,"Commission Only, daily door to door or telemarketing to area business owners to present company offerings in credit card services, HR/ Payroll or marketing services"
good,"The online and conference call training was intensive and meaningful; however, there was not nearly enough personal field training so I felt like I was on my own too often."
good,"Check email, and set-up for meeting for upcoming Agendas. I learned that every client is important, no matter what size their needs are. "
good,"A minimum number of applications are expected every day. The interviewers told me 1 position was being filled, so I expected 1 on 1 training. Instead 5 people were in the class, and 3people had been in another department related to underwriting. These people moved training too quickly, above my head ,with no control taken by the trainer. Hey seam to hire people based on the phillosophy of throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing what sticks . They are always hiring for this because people do not last and meet the numbers daily. You will be written off quickly and they start ma,aging for the firing by showing they do it properly. Document everything you do and say, , for the best outcome."
good,"Work day is consisted of prospecting, presenting solutions to merchants and installing merchants equipment.  Hearltnad specializes in fair and transparent pricing."
good,Do not have an opinion. Do not want to answer this question. This should not be part of signing up to find a job. This is utterly ridiculous to answer this question if someone does not want to.
good,"Some days are extremely overwhelmingly and others not so bad.  However, you can learn a lot and transfer skills to other careers.  The lack of communication interrupted the effectiveness and culture."
good,"15-20 cold calls per day, assisting existing customers with any issues or problems  mangement helpful and caring   hardest part of the job is securing the initial appointment with potential customer   the most enjoyable part of the job is creating long term relationships with customers"
good,You make your own schedule.
good,"Management is great and coworkers are always nice and willing to help. The environment is laid back. It's a good place to work, especially if you are trying to get into a full time company and out of retail, etc."
good,"company is a good company to work for but very bad manager to work for, people are leaving to go to other districts because of this manager, he seems to favor certain people and forgets about others"
good,"A great working environment, where people treated each other with respect."
good,The clawbacks due to early termination of accounts and boarding contributions can wipe out your residuals. You are also covering all of your expenses which can add up.
good,"School project to familiarize ourselves with the four steps to system design: Plan, Analyze, Create, Implement. We created a website for KickOff4Kids to help with one of their after school programs. Unfortunately our website was not chosen but I gained valuable experience in systems analysis and design."
good,"I really enjoy and respect the people I work with.  They are talented, driven, and do whatever it takes to get the job done.  It can be frustrating, however, to work for a management structure that doesn't seem to value the experience and/or input of its employees, or never gives them credit for bringing time-proven ideas to the table.  Too much responsibility is placed at the management level such that lower level managers and development staff aren't able to contribute to the process, and when they do their ideas are largely discounted."
good,"Tech company which has experienced rapid expansion in the last few years. "
good,"A senior developer with more than 18 years of professional experience in designing, programming, and developing large scale software applications with the ability to manage complex software development projects by applying leadership, software engineering and software lifecycle techniques. An IT professional who employs communication and technical skills to design and implement web applications and enterprise services using proven technologies, emerging programming languages and frameworks with specific focus on enterprise application development involving J2EE architecture.  I enjoy mentoring other developers about new and effective software development techniques and methodologies."
good,"co workers fun to work with, nice facilities, and great work environment"
good,"Heartland offers a significant amount of things that may facilitate an employees life. Indoor gym to work out with a trainer and basketball court. Trainer is knowledgeable but there are clicks or groups and get treated accordingly. Gym has showers but they are often packed."
good,"In my particular position, there were new and unique challenges every day that kept my motivated and intrigued. Most sales employees work remotely, but the company has done a wonderful job at bringing everyone together and making it feel like one big family."
good,"NO base salary, very competitive market, customers typically skeptical of the merchant processing industry."
good,"Working for Heartland Payroll has been a experience of a life time.  I've worked for them for the pass 6 years and have enjoyed every moment of it.  I enjoy the clients the most, their the best people every."
good,This is a fantastic place to work with many opportunities to move around and explore your career path. The management team is a very difficult crowd to engage. Very hard to escalate any issues you may have.
good,"Good company to work for, not a lot of work for me to do.  Good people, good company, very stable.  If this were a full time position I think I would've loved it.  Typical day was mostly administrative functions such as answer the phone, filling out workman's comp paper work.  I have several small projects to complete while I was here.  None of them really took that long.  However you will learn a decent amount about HRIS while here."
good,"The company was great for along time , the managers they have   in the west coast not so good,"
good,"The building is beautiful. The campus is beautiful. There is state of the art gym with exercise classes. The atmosphere is young and filled with learning. It is a great place to learn as an intern, but they make it clear that they won't hire you if you are a beginner. The director of IT is really young, but very mature and supportive. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I could get there on any given day and learn something from experts, then go down the hall to lift weights!"
good,"It was good until our manager simply left the company and were left by ourselves. Everyone in payroll quit except myself and one other who had been here for several years. Finally, I decided to leave Heartland."
good,Great technology and go to market strategy. Division Manager position is a recruiting position.  Turnover is high. There is i genuine concern for success. Too many daily meetins can disrupt a daily plan.
good,"Multi-tasking is  a standard part of the culture. Time management is a must for the individual. Be careful of team leaders and department heads who are protective of their jobs and are easily intimidated by skills and talents of their team members. However, if you've got it,"
good,Credit card payment processing sales is a high burnout position. I had done it for 4 years.  It was time to make a change.   My portfolio was sold back for a profit.
good,"Solid work environment . Good people who know what they are doing. After merger, company restructured. Depending on the work you are qualified to do, there may be some GA jobs available but not in tax."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Heartland and was saddend when my position was eliminated.  The position gave me the opportunity to be self reliant and in control of my work day."
good,100% commission  you dont sell? you dont eat!  Its  a fast paced 100% commission job that sells credit card systems.  Because this industry is not really regulated it is very cut throat
good,"The culture of Heartland is top shelf. They take such good care of their people that their retention rate is outstanding.  "
good,"If you are really interested in jump starting your sales career, this is a great company. Lots of learning experience and skills to be gained as a Heartland rep."
good,"I enjoyed working for Heartland Payment Systems dba School Solution. Terrific executive management team, a sales team that is like a family. Compensation is fair, objectives are obtainable."
good,"Heartland is a great company to get started with.  You can learn sales, recruiting, HR, marketing, etc.  Growth is tough in the company and there are not clear pathways."
good,"Looks like a great way to create a business that you can set you're own goals and reach with good results,Endless success,Could be a very profitable job,Make you're own success in which you are in control of how good you wanna do.Could be a very good place to work,Sales and work ethic must be strong,Closing accounts!!!!"
good,"The people are top-notch, sometimes difficult to move up in the organization, but overall a great place to work. Company not adverse to change or new technologies. The environment is sometimes challenging, but always manageable."
good,"Good people doing a hard job and really great work area."
good,Then one month in my department got told we were getting laid off. We had one month to find new jobs. And out supervisor was let go a week after hiring us due to HR issues.
good,Heartland Payment Systems was a very good company to work for and treated their customers and employees very well until they went public with their stock. It all went down hill from there.They eventually had to sell out to anther company
good,"Great place to work if your self driven, enjoy chasing and closing deals. This is not a 9-5 type company, you determine your schedule, plan your income generating strategy and execute. Can be lucrative if you're hungry and persistent."
good,Good company to work for. Don't make a mistake because it could lead to termination quickly if you have a certain type of manager. HR doesn't govern the decision making at Heartland.
good,Heartland has a great open culture that is relaxed and friendly. Management has recently changes to wall street guys and they are making changes to cut costs.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and direct managers.  The work is flexible and understanding to life outside work.  You have the ability to work from home when needed.  The company is continuing to grow, and with that comes growing pains.  Managers being forced out, wasted money on useless software, and ever changing methodology."
good,"The co-workers are great. A family type of atmosphere.  "
good,A beautiful campus with a lot of onsite perks. The employees were really friendly and willing to help when needed. The work there is challenging but also rewarding. I enjoyed going to work each and every day!
good,It’s been a great working experience and great working environment for people willing learn.  The most I like about the job is that the hours are flexible and all workers are friendly.
good,"Dynamic working environment, technologies, management, corporate culture, and initiatives.  "
good,Great culture.  Amazing boss.  Just no base salary.  one bad month in the B2B world can throw you off and problems seem to compound and become too stressful without a base salary.
good,An Industry leader.  Lots of opportunity.  Great employees.  Room for advancement.  Good working environment.  Great location.  Good positive management.
good,"Heartland is a very strong sales organization. You need to be able to work with out any direction, self starers only. "
good,"Provides support to 35,000 K-12 schools in their cafeteria operations, nutrition, and USDA compliance.  The people are great.  They have a sincere desire to serve the customer and will do whatever it takes to get the job done.  Management is remotely located at other locations.  They have had a lot of turmoil going through multiple acquisitions.  In the last year alone I reported to three upper management managers."
good,A typical day involved attending the various meetings between the Scrum groups and coordinating work items for the typical sprint releases with many of the groups being accommodating to questions and giving helpful advice on the systems and payment industry.
good,People are great. Not much long term thinking - lot's of reactive work - not proactive (i.e. - seeing an issue and putting a band-aid on it versus a long-term solution). Being acquired.
good,"Work is great, awesome co-workers & staff are good my fav. Thing about the job is helping my clients. The clients is why I love to come to owrk,"
good,My employment at Heartland has been favorable overall. It has been a great place to learn and grow and management makes sure you have the training to get the job done. There is a great sense of teamwork which is great. Very nice people to work with.
good,"Heartland is a wonderful place to work.  I've learned so much about the payroll processing industry and worked with many interesting and hard-working people.  Management can be very understanding and flexible when family emergencies arise.  The hardest part of my job is making difficult clients happy, which is difficult anywhere you work.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making the clients happy, giving them the Plus One service that they may not be used to with other Payroll Companies."
good,"Strong, fast paced place to work. Laid back environment. Stays on top of technology. Good leadership."
good,The work environment and objectives have given me the opportunity to refines my people skills and have a better approach to addressing concerns and requirements of the clients and their customers.
good,I have enjoyed working at Heartland for the past few years providing local businesses with Payroll Services and ancillary programs represented by the Parent Company.
good,Excellent place for work due to a great life balance environment. So far the products and service are beneficial for its customers. The know their target audience and accommodate they services to their needs.
good,Heartland is a great place to work. They are very employee focused and provide excellent benefits. including paid tuition for a Business Degree. They have an on- site gym and daycare facility as well as an on-site cafeteria.
good,"Food kitchen to eat breakfast and lunch, basketball court, fitness center, day care, ping pong tables. Family oriented company, great management, onsite college courses."
good,"While I only spent a year at Heartland, I was rather impressed with may aspects of their business. The Training Department did a wonderful job teaching everyone the ropes. The Supervisors were all friendly and welcoming. They never made you feel like any question was dumb. the coworkers were equally as helpful."
good,Good not ask for a better company. n nnn nn nn nnn nnn nn nnn nnk kkk. kk kkk kkkk kkkk kkkk kkk kkkk kkkk kkk kk kk kkkk kkkkk k kk kkk gjg jgjg jgjg jjgjg jgjjg.
good,A typical day would be to determine who to call to schedule Face Time Appointments for the week.  What I learned was Heartland has a method to their madness that really does work.  The management is great - I received much support.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to book appointments on a consistent basis.
good,"Good support system.  Knowledgeable staff.  Repetitive job, but always busy.  Days go by fast.  Constant learning through training.  Not a hard job; will teach all you need to know."
good,"Good ethical company to work for. Your earning potential is tied to your desire to be successful. Company is under new ownership, so I've heard it's not as desirable to work there as the culture has changed."
good,great job for that season of my life. Unable to be flexible with my school schedule and too stressful to maintain while going to school. Very much enjoyed my time there.
good,great austin area management.  the company has great technology that makes sales very easy. easy sales job with great compensation
good,Great agile work environment and team collaboration. Team members are great to work with and encourage skill development. No cubicles; Open space environment
good,"Enjoyed working in a state of the art facility. Management was great and the company as a whole was a great. i enjoyed working a supervisor , i was able to lead a team of 20 co-workers whom they shared their talent, skills and their passion."
good,"Provide support of production systems and transmit multi-million dollar production files to associations like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Key Bank, Heartland Bank, and Wells Fargo."
good,"I have enjoyed working here, and coworkers have been mostly easy to work with."
good,"Get up 6:30AM to organize cold calls and follow up existing leads."
good,"This is a great company to work for, was able to meet new people everyday."
good,"Heartland Payment systems is a great place to work with great benefits. Offering free personal trainers, HSA cards for medical use and a wonderful atmosphere. My only reason for wanting to leave is for an opportunity to get back into management and IT."
good,"loved working with people and getting them through there problems. enjoyed making connectionwith with the companies that we worked with and doing a good job with the customers. if my co-works had issues or problems i took pride that i would be able to help them from my experiences and notes. the hardest part was when couldn't get the equipment up and it had to go to the second level, cause that would mean that the customers could be down and i have been on their side of issues and understand."
good,"This is a good company to work for. They are totally in-line with looking out for the best interest of their employees. This was my first corporate ""gig"" and I have been impressed how personal everyone is. I thought this would be a cold corporate environment but I have been more than pleasantly surprised about how everyone treats each other and I have made a number of life-long friendships. A great place to advance your career.  Don't get me wrong, credit card processing is a tough industry due to the stress of interacting with merchants sometimes when you are dealing with their money so do some research about that aspect of running a business because being on the other end is stressful but then again I was in the retention department."
good,Heartland is a great company overall. I remember getting paid my first week in training and it was a total surprise! I had no idea I was going receive anything. Management is great and really understands the importance of work/life balance. You will have everything you need to succeed. A lot of your success will depend on your network and  hard work.
good,"There are a lot of different opportunities for different positions that come open. Growth with in the company is encouraged. Great benefits, on site gym, cafe, and child care."
good,Heartland payment systems is an excellent place to work. Their training is pneaumonal. The best I've ever been through. Job security is very high and the working environment is very pleasant and team oriented
good,"I've been at Heartland for two years now. This is a great opportunity to earn what you are worth. If you have self discipline and an entrepreneurial spirit, this might be for you. If you are looking for a job to kick back, work a few hours, avoid your boss, and collect a salary, this IS NOT FOR YOU. "
good,"This company is frequently breaking ground in new industries.  Top level management is excellent.  "
good,"Great company to work for, own hours, self-discipline a must, excellent sales compensation and portfolio package.  Could not come to terms with Managment."
good,"A typical day was to research existing accounts I could visit to do account reviews, find their pains and offer additional products. In between I installed or reprogrammed credit card machines to set up new accounts. Co-workers were all great. Hardest part of the job is getting up and running, you have to learn the credit card business and how to fix/program all different types of machines. I loved working from my house and car. You have to be available all the time incase someoones machine goes down, you need to go to the customer site and fix it if customer service can't help over the phone."
good,"I really loved my time at heartland."
good,Great Place to work. Great people. Good Income. I was in sales with a ton of flexibility and plenty of room to grow.  Great work life balance made it easy to be here. My direct report was the best and the VP was great as well.
good,"The company does care about its people. The work can be stressful and it is hard to move beyond middle management. The building has everything you need. The benefits package is good and your starting PTO is better than anywhere else you can go. It’s hard to find decent hours at first, but after about a year you should be able to hit a sweet shift. The major plus is the company pays for shift differential right after training."
good,Very good environment to enhance our skills under supporting management.
good,"You give this company all you have and in return, it will give you the same."
good,Heartland Payment Systems is one of the best companies I have worked for in the credit card processing industry.  The industry itself is very difficult and it is not for everyone.  Some people can really thrive here and make a lot of money.  Other people just can't make it work.  There is a lot of competition in this industry because you can make a lot of money.  Heartland treats you fairly and really pushes you to succeed. Their health insurance is fantastic and their residual program is really solid to.  They are transparent and won't lie to you about numbers. However if you have never sold in the credit card industry before be careful. It is probably one of the most difficult industries to sell in right now because of the constant competition.
good,"I traveled over 3 hours a day to and from work, if it was not for my distance this would be an ideal job. The people who work for this company are amazing, and a fun bunch to spend your days with in the battles of payroll."
good,"They will train you, assist and support you all the time, and you will get to learn new skills every day. Sometimes you may feel the job is long and stressful, however, you need to develop the skills needed to help you manage your time and improve your communication skills."
good,"A great company to work for!  You are free to grow as big as you want! The only thing holding you back is ""yourself""!  Management has a very good training program!"
good,"This is a great place to work. Unfortunately, the company is relocating to Tennessee."
good,Good place to work. I have grown as a human. Learn many valuable life lessons there as well. My best review would have to say the job sustained my lifestyle and I am grateful to have worked for such a fantastic group of people.
good,"Excellent company to work for, nice requirements, rules to follow and good coworkers to work with and for."
good,I enjoy working here. Not so fond of the customer support profession anymore. The job can be very tiresome and draining just by putting up with the number of calls that enter into the call center daily.
good,"The people that work here are great to work with. But as with all fast growing companies, there are many inconsistencies and hurdles with organizational structures that may act as barriers. Overall, the administrative functions are young in their maturity, but they seem to be improving at a fast pace."
good,A typical day was to make 30-50 cold calls and secure appointments.  I learned all about credit card processing and the laws that clients must adhere to.  The hardest part of the job was....there really wasn't one.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my clients to understand the ins & outs of card processing and how I could help them.

good,Heartland has great leadership and a wonderful training program.  It is a very difficult industry to start up in without experience.
good,"Much of my work was new to me as I worked out of my house, making 20 -30 cold calls a days on business' to set up appointments. One of my strengths is building relationships with customers and fellow employees. I have limited time with the customer which cuts into my relationship time. A typical day was 12 hours with calls late at night occasionally. The overall view the Company holds is one of integrity and transparency in all of our transactions."
good,"Heartland has been a great company to work for. Good management and perks.They have a great atmosphere and offer many amenities including on site gym, cafeteria and day care."

good,Enjoyed working for Heartland Payment Systems especially in my last position.  Working as a Loss Prevention Analyst really showed me a different avenue of credit card processing and I enjoyed working 3rd shift.

It has been a great place to grow. I went looking for a new job and found my career. Wonderful people to work for and great benefits.

good,I’m an employee at HPS for the last year.  It’s a great place to build a career.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.   No caps on income.  Culture is fantastic.  No micro management.  It is a 100% commission position that allows a person to own their own business.  Tons of support and the client base as a whole is satisfied with the services.
good,Heartland Payment Systems is a great place to work. It is a company that promotes a strong culture in a self motivated environment.
good,"Heartland is a wonderful company to work for. The training is incredibly detailed and gives you more than enough knowledge and tools for how to handle your calls once you begin on the call center floor. A normal day is very busy, between intaking 80 plus calls per day you are also assigned other areas to work on when calls queues are empty, such as underwriting, closing accounts, answering emails, or sending scanned faxed documents to correct departments, etc. Team leaders and managers are very easy to approach and ask for help when needed, and always willing to help in any way possible. Co-workers/team members are right there to help in a moments notice, if someone is not on a call they tend to keep an ear out for someone near by who may be needing help and will quickly jump to action to help out. When you walk away from Heartland at the end of the day, you tend to walk away with many new friends that feel more like a family. The hardest part of the job would just be having to memorize all the different types of machines they use and how to work each one when giving technical support to merchants calling in. I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of the job is the merchants and sales representatives that you deal with who become more like friends, they will call in and want to deal with you specifically and ask for you if they get someone else. They form relationships with us and over time get to know us personally and genuinely care."
good,Great fair company.... But... You've got to hustle and close deals. Pay is exceptional. The residual pay is a great bonus. Great benefits. Competitive atmosphere.
good,"Been at Heartland over 5 years, and this environment has been the best one for me so far.  Great manager, awesome/knowledgeable team lead - I've been fortunate to work in a group where the culture is caring of it's people, work-life balance is above satisfactory.  My only complaint is the recent shift in ownership to Global.  They utilize outsourcing in their business model.  I have not had good experiences with outsourcing - but will wait and see how that pans out."
good,Heartland is a great company with lots of great people. I had a variety of Interesting projects to work on and every one was busy with numerous projects.
good,"Top leadership at Heartland values customer care, respect, collaboration, and communication, while at the same time prioritizing hard work and being a financial tech leader.

good,Great company with a focus on positive work environment and employee culture. Must be able to work alone and as part of a team. I highly recommend this company.
good,"Heartland changed my life! I hope one day I will be able to become a hired on employee for a full time position. Being an only temporary employee was not long enough. But again, like I said, this has by far been the best job I have ever had!"
good,"If you're a winner, look no further. This comp structure is INSANE! You get paid weekly for new business sold, and RESIDUAL for life on your accounts.

The culture here in Arizona has been transformed into a new powerhouse!"

good,"I was hired on as a temp for their seasonal position and received some of the greatest classroom training before being released onto the phones. The floor coaches are always willing and eager to assist with any problem and do so in the most professional manner. I was offered employment with them in a different department after only 2 months of being with them, but do to personal issues I did not accept. I STILL regret the decision to this day!"

good,"This was a wonderful facility. We worked receiving calls from retailers and consumers. The consumers were calling regarding their return activity report, and the retailers were calling to edit certain information or receive technicall support assistance with their terminals or new employees. This job was not challenging in that particular department. The most challenging thing people warned about this department was constantly dealing with angry, irate consumers but I found that was not difficult and as long as you maintained a calm professional demeanor things were quickly resolved."
