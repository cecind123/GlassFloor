good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
bad,"If you're an owner operator, DO NOT LEASE with HubGroup from the Austell, GA terminal. I was told from the terminal manager that the company gives work to their company drivers first then owner operators. Therefore, owner operators have limited work. They only give one or two jobs at a time then ask for more work. It takes them hours to respond to your request which leaves you with limited hours left to run any loads. Also the terminal manager said this terminal hired too many company drivers and owner operators, so work is very slow Tuesday thru Friday.  Therefore, the pay isn't good either. Their rates are LOW! They only pay you $1.10 per mile, if you drive more than 100 miles, and the rate is less if you drive less than 100 miles. Regional drivers get paid more than local drivers due to mileage but once you pay for gas, you're left with half of your check. The company only gives you back $0.22 per mile for gas. And all loads do not pay the same. I had jobs that paid $99 for a load and then $47 for another with the same mileage. It is very hard to predict how much you will take home weekly. Owner operators cannot sustain with this company. Atlanta traffic is absolutely horrible so the best time to work is early morning but the problem is most drivers want that shift too. "
bad,When I started working here they paid hourly everything was good until they changed our pay to mileage. Once they changed 30 drivers left dispatchers began to show favoritism and a lot of loads were Fort Worth Dallas and back. You’ll be lucky to get 200 miles a day but you’ll surely get 6 to 8 stops and wait at each stop with no pay and they take their time unloading. They promise to pay 1250 a week but a lot of do not even get 250 a day they want you to work 6 days so yes it messes with you life style you’ll be too tired to do anything out of work.
bad,I would not recommend working for Hub Group Dedicated. They only care about how much money they can put in their pockets and don't care about employees. No one from HR or payroll will ever answer a call or call you back. I would avoid at all cost.
bad,"I got a job offer, I took it. On the first day of orientation I realized the pay advertised was not the actual pay offered. They apologized by saying it was a typo after I showed them their recruiters email. "
bad,"I didn't work there long enough to give a valid review. When my contract ended, the company was going through a re-org. I have absolutely no idea what is happening at the Hub Group today."
bad,"This place is the equivalent of fecal wrapped in gift paper...seems all nice and pretty at first glance but once you get in there its just a sshow. Managers are either rude, incompetent, not leaders or a combination of all three. They thrive on cut throat, borderline unethical booking practices and exploitation of unsuspecting contractors. They dangle the carrot of high income potential, solid benefits and perks to get them through busy season then cut a good majority of contractors once they are no longer needed or perceived as a threat to management. There is not a lot of room for advancement  and a majority of the high earners are capped out unless you are a carrier rep. Again they provide the addition perks like the occasional lunch, coffee, swag and company parties during the holidays but only as a means of keeping their employees and contractors drinking the ""Kool-aid"". "
bad,If you like getting completely filthy every day and working tons of hours then this is the job for . Really long days really close to your 70 hour clock every week and barely breaking a 1000 bucks wow what a joke.
bad,They're cutting back hours and overtime. The managers don't even know how to drive a truck yet they're sleeping their way to the top. Everybody knows that management does nothing but stab all the truck drivers in the back and they could care less about how they are treated
bad,"Terrible management, poor communication and the company sends employees home and doesnt allownthem to get the hours as promised when hired and if they choose to will not allow employees to work their full schedule. Worst company ever."
bad,"Hub Dedicated is not organized well. There isnt room for advancement. "
bad,Poor communication between corporate and management and drivers terrible safety program but they do take care of their trucks starting newer drivers Atmore then the older drivers
bad,Over work you could be more organized with daily deliveries and more organized with routing and they need to offer better time off and sick time poor turn over rate
bad,They have drive Cam cameras in the truck it's like having Big Brother watch you for 12 hours A-day  The pay is below average  they  require you to have  hazardous  Material indorsement And do not pay you extra to have it To me it feels like Like that atmosphere in the culture is against the driver and they need to change that So basically the company is a stepping stone company come and make your money and get out herethemaktheymoyomoney and get out
bad,"no leadership poor communication company did,nt take time to listen to the drivers equipment not satisfactory not provided with the correct log books no break room"
bad,Hub group dispatch don’t communicate and never want you to go home just sit in the truck and wait hours for a load not a driver friendly place only the favorites make money
bad,"Just where to being. Short the stock. If you want to make money, don’t even think of trying to make money on your options. You won’t you never will. I"
bad,"You are micro managed and are given very little autonomy in your day to day work life.  Top executives are related to the CEO, and continue to keep promotions within the family.  The most enjoyable part was getting Panera every Friday."
bad,"this company talk a good game to get you hired, the management is horrible they do all they can do to get you a short paycheck, they do not put in all your moves that you have to do on a daily bases for them. they do not have enough empty trailers to service the atlanta area which makes you run btter than half your day looking for a empty trailer, God help you at the railyard I've been at that railyard sometimes for 4hrs in a day and they still expect you to do your run that's better than 4hrs out not thicking about that you slip seat trucks with other drivers"
bad,"The company numbers are down, they consistently promise promotions then never follow up, people quit left and right, and they simply take advantage of their employees."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
bad,They take advantage of drivers fail to pay what they promise recruiters lie continuously about pay fail to give you correct info .onboarding have no clue and you may end up paying your hotel stays
bad,"This is the most worst place I have ever worked for as a driver. The management is absolutely clueless I don't see how they stay in business, the Atlanta office is full of the most rude and obnoxious dispatchers and the environment is horrible. DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING THE RECRUITER TELLS YOU!!!. This is a horrible place to work."
bad,PLEASE don't make the same stupid mistake I did.Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away from this HELLHOLE!!! Worst company I have EVER worked for!The management is so unorganized and unprofessional it's the worst I have ever seen!Recruiter lies to you and tells you this a local position home every day and you will make the equivalent of 22 dollars and hour.lol..LIES!!! They only pay you 10-12 dollars an hour and .21 cent a mile.O and it's not home every day..management will purposely give you loads that are impossible to turn knowing your in a day cab resulting in you renting a hotel. Sometimes when you come to work when your suppose to they don't even have work to give you. And they have the audacity to get mad at you when you voice your frustration to them.lol.The only way you will ever see decent money at this bulls*%t place is if you run your clock out every single day with a run that takes all day to do.THey never answer their phone and never respond to anything you write on the Qualcomm.This company is the absolute WORST!!!
bad,"This is by far the worst company to work for, u barely get loads,the recruiters lie and tell u that u get paid $20 an hour,but it's really $10 for day shift and $12 night shift. The driver managers don't care about you, they lie to you every time you go to them with a problem. Their is no communication,somedays u come to work and they never give u a load,which means no pay for the day,I can't think of one good thing to say about this company, I wish I had done my research before coming to this company."
bad,"I'm not exactly sure where to start.  "
bad,I don't call it fun  they will send you out  not far  some other people they give long run s.   I got tired of getting short runs. I could not pay my bills so I left
bad,Very high turnover along with a lot of surprise layoffs at different locations which shows with all the positions that are open. Job advancement is taking a different position with a paycut. Company has lost alot of 10+ year employees who went elsewhere.
bad,The absolute worst place to work as a company driver. If you are owner operator things are a little better for awhile until you turn down a route you can't do for that day. The management is unwilling to give a home/work balance. You are NOTHING BUT A NUMBER at this company. The company is silently split between the management and the drivers! Turnover ratio high do to employees not being treated as human beings. Good luck with being happy with this company.
bad,sever lack of communication between management and employees especially during the company having new ownership and its restructuring period there was no sense of loyalty.
bad,Hub Group has been making changes without actual plans. They're also creating a toxic work environment and losing more talent with every passing day. Management doesn't communicate and is a complete joke.
bad,No appreciation shown to employees. Supervisors salary is a joke. Mandatory OT. Unprofessional environment. Would not work here again.
bad,Work environment is toxic from the top down.  Management is a joke and are involved in some of the shadiest dealings going on here.  You can’t trust anyone everyone seem to have a chip on their shoulder.  Terrible work environment.
bad,"Low pay, hardly any miles. You average 500- 600 paycheck. Poor management and people skills need some work. Management doesn’t care about drivers or drivers needs"
bad,"Hourly start pay is $10.50/hr plus productivity pay which varies.  Can you live off the hourly pay plus “varies?” You will do 10 plus hours a day driving around Atlanta GA and maybe out of town (miles equal productivity pay). Slip seating everyday with newer equipment.   Management is poor and severely over worked.  All of this is why the sign on bonus is so high. Think twice Driver "
bad,This company operates like a plantation. They do not understand Logistics. They give out most of their work two other carriers first. Then they give work 2 The Hub Group drivers. You your schedule is not pre-planned and most of the times you will have to wait for them to find you something to do.
bad,If you can work anywhere else I suggest you do so . Buy far the worst job I have ever had regret working here driver faceing cameras write you up for everything changes your schedule in the blink of a eye and expect you to come in whenever they ask you  65 mph trucks all automatic trucks
bad,This is for a driver who has no family you work long hours a day somewhere in the 13 to 16 ballpark. management sucks and you have no way of moving up in the company.
bad,Hub group offers a good compensation package but a poor work environment.  Favoritism is a way of life which makes it difficult to reach your maximum earning potential.
bad,"Hope to get a run that you could provide for your family & keep your truck running.Lowest pay i have every had as a owner operator.Management not very truthful with drivers,co-workers were awesome,hardest part of job was coming to work for peanuts,most enjoyable part was leaving."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
bad,"This is the worst place ever.  Pay is always wrong, layovers are the regular, rude staff, inconsiderate management, dysfunctional and unorganized.  Promises, promises, promises, and nothing.  No raise is years.  High driver turnover rate and almost as high on the inside.  The whole company is the same but Atlanta, GA is the worst.  RUN!!!"
bad,If you are an IT professional and value your career stay from the Hub group. There is a reason why Hub Group is constantly looking for IT help because it’s a giant revolving door. In other words the Hub group treats IT professionals like garbage.Trust me I know as the Hub group was the WORST IT experience I ever went through. Stay away from this place at all costs unless you’re that hard up for work and definitely don’t leave your current job for the Hub Group...you'll be sorry.
bad,Not a good company to work for. Management is rude. They don’t care about their employees. You’re just a number to then and sometimes not even that! They tell you what you want to hear to get you working there but then everything turns out to be a lie. If your pay check gets shorted it takes them months to rectify the situation! STAY AWAY!!!!!
bad,Pay should be a lot more and organization skills need to be fix as well. Can spend most of your time  looking for empties because dispatch doesn't know where they're located at and once you get to work you're waiting for hours to get in a truck or get a load if you're not preplaned
bad,You will have to work a lot of hours just to see a decent check! Sometimes they will  have you doing yard pulls and there’s no way you can make money!
bad,"I don't even know where to begin - Terrible management putting  constant pressure on employees to work well over 8 hours a day. Middle management strongly discouraged taking lunch breaks... some were told they couldn't even have longer than 30 minutes for a lunch; absolutely crazy. Employee's are expected to work multiple Saturdays out of the month if there isn't enough coverage.. which once again is absolutely crazy."
bad,"Company management lost the contract at Walmart Monroe and because of that I am missing money on my lats Paycheck since Dec 30th Payroll Department haven't care about it and haven't even return my phone calls or reply my emails with all the proof that I have, since Hub lost the account managers on site pass their responsibility to payroll and not helping the drivers to resolve there issues also the company did not pay me my last holiday Dec 25th. Poor business Management from this company STAY AWAY FROM HUB."
bad,There was pay issues for vacation time not getting paid for vacation unroll a edmonth later. Other pay roll issues and pay was all ways up and down never make the money I wanted.
bad,"Being Owner Operator in Harrisburg, I experienced Very poor management,Zero Communication skills, and Lots of lies, Staff will never answer the phone or reply you in half hour. Rates are so low for owner operator , So they get richer for themselves. Environment in Harrisburg very stressful, you will not see anybody smiling and they will only know you by Your truck number and Act like they are the only place. But that’s why they lost lots of people and they are downsizing."
bad,Management does not desire for individuals to learn new skills.  I requested to learn the functions of other departments to better assist the company and was denied.
bad,"Worst company to work owners operators be aware!!!! Not a good company to work for bad paid,50 % live load no pay any extra for live load same pay like drop off very bad experience in Indianapolis IN."
bad,"I've only been here a short time, but I will say that I've seen a lot of change in the last year, and that is certainly concerning ....specifically, several changes in executive leadership positions."
bad,"very Busy place in Monroe. Very unorganized. No appreciation. Lucky if you can get a break. "
bad,"Poor management, no training. I had to ask for training.Their idea of training is to have you sit next to different people throughout the day without step by step instructions as to what you are suppose to do."
bad,"They don't promote company drivers unless they have a bachelor degree in lips planted firmly on the upper managements behind, even then never. While they push most for 14 hour days they allow others or their lip locking pets to milk the clock while hiding around the yard, then expect the freight that's late to be covered by the ones who run their tails off. The management also likes to attach dirogitory nicknames about their drivers and snicker behind their backs, NO RESPECT while piling on extra runs to the point their forced into a layover, then the day starts over till your working 70 hrs in 5 or 6 days...always tired, and can barely keep home in sight. Other then that a truly great job for the best butt kissers, in fact real gravey!"
bad,I would not recommend any HR processional work here.  The company leadership does not value HR as a true partner and they won't until leadership changes.
bad,The recruiter are a bunch of liars they will tell u anything to get u in the door they have management that never been in a truck  site managers that have a screw loose  first company I had to work thanksgiving day they are full of it they base your safety bonus off the drive cam they have the drive cam set  up to screw you  can’t wait to leave this company talked to others drivers that been here 11years only making 21.90 a hour think about that 11years of service
bad,"Worked as a contractor. the money was good until they  started leasing trucks from Pensky and have their own company drivers. "
bad,"The pay is a joke, your told youll be paid a great amount from the recruiters and its all a lie. Office positions are not offered to drivers no matter how long you work there."
bad,They tell you what to go pay you do you turn around and took the money back from you  I’ve been working in Huber for six years and is the most money of me but since I’m not on your Walmart account anymore I’m back to making llow wages
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
bad,I’ve had a terrible experience at my specific branch I also work at a different branch in a different state wasn’t so bad but don’t risk it there are far better options out there
bad,"Hub is known as a place where if you have talent and ideas, and you Express them, you can expect a short tenure.  The best minds that I knew at Hub were all let go because they didnt match what the ownership thought.  Too bad as it could be a very good company.  Lots and lots of nepotism at Hub at the highest levels which causes all sorts of issues for employees to speak up."
bad,"As an inventory manager there I was moving inventory from one place to another. Very boring work and everyday was the same thing over and over. "
bad,Was told when I was hired that I would only be working 10 hours per day but was routinely working 12-16 hours. Their trailer equipment has something wrong with it 90% of the time and sometimes take forever to respond to requests for assistance.
bad,"I’m a company driver. Do not believe the pay scale. You will not make 70,000.00 plus. The pay scale will add up to around 16 to 17 dollars an hour. And you will work mostly 12/14 hrs. Daily. You will set in the docks with a live load for hours, then be told to deliver to the rail yards in Chicago without a safe amount of HOS. The Fleet is old and wore out with constant break downs. The Indianapolis yard is a giant mud hole or covered with ice. Bring your tools because everyday is a struggle for a legal DOT trailer and be ready to repair rail yard chassises daily."
bad,Went from local driving at 20 per hr to local at .77 per mile. Now I make half of what I was making . Time to start looking for a better paying job......
bad,"I feel that management favors only certain types of individuals. There are no minorities in upper management if this reflects in the day to day culture of the entire company environment, The professionalism at certain locations does not exist."
bad,"Hub likes to give the appearance as if it's a fun and progressive place to work, but that's far from the truth. The culture is stuffy and everyone does whatever it takes to stay out of management's way. The level of nepotism is out of this world. The CEO's sons are known to have bad tempers and everyone tries to stay on their good sides to avoid getting axed. Few women and no minorities in any real position of power. Overall not a place for serious people looking for a long term career."
bad,"I worked for Hub Group Highway Division Toledo for 6 months. At first it seemed like a great place to work and the hours were good but that was during the peak season. Once things slowed down it went down hill. They moved me departments claiming corporate downsizing had reduced the amount of space available in the department I was in so to continue working there I had to move. I moved under the verbal conditions that I would be transferred back once things picked back up. That never happened. I get a call from my Aerotek Rep asking me me if I knew any other people who wanted to work in the department I got moved from because they had a bunch of openings. That should have been a major red flag. The manager at i the department i got moved to got promoted and another manager to over. This manager said they heard good things and it was recommended I got hired in. A couple months later things slow down again and all a sudden I'm being told I not doing anything right and they were letting me go, no warning, no corrective action or anything and they even had me train my replacement! My co-workers were great it's just a shame a couple poor managers lying to and screwing over their employees ruin what a good workplace it could be. My recommendation, get your training, get your money and then GET OUT!!!"
bad,"2 years ago Hub group did a mass hire with taking on several High profile customers and in doing so they were not staffed to ""correctly handle the flux of employees or business, they brought in a consulting company to help with this matter and in doing so they began firing long time employees and hiring fry cooks to be sales reps at bottom dollar wages"
bad,"Could be better, with loads an planning loads, update trucks an more work  but is a great place if you want to be home but the money is not great. was there for 5 years an i had a great time because i knew what to do, if you get on anyone bad side then your done they will cut your pay.."
bad,"this place is laughable the turn over rare is very high please dont waste your time,they will tell you that you annually pay is seventy thousands and it is not even close to the truth,"
bad,To have to sit  in my Truck for Hours waiting for work is not good.will never come back to work with this company.i Will not recommend it Will make you go broke.really broke...
bad,"I am an owner operator based out of Harrisburg PA.I am going on my sixth year there. I am leaving shortly. The only reason I stayed as long is I did was to get home for my children's athletic events. Before they started dispatching out of Chicago it was not too bad. There is a lot of nepotism within the company. I know of two drivers that they pay a $150.00 ""empty move"" to every day. This costs Hub group $6,000.00 dollars a month. While a lot of times I find myself having to drive for free back and forth to Harrisburg to start work, because they don't have any loads going my way.  The driver managers are cranky all the time...rude. The load planners in Chicago have no clue how to plan. Pretty sure they have no idea what a map looks like or now how to use map quest. The turn over is incredible. 500 hundred new drivers since I started there. Hub group would rather keep paying $5,000.00 sign on bonuses to new drivers, rather than keeping the current drivers happy. They say there is all kinds of freight. At least twice a week they only have one load for me to deliver. Ever since comtraks logistics was bought out by Hub group things have slowly gone down hill. I would say they have hit rock bottom at this point."
bad,"I have no idea where to start. Remarkably i'm not upset, yet i'm highly disappointed in what this company has turned into. There use to be company wide appreciation for the drivers.. Now you are literally a number. Clock in and out system is a little weary seeing that you have to use either a mobile device or computer to do so. Company is not flexible when it comes to life outside of them. The pay is deplorable as a truck driver with experience. Seriously it's laughable. DM company wide could be better. There is a ton of miscommunication. Lots of stipulations to follow, but the dividends don't add up. You have to be a secretary, driver, DM, and a human being all while trying to feed your family off of nickels and dimes. Base pay is $10 even for experienced drivers when the base pay should be $17-20. And please don't have the nerve to have a life outside of work..... On a scale of 1-10 i give the company a 4."
bad,No solid training and too many managers led to many days of uncertainty about the stability of the job and position held.  Favoritism was obvious and those that were in that group were those that had the opportunities for promotions.  No build up of employees but plenty of tearing down. Overworked and made to feel that you must work past the time that you got off to finish even though there was no overtime or comp time.  Not an enjoyable place to work.  But I did like bagel Fridays.  Thanks HUB Group.
bad,Went from making $20 an hour which is decent to 77 cents a mile and $15 per stop.  If you want to make some money this is not the place. 🤯😤😤.......
bad,Hub use to be a driver friendly company however as of late it is now not favorable to the driver I work at the Atlanta terminal and the turnover has been enormous as of late they got rid of driver friendly management and now new terminal manager has fired or simply intimidated drivers to quit he is not very well liked at all but the company itself is not bad I am speaking of the terminal I work out of I don’t view working here as a pleasant experience anymore
bad,"Grew up with a simple philosophy. If you got nothing nice to say, don't say anything."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
bad,not a set schdual have to wait for a truck some days they promise you a sign on bonus and have to fight to get the second part of it keep an eye on your paycheck they short you management is not that good
bad,This place was taken over by Hub a year ago.  The communication is not there nor is the culture.  I feel they are extremely unorganized as a large company.
bad,New management came in with new terminal screwed everything up. Hardest part of the job was dealing with poor equipment and very bad training. Most enjoyable part of the job was the commute to and from work.
bad,Immediate management was easy to work with.  They did change their bonus structure regularly and always make the changes retroactive.  The bonus structure was their biggest selling point in the interview process.
bad,Too many management changes.  People fired on a regular basis.
bad,The railyard and safety is the most aggravating part of your day. Chassis are a hit and miss since Hub dont own them. The camera in truck wouldnt be so bad but safety is beyond overwhelming. You will be documented for any and everything as if road conditions and situations dont constantly change. Anything they deem unsafe and you will be put out of service under investigation.
bad,Hope group has poor management no room for advancement and no matter how hard you work you're never recognized. I was there for four years never messed up but one day I dropped the ball and forgot to report missing my flop and the next day they pulled me in the office told me I was fired.
bad,"Hub Group is a good place to start out!  A Six day week pay check at hub, is Five days at other companies. 14 hours everyday. Four to six loads, plus two -four empty trailers a day. Fuel reimbursement is at 16%.  And that's 16% multiplied, by your wkly. salary. Over charge on insurance, plates, and IFTA. Loads are heavy 70% of the time Its, also a Two strikes and your out company.  Poor communication, through out the company! New load planner every Six months. Other carries make more money on the same loads. For instance, Hub Drivers  make 541 to drop a load@ Smyrna, the take empty trailer to hurlock And bring back a load. So, 541x.16%=627.56!  Other carriers makes 350+450=$800, on the same run! Go figure!"
bad,The position was good but the the way you work is depending on what loads were available where you can make good money but this wasn't the case.For example: what I was paid couldn't buy a postal stamp.
bad,"Had to almost make a movie of every truck you get in to prevent, a false damage charge, units are slip seat so some are very nasty in the inside.  The driver is responsible of cleaning the unit.  On the weekend mechanics are not on hand.  So any repair that can be done by the driver is up to the driver or he has to wait until the next driver come in with a road ready truck."
bad,"Culture is stuffy, raises are minimal.  Not much room for advancement unless you are in the clique.  Lack of mutual respect between upper management and employees."
bad,Demanding job. Sometimes round the clock 24/7. Strict company guidelines to maintain employment.
bad,Slip seating is a job killer and a waste of valuable time . I would not recommend this to anyone. They need to assign each driver to his own truck to be used daily
bad,"I don’t recommend working here if you want to actually get paid for what your responsibilities entail. Management will try to suck the life out of you by working you to death. Constantly adding responsibility and extra tasks to take on (handling various reports or being in charge of them for your team) without being compensated for the add-on’s. You are expected to work 2 holidays a year out of the 8 that hub group recognizes. If you work in operations, be prepared to be ridiculed and be dehumanized from other departments (account management specifically). The carriers that hub group have totally suck and hub Group trucking is extremely difficult to deal with. If you can, stay away from this company. There’s much better companies out there that will pay you fairly."
bad,The job is ok for someone who doesn't pay attention to the sneakiness that the company does on a regular. You do a lot of paperwork and computer stuff for your pay check but if you don't pay attention they cheat you out of money. They run game on you about no loads or short loads that's because they have to give so many loads to another company that they have a contract with. Always trying to get freebies off you by giving you a load then on your way back pickup another load which your not being paid for. It's laid back but not too concerned about you getting paid just take what they want to give you and they're ok with you.
bad,Just got hired on to this company. Moved 4 hours away from home and took a chance three months ago. Just found out our contract expired so alot of drivers are going to be let go if there are no more spots with the company open
good,Those in mid to upper roles only see you as a cog and not as an individual. They all have their own agendas which always put you in the middle of every department raging war against each other
good,"Year and a half ago, management changed in IT department and the moral is gone now. Many good people left the company and most are looking. Bonuses were cut because others failed at their tasks, but all were punished. Very unfair and unprofessional environment. I would not recommend working at this company to anyone."
good,"Low pay. Slip seat intermodal company. Blue Cross Blue Shield run $123 a week if you walk into the Emergenci room it’s a $300 co pay "
good,"Cool place, but there is little to no room for advancement. They offer an awesome environment, but the pay isn't great, and you will never truly be appreciated for your work."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,No benefit  and they don't enough. No holyday pay but the manager is great. The ultimate fact about hub group is pay you less compared to other companies.
good,The equipment is being destroyed by carefree drivers! The new policy of sharing an assigned tractor with a driver from the opposite shift isn't working as the 'day' drivers work 13 to 14 hours per shift( mostly) and this places the evening driver in a predicament of having to wait for his/her truck to be returned! Many drivers disrespect the equipment and aren't held accountable !
good,Front facing camera will come on with out your knowledge will write you up for everything under the sun. Very snobbish corporate act like they dont  need the driver for trucking company .Company will mess up your check every week so get ready.
good,when I first started the management team was great. Well thought out plans very direct orders that were explained how to apply them. Since the company grew management was moved around. Now there is no order. No real direction or communication. The decision made are not about promoting success or saving money just I want to do this don't question I don't care if it works make it work. So many times you would get two completely different directions to do the same thing and if you questioned which one you get in trouble.
good,Full of mostly good people. A lot of upper management is dysfunctional and clueless about actual day to day operations. Too much of a political feel. Lower level management is great but the message gets lost up the chain.
good,Very good place to work if you are able to handle a fast paced environment. you will be thrown in the fire very quickly after starting so be prepared to jump right in and make calls and book loads
good,"It’s a lot of rumor driven changes. You never know what’s going on one day to the next and questions to upper management are not encouraged,in fact usually shot down and told to drop it.  Not a good environment"
good,"At the time I worked the equipment was below standards, and pay was less than area. left because more pay and equipment. 3 day orientation, and cameras in truck for safety"
good,"Beautiful building with great views and very nice cafeteria. Management and key account team stretched out very thin with constant issues knee jerk reaction expectations. Team was great to work with, however, it felt that the work day was never done and when you did leave for the day the work continued to come in after hours and felt that you were never able to catch up and always working from behind."
good,"-Too much work and not enough capacity"
good,Enjoyed that it was a fast pace environment and learning new things every day.
good,After 3 and a half years handling special projects and 4 and a half years with the company I'm ready to move on. Very little room for growth from the driver pool. I would recommend working here  my time has just come to an end with this company.
good,"Overall the company seems to be healthy financially. However, with the ongoing work load additions it really makes it hard to achieve all of the metrics set forth by the management team."
good,"As a contracted commercial driver I learned to :"
good,"Good place to work but not organized, and some of the managers don't respect their employees,  no one is there to help when trailers need approval.  employees are stuck at the delivery location for hours at a time waiting on managers to respond"
good,"Day starts at 0600 and is fast paced until end of day. Lots of driver interaction and problem solving as in all trucking operations.  I learned that HubGroup operates as a freight brokerage company, and Hubgroup Trucking is looked at like any outside carrier when it came to freight distribution.  HubGroup is very successful with this model, but it sometimes leave the HubGroup Trucking driver fleet under-utilized.  Drivers and office staff needed a lot of leadership in fixing very poor working relationships.  Took some time, but things going in the right direction.  The hardest part of the job, was dealing with the attitudes of the people whose job was to support me. Never had to deal with what at time was an almost hostile environment. In the Austell Operation, Senior leadership talk a need for change, but are unwilling to give change a chance.  Culture of micro-management until things go wrong, then there is a scramble to place blame on the subordinates. Hubgroup Trucking overall has the makings of a great company. The need for leaders who put the welfare of the company and the people they lead ahead of their own, is desperately needed.  The most enjoyable part of this job was to see the positive change starting to take hold."
good,I am sorry but I cannot recommend this company as a place to work. This is based on their poor management skills of running various departments and severe lack of training their employees. I was laid off for no reason after taking on additional tracking responsibilities. I went through four managers in 16 months and it just showed a lack of caring about me as an employee.
good,"This job is very easy its a lot of drop/hook. Typical day starts at 6 am p/u load from UPRR deliver to customer,repeat"
good,"Pick up Rail load at yard, and deliver to destination. Gone Monday thru friday."
good,"I started at Hub Group as a Regional Driver for 5 years and transition to Owner Operator and it's not what I expected money wise. I would not complain about the money if they could give me loads as I request them, I would sit and request for a load and wait hours before anything comes across my Qualcomm, also 2 loads will not make you any money here you have to do at least 4 to 5 a doay inorder to be successful and have money to maintain your equipment."
good,Very time sensative industry with lot of moving parts one needs to pay close attention to. Most communication done via email constantly tracking and tracing cargo with 120 emails to review each morning. Long hours glued to the screen and little room for error.
good,"Hub Group is an industry leader in the 3rd party Intermodal industry.  They have begun to address their Company Culture to appeal to new and existing employees. They are continually trying to get the right blend of individuals in place to be on the forefront of their industry. I respect, and admire how the Company had evolved over the 15 years I was employed by them."
good,"* Fast paced environment "
good,"Nice place to work, drivers are good people, management is good.  Hours are suitable. Software is easy to use and learn. Corporate office is helpful. Staff is friendly"
good,"I thought Hub Group Trucking was a great job when hired. But after two years and four months of employment, I became a number in the system instead of the person they. Even though I was an excellent worker doing whatever was asked of me without complaints, I was terminated without being asked the circumstances for what they terminated me for. So future applicants think twice before you sign the dotted line or you will end up like me after a couple years of employment. Don't think I'm a bitter former employee because I'm not just a present and future informer. Good Luck."
good,"Stable company with job security and benifits"
good,"A typical day consists of 100+ phone calls while multi-tasking on TPS system to update, create, and maintain information.  It can be a very stressful job at times depending on projects, weather, and certain aspects which you cannot control.  I have learned a lot about logistics and enjoy the open environment to ask questions and help others as it is a nice change of pace away from the phones.  The people are mostly a younger group ranging from 23 to 45 which can be a nice mixture of culture.  The management has the right idea but some of their business decisions and implementations from the Sales Reps really make you scratch your head.  It is a good job to get your foot in the door."
good,"I am a good hard working person who is always on time , like early mornings very good character, excellent customer veryggood.service,verdgooddriving record"
good,Nice company place to work for when the freight is available.  It's a seasonal job.  They will keep you busy all year if they have loads.  They are great company
good,Though they provide experience in the transportation industry there is absolutely no room for advancement and certain positions are based on commission.
good,Fast-Paced environment. Attention to detail is crucial. Must be able to work in multiple systems and multi-task. Most enjoyable part is my Co-workers.
good,"I got really really frustrated in the rail yards waiting all the time on the dispatchers trying to get things right. This company pays by the miles and hour.. while you will get paid for being somewhere at a standstill, you loose money on the miles..you won't make as much but you will work..."
good,"Loved the company, worked for 2.5 years then was let go due to cutbacks. Will also mention that I was a good employee, and I believe there were some wrongful reasonings behind my being let go. Company in Toledo has a bad habit of hiring friends and family members, and over hiring temps, resulting in the loss of actual good employees."
good,"Overall, working at Hub Group has been good. However, recently the turnover has increased which makes me uncertain of Our Mesa office. "
good,"The company has an unsaid expectation of working more than 60 hours a week. There is an unsaid push for results over ethical guidelines and a balanced take on work and life. The company is growing and is good for young employees willing to put in a lot of work. I cannot speak to the overall company, because i was only in one office, but i experienced an office culture that is rife with nepotism and in/out groups. Life is good if you are with the ""in"" group, but very unpleasant if you are not. "
good,Very fast paced work environment. Many employees drive at a speed in the warehouse yard that is not very safe. I keep my speed steady and safe at the same time not slowing production.
good,"Hub Group Inc. is a great company to get your foot through the door, but that's about it. The company has gotten rid of many employees while working there and there tends to be a bias when the company evaluates candidates for promotions. Don't get me wrong, one will get the experience and opportunity needed to be successful in Transportation, but it would be a stretch to say Hub Group Inc, is a company where you have job security. It seems like every couple of months there is turnover."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,"My experience at Hub Groups been good however, there are still a few dynamics that must change in order to make the company more efficient and appealing to it's future employees."
good,"Really enjoyed my time with the company and thought it would actually be a long term career. However company had one bad financial quarter and went into cost cutting mode. Because of that, they decided to shut down a very profitable terminal (mine) and merge it with another terminal and only gave me 2 weeks to prepare. Was offered a position in the other terminal but that definitely was not feasible since that other terminal was 150 miles away."
good,Company has a great work culture and wonderful people. There are great innovative projects in the works and the company is gearing to take over intermodal markets in the country
good,I did not work here for long but did enjoy the work I did. It was my first job and it did help me stepping foot into the work force.
good,A typical day at work would be working with different vendors and researching their load tenders to make sure everything is accurate. Make appropriate adjustments if need be. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure you had enough time in the day to make everything possible.
good,"Dedciated was fine,  Managers are a little stuffy, but over all good job"
good,A typical day involves working through a couple email boxes which will keep you busy with things from pricing projects to collections issues. Phone calls will come in from sales people periodically. Larger pricing projects will entail meetings with sales and management to review expected margin and competitiveness. Work tends to be done as an individual and working in teams on the same project rarely occurs. Co-workers tend to be in the younger age range. mid-twenty to early thirties with Management being mid-thirties to fifties. The hardest part of the job is time management and organization. Work will get busy for an extended period of time and it is easy to get very backed up. But those difficulties are matched with success sometimes of obtaining new business or growing existing accounts.
good,"A typical day at Hub Group consists of hundreds of emails. Updating drivers to receive payment for time worked. Answering phone to assist drivers with pay. Entering and billing charges. Assist the driver managers, account management team, and terminal managers with meeting the needs of drivers."
good,Average place to work. The environment is good and I have learned additional leadership skills while working for the company. The hardest part of the job is the obstacles that arise in moving products via rail.
good,"fast paced, multi- tasking all day, worked in many different modes of transportaion, appearances are important, promotions are often not skill based, corporate management a little too removed"
good,"Due to the size of the company, it was often difficult to progress a deal. Customer service was a challenge due to centralization. Good leverage in the marketplace due to size and scope."
good,Days are very good at Hub. Able to have fun while working. I have learned great skills that I can use in the future.
good,"Hu Group is a very relaxed place to work, you can generally make $1000 per week in a 5 day week if freight is consistent. Pay is a combination of miles plus hourly, so fyi"
good,Good company but I'm currently in a bad management situation and am looking for a change.  The current role and manager I have is very micro managerial.
good,Its a great company to begin your career with. Your DM can be your friend ogee your worst enemy.  The home time is awesome of you like being home often
good,Enjoyed working with this company lots of hours very nice equipment the night shift had good driver management and my overall supervisor was extremely good to work with .
good,"Very disappointed in how the acquisition was rolled out. Six months or so of playing it cool, like all was good. Then 6 months of disgusting amount of growth with absolutely no warning, far beyond what was discussed when the acquisition was announced. Then 6 months or so degrading us for our performance, complaining we were losing them money and unable to keep up with the unanticipated growth. No Christmas bonus like the previous 15+ years and no communication, really hurt some people's Christmas who live pay check to paycheck. And then a mass wave of layoffs. I was not laid off, however was sooo greatly disappointed in how it was executed."
good,"Management team need focus and trained in technology that the company use. "
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,Hub Group is still a good company to work for just need to get the management together. Overall still been good. I just wish they stop harassing the driver for everything. Remember driver are more important part of any transportation group. If drivers are not happy then the morale of company falls way short of anything positive to achieve or represent as such
good,"Well, I guess to every truck driver or anyone who works for them it would be different but in my experience with this guys is okay. I don't think it is fair to work every weekend, but it is part of the job."
good,"Hub Group is a solid company, after some restructuring the office was closed and the operation change. "
good,"Very good Management, keeps the company growing even in the environment gets tough. I wish them good luck."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and decent compensation package. Industry is volitale at times.
good,You get out of it what you put into it.overall it's a good place to work it has its bs but name me a company that doesn't it's all a matter of what you can deal with.with that said the chassis used which were owned by the railyard were absolute garbage god help the driver who caught an inspection.but from my understanding that is typical and run of the mill for intermodal so it is what it is
good,The management team is professional. The team usually has a prepared schedule to meet daily quotas. The employees are typically satisfied with work conditions.
good,". Delivery Services and Time Management"
good,"Opportunity "
good,"Fast paced, team oriented work environment. I have learned great negotiation skills, while enhancing my interpersonal skills."
good,Industry has low profit margins. They were constantly trying to get computers to do the work that people did. Coworkers were good to work with. My job was eliminated along with about 30 other people when they moved all of our jobs to another office.
good,I truly loved working at Cornerstone the management was one of a kind and treated everyone like family. I would highly recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,"I walked into The Hub Group with almost no knowledge of the transportation industry.  Based on my clerical background as well my outgoing attitude they took a chance hiring me.  I have learned a great deal about transportation from schedules that accommodate drivers as well as maintain production for the customers serviced.  I have a working understanding of transit times and DOT laws.  I have gained a strong customer service skill set that can be applied to most industries.  In addition to my knowledge of customer and carrier relations, I have also developed negotiating skills that allow me to maximize financial margin to the company while still maintaining a relationship with both the customer and the carrier involved with the daily projects."
good,I worked there for 14 years in various positions in IT.  It rewards hard work and dedicated employees.
good,While Hub Group is a good company to work for the environment can be a bit too rigid in some aspects. I lost my job for problems out of my control that were caused by the customer.
good,"Wonderful people and good leadership made it a great place to work. Unfortunately they moved the entire Load Planning group to Chicago. They did give me a generous severance package "
good,Industry is competitive and retention is very key to the culture. Safety is the most important part of course to maintain. Long hours and upper management rotates too often with many changes. Overall I opened the Terminal with corporate goals in mind and exceeded most goals. I would HubGroup for employment.
good,If driving local is what you're looking for it's an awesome place to work just in the Monroe location there's a lot of room for growth and Improvement within their management staff and coordinating together as a team
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,"Here we go again, you are asking me to write 150 characters minimum for no good reason. I am just trying to apply for a job, not tell someone about my previous one."
good,"Work 45-50 per week, at least one Saturday per month also. Short staffed, on emails and phone calls all day, no time to take a lunch. Co-workers are good but job doesn't allow you to even take a break, always busy."
good,"Only good chance to advance is to relocate to Chicago suburb. Also, bosses do not communicate very well. A new employee will not understand his or her role for quite some time."
good,"I worked my way up at Hub and for the most part, I was taken care of. It was a high stress, face paced job that sometimes was hard to deal with. I worked with a great group of people though who knew how to have a good time after working hours. Not much fulfillment as far as jobs go though."
good,"Management provides direction and guidance, however, promises of additional training and cross departmental training never come to fruition. Pay is on the low side unless you're a director or above, benefits are good but you pay a lot for them. Decent PTO and holidays, but you can't roll anything over. Even after over a year, still difficult to get a raise"
good,"Lots of growth opportunities and the ability for new employees to be creative within their roles. Lacking in structure is my only critique, despite being in business for over 45 years."
good,I don't have anything to say about a review with this company right now because I'm still employed at Hub Group. So far this place is really a decent place to work at
good,I enjoyed The pay being a truck driver. That was It. It kept getting harder With all The Government policies. Parking was always a nightmare because of The new computers in The trucks. If You weren't in a spot by 1900 GOOD LUCK. The caliber ofdrivers was getting worse to. Almost got run off road by Truck drivers almost daily. My health has gone down hill in That truck also. Never no exercise.  14 hours a day every day. Drive- eat- sleep- repeat. I need a change!
good,"Always conducting orientations to hire or lease on new or rehired drivers. Great place to work, Best part of my job was to help drivers. Hardest part was all the travelling, and having to relocate in short notice."
good,"Fast paced environment, never a dull moment."
good,"As I being with this company, people are very friendly and helpful when you get stuck on something that you don't know. The great thing about this company is the Benefits and the pay is ok."
good,"at first it was a great place to work, but then things changed. I felt more like a number than a person-didn't know who to contact regarding problems in my department. Drivers called about issues with their pay or at the terminals and no one seemed to care. It was very discouraging"
good,"Safety 1st training videos and retired state police conduct random 3 months annual inspection on units, co-workers are friendly and helpful, overall good working environment in Kearny terminal"
good,For anyone looking for a great job and start to get into the rail and container side of truck driving going there is great. You will get trained and get a great understanding of it
good,"Steep learning curve, but patient management team with lots of training. Work is challenging, but opportunities to advance. Great people, which is important due to team success."
good,"A great stepping stone for career advancement. I had complete support from top management, owners, and board of directors."
good,"Laid back atmosphere.  Some process or procedures appear to be ""dated"" and redundant as some of more modern tools are not available.  The hardest part of the job is figuring out all the different points of contact and their process as every one appears to have another process they use."
good,My experience at HubGroup was very positive. Every day I came in ready to work because of the fast paced environment and great co workers. Very positive environment to learn and work in and I would recommend HUB to anyone.
good,They pay excellent but you have to dedicate your entire waking time to your job. If you’re looking to get out of OTR and start here so you have more family time?...don’t bother. You will work 14-16 hrs a day
good,"I can only speak about Birmingham terminal. I love it. I have never heard one drive out of Birmingham  speak bad about the company. Everyone loves our terminal manager. You will hear drivers say we could use more money. It's a trade off, be home more, make a little less. Days are long. If you need someone to babysit you or hold your hand, go somewhere else. The DM's and terminal manager are overworked and can't babysit. Having said that, we can call the terminal manager 24/7 and he will ALWAYS respond. He really does want his drivers to be happy and goes out of his way for us. Sometimes I think he can be too kind with some. Benefits are much better that most large trucking companies and cost the drivers less than most. They will always repair anything on truck. The chassis at rail yards aren't always great, but they are the railroads. They have ALWAYS had me home when I need to be there. They never leave us sitting like most companies. If there is no load you bobtail or redhead. Since we are hourly and paid by the mile,  we make the same either way. Even though we are hourly, we still get detention after 2 hours. We do have front facing camera which made me nervous at first. But you learn quickly that they use common sense. 99.9% of the time, you will never hear about any recording unless it's pretty bad. Also, we do not pay for anything out of pocket. No P.O. is needed, not even for hotel rooms. They even give the drivers a corporate MasterCard for hotel/motel, and daycab drivers get to stay in them every night. They also pay $50 layover pay when you spend the night out.  One"
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,"My department was either fast-paced or dead slow. "
good,I'm a good worker. At hub group.have 17 yr in.very exp.have two yrs refrigeration exp.flat be exp.want to get with a good local work.where I can retire.would mind staying out once twice a week
good,"Daily greeting with team members and asking if they had any needs.  Extending help if they needed it through out the day.  The one on one time spent was the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job was I couldn't mentor the team as much as I would have liked."
good,Working at Hub has been very rewarding. It has a family feel and the work days are conducive to any active family life. Working for Hub has been enjoyable to me.
good,"Great company to begin with, but doesn't seem like there is a lot of room for advancement there.  Also looking for a career with travel opportunities."
good,"Hub has secured a lot of technology which makes planning, dispatching, and communicating much easier with drivers, and customers both internally and extrernally. The model from when I began with Hub has shifted and is driven much more toward asset management rather then customer centric. In todays climate it works , trailers and drivers are a scarce commodity. I have spent a long time with Hub and enjoyed mostly everything about the company. Middle level managers are great , the executive team has a different approach which  is data driven ."
good,"Its been 1 year since I posted my last review I still love getting up every day and going to work. And that's because of our terminal manager in Birmingham. He ALWAYS trys to put his drivers first. He is truly one in a billion. It's been a trying few months in the trucking industry,  but he always does his best to take care of us."
good,I like my job but they mess up my pay all the time. You need to watch your paycheck constantly. The jo is relaxed and they let you do your job. The people are friendly.  Good job. Good company.
good,Should pay more than $20.41 an hour but the job is cool easy and laid-back. Lots of hours time and a half after 8 you can work on your 6 day. Various start times
good,Great place to work management was great very helpful with concerns works day were great some times long but that was not a problem it was part of the job.
good,"A typical day at work as a Site Manager at Hub Group challenges you to make quick, decisive decisions throughout every shift.   Senior Management is available and easy to communicate with when needed.  The office culture always revolves around safety and getting every employee home to their families at the end of the day.  Even though the job is extremely stressful and challenging, making as many moments fun and enjoyable is encouraged.  The hardest part of the job is keeping a full staff of drivers, since temp usage is restricted in the contracts.  However, finding the right employees that want to grow in their positions with the operation becomes the most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job."
good,Over all the company and people working there are doing great things. The clear division between departments is a blessing and a curse. Having dedicated people to roles allows for better support but discourages personal and professional growth. Further limits to team sizes and resources makes working here a very one-track mind environment that many find discouraging when looking more than 3 years out.
good,Nice place to work.  No scheduling of breaks.  Free lunched often.  Lots of causal days with charitable donation.  Spacoius office with comfortable chairs.
good,"Productive, and stress free workplace.  Enjoyable work with great people.  Learned a great deal about US Customs and Boarder Patrol rules and procedures.  A very good training ground for entry level managers and employees."
good,"They pay is by the hour and by a percentage of the load. Equipment, everything updated. Safety bonuses every quarterly. Pay is good. Just make sure to check them loads the day before you pick up.  Make sure its there where suppose be."
good,"Hub is changing a business model to consolidate workload and some of the accountability and attention to detail is being lost . Overall it is a good place to work, but I feel that upper management has little experience in the industry and has a very small time frame of working in intermodal ."
good,"The management empowered their employees to help them understand the industry and build self-confidence. Before merging the offices, the business was very customer- oriented and we worked well within our office and with other offices."
good,"The time there was invaulable. I learned things that I never thought I would have the chance to learn. How to save money for the company, how to help the drivers committed to our excellence, and a caring for the companies and drivers I was trusting with our clients. Sugar before vinegar is my quote. Things may happen, but always service your customer and handle the issues later. They may not come back to you if you don't hold this truth."
good,The workplace was a safe and positive environment up until the company decided to move. Fair compensation and benefits. I would still be there if the circumstances permitted.
good,"My company was acquired, still learning about HUB Group.  No additional feedback at this time.  Looking forward to the opportunity to learn and grow from a global leader."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,"First thing coming in you would be welcomed with a ""good morning"". Sit down and answers emails and dispatch driver while talking with the Higher ups about which loads would need to be planned and gotten to first because their a top customer."
good,"Drop and hook from one location to another building and then bob tailing, coming from dallas to fort worth and also to okc it all depended what the dispatcher would send me to work if it was local or regional"
good,"It's a good place to work."
good,"All-in-all, the upper management of this company supported me in every aspect of my function."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Hub Group. Alot of great people and fast paced exciting environement. Consistently busy and there is always work to do when dealing with load planning for drivers. There is alot of planning and replanning sometimes to execute ontime performance."
good,Great place to work.  Laid back management style.  Lunch and breaks were at the employee's discretion.  The benefits were excellent and you really didn't to give much lead time when requesting time off.
good,"Hub Group was a great company to work for coming out of college. The people were great, the work was challenging, and there was room for growth. They did a good job of explaining the culture and history of the company. I also liked that you had the opportunity to sit with other people and departments to get a feel of what their typical day was like. It gave you a chance to see how everyone was connected through work."
good,"I liked working there. I learned some technical things there that enabled me to have open doors later. The company grew a lot over the years. I well imagine that it will continue to grow. I suggest that the one who wants to work here, to go ahead and apply. What you see is what you get.."
good,"I enjoyed 15 years with Hub Group. It's a very challenging work environment however if you like challenge, which I do, then this company is what you are looking for."
good,Professional Dispatchers with good communication skill and very helpful  when dealing with owner operators. l alway had loads to run Monday thru Friday sometime on weekends.
good,"Good company, pretty big all intermodal. Mostly regional runs no forced dispatch, good home time. Not a bad company to work for. Work is usually steady"
good,"Hub Group is a reputable place to work. They pay pretty well. The people there are really nice and open to joking around and having fun. However, the work itself can be very stressful. That's nothing to do specifically with Hub Group - that's just the transportation / logistics industry in general. Your job is to plan and fix mistakes as they come along. Great company - just know the industry you're getting into and practice stress management :)"
good,Friendly atmosphere and great life/work balance. Non-stressful job tasks and easy going management. I would definitely recommend working for this company!
good,Hub Group has a younger and more laid back culture. I have fundamentals and what it is like to be a pricing analysts over my time here as an intern.
good,We worked on the computer all day so there was not much excersise. I enjoy the transportation industry so this was an opportunity to learn another part of it. Working with the Rail Road and Over the Road personnel. Management was always fun to work for and would provide parties on holidays and incentives during the year
good,It is a good company to work for if you want to work they always have loads. They are very nice and fair very safety conscious and will help you any way they can
good,"Hub Group has several different roles available to help you learn the ins and outs of the logistics industry.  However, once you reach a certain tier of employment, internal advancement opportunities dry up as the company has elected to higher upper management from outside the company over the past 5 years."
good,"Hub Group is a good place to work,the wages are more than competitive,they take good care of us as hole company,Management actually knows you by name instead of just an employee number"
good,"great company ,fun enviroment the njob is easy people was great i enjoy my time there and all the free lunches and breakfast benefits .      "
good,"It's good place to work ,will recoment it , if you like to work hard and if you like to work all year long with stable work and if you like local or regional."
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years as an owner/ company driver.  Local area, returning home every night.  Friendly environment and very cooperative with employees."
good,Energetic and positive environment with personable managers.
good,While working here I was able to learn more about the hiring process for new employees. Fast paced and a wonderful group of people to work with. Very thankful to have the chance to work here.
good,"pick up trailer and go. safety safety safety. management was good keep to your job driving long days dealing with stores coming home"
good,I enjoyed my time with Hub Group Trucking. I appreciate how huge they are on safety. If I had an issue management addressed it promptly. I liked the equipment because it was comfortable and safe.
good,Hub is good to it's employees.  Great place to work.  No real issues to report.  They appreciate their workers and do the best to show that appreciation as much as possible.
good,"In my short time working there it clearly had the friendliest work environment and best work/personal life balance of any job I've had in my professional career.  "
good,"A typical day at work:  I would work with the customer  finding out there needs, and communicating that with the vendor scheduling appointments "
good,"Great company   The only reason that I left was that  they are switching to a new payroll system, dissolving our department and moving Payroll offices to corporate in Illinois."
