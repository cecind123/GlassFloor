good,I had a great time working there and everyone I worked with were so nice and helpful.  If I had the chance I would work there again.  We moved out of state and I have been trying to get another job in our new state to get one working there again.
good,"Busy, busy, busy! I come to work running and keep running, all in a good way. As a server, I get prepped for the shift and then begin to wait on the guests with outstanding personality to make those tips!  I soon became a trainer and trained the new servers. After a few years, I moved to Tennessee and there I was promoted to the ETC (Employee Training Coordinator). In this position, I handled all new hire paperwork and trained ALL employees for their positions.  Cracker Barrel takes care of their employees, offers great benefits, and I had opportunities to train at corporate and open a new store.  An amazing experience!"

good,"A typical day at work would be easy, laid back, tickets for the food would be under ten minutes. I learned all kinds of new things everyday, from all kinds of different people. How certain things would have to be done, I learned that in order to make a work day successful is to work as a team. Cracker barrel had the ""there is no I in team"" Policy. I transferred from the Texarkana TX, store to the Hot Springs Ar, store after a year and I got to know almost everyone there, and made good friends with them, same thing at the store in Hot Springs. I love getting to know the people I work with, for the most part they were all pretty nice people. To me, the hardest part of the job was working as mch as I did. I would go in at 8;45am on a Sunday AND Satrday morning to work on the grill line, and then take an hour os so break and come back and work that night almost every weekend. Like I have said before, I love getting to know my co-workers, and I think that's my favorite part of the job. Getting to know everyone round me.  "

good,It was great for most of the time but some time there are people that come in with an mad agenda but i try to work through it the best way i can with a smile on my face. Its not about who makes the most money its about how you enjoy it. Some thing's i didn't like was the waitress some got there way all the time while the others had to clean up after them. The hardest part of my job will be getting the food to the table because its so many people back there like i want mines first not going to ticket formation.

good,"A typical work day is very fast paced. You are always moving. Taking tables orders, entering their order into the computer, making drinks/refilling drinks, setting up trays and running food. Then cleaning the tables and making sure everything is set for the next guest. We also have side work duties like rolling silverware, cleaning tables and sweeping under them, and assigned duties for prep for the night shift. The managers were all nice and wonderful to work with as well as the large number of co workers that I had.

It is exciting to have management who wants you to succeed, cares about your input, and includes you in trying to obtain the goals of the company.  Learning about food costs, turn times (the amount of time people are sitting at the table), inventory, how to keep each department running smoothly by lending a helping hand when needed, and delivering a great customer experience was all in a days work.  As servers we were responsible for making sure all the customers were completely satisfied.

Our team was in constant contact with each other from department to department."

I learned that a smile can go a long way, whenever the customer walks into Cracker Barrel and see a smile it makes them feel welcomed and a smile is very contagious. Management and employees were great, Although to me there wasn't a hard part to the job. When your friendly and love to talk plus being opened minded to everything and everyone everyday didn't feel like work. Even though I do not work with Cracker Barrel anymore, I still love the company and what it stands for. Pleasing People."
good,"Everything about working at this place was great. The people you work with were the people you went to high school with, grew up with, knew their kids or their parents.. small town restaurant meant you knew some of the people served that day. The management was good.. they listened to us. They were stressed just like we were but they were always nice, and listened to he customers and always put them first. Hardest part wasn't really hard just annoying to ask every single customer if they would like 3 packs of gum or candy or a cd or something you knew they wouldn't want or you just get tired of asking people that same question 250 times a day. The most enjoyable part was 90% of it all.. the people you work with make you want to stay. Every now and then you got a sour person but why let one person get you down? It was a great place to work."

Keeping in contact the with managers and letting them know what is going on and if you need assistance or not. Your co-workers are there to work with you as a team, get along with one another and get the job done correctly. The hardest part of a job is if you make a customer upset, and you have to get a manager, or not doing the job correctly and a manager correcting you.

Some of our merchandise is very ""country"" looking and nostalgic. And, we have a little something for everyone! I love our management team, and co-workers, they make the customers feel right at home. And, we have the best pancakes in town!"
good,"Then people start coming in. Since it's the day shift, there aren't any hosts, food runners, or busboys, so you (as a server) have to take care of all of that. You seat the customer, take their orders, give them their food, and clean up after them. Of course, it's not like it's first server to the guest gets to keep the guest... you have to actually be fair and allow each server an equal number of tables. When you clean the tables, you have to take all the dishes down to the kitchen, wipe down the table and seats, clean up the floors (and reset the table for the next group of customers. I have learned that customer service, prioritization and multitasking is very important waiting on tables. When you are working with good management who is welling to step up and help when needed makes the job so much better. When you work with servers you are going to have a lot of different attitudes you are dealing with so when you stay positive it makes things easy to do. The hardest part of my job is when you get a customer who you just can't please. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers happy an satisfied."

good,"When I first started working for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, it was amazing how people can make you feel welcome. My co-workers made me feel like I was already a co-worker the moment I started training. As a server I learned how our guest can be happy just from greeting them with a smile.If they feel upset or just not having a good day we would do whatever it takes to knowing they are leaving with a smile on their face. I had a few that felt that way and before they left they were feeling great and gave my managers compliments about how I made them feel just by smiling and making sure they are well taken care of. The hardest part can be trying to please a mad guest and you do everything you can do and their still not satisfied. That seems to make me want to do better every time. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers and the managers because I see we all doing our job and having fun doing it. How we work together and get things done it makes me feel great and go home knowing we as a team accomplished great success at the end of the day."

good,I love working there especially working in the back with the other co-workers. They were very friendly and very helpful. The management was very kind and thoughtful. The co-workers were very nice and friendly to were they will carry on a conversation during the break and after the break. The hardest part of the job is pretty much being a waitress. The most enjoyable part of my job was prepping food for the next day and so on.
good,A typical day at work included working on the cash register/in the store & seeing all my friends/managers...
good,"Everyday was wonderful at Cracker Barrel. I simply enjoyed working there and gained much respect for the retail and food industry. I learned so much valuable customer service experince on this job. The training was impeccable and I had a wonderful manager who taught me everything I know today. My co-workers were awesome people to work with and I had a great time everyday I worked. The hardest part of working in retail is dealing with unhappy guests and having to know how to deal with a difficult situation, but I am great with dealing with conflict thanks to my training I received working for Cracker Barrel.

good,I loved the customers and interacting with them on a daily basis.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Typical shifts at Cracker Barrel (for a server) consists of 5 to 6 hours per day, serving between 4 and 7 tables simutaneously. I personally have learned how to deal with several stressors at once and still complete all tasks satisfactorily. The management within the Cracker Barrel company is superb, very friendly and easily approachable. The co workers carry the same goals: being to always please the guest and increase sales. The hardest part of the job is trying to please all of the guests in a smooth, consistent manner. It is normal to find yourself being pushed to limits physically, emotionally, and mentally. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have fun in the work place with co workers and meeting new people on a dailt basis."
good,i got the job at cracker barrel because i was looking for a side job. I was a stay at home mom while my husband worked but when i got a new vehicle i offered to get a job to help pay the car note. I get along with all the other employees and management and don't have any complaints. I am an easy going person and when the schedule flip flops i don't mind it at all. The only thing that i would have to say anything negative about is the people you encounter in the resturant everyday. Mostly the people are wonderful but you occasionally get people who treat you like garbage no matter how wonderful you are to them and they act like you are beneath them because you are a waitress. I love my job
good,everyone is willing to help when u need anything. Manager are great and are willing to help u.
good,Very fun job. Great customers and managers. Fast paced at times but that's how I like it. Fun friendly environment.
good,"I enjoyed making customers feel like they were family and seeing them return over and over due to my service and the great food! My co-workers also enjoy giving excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was learning to keep moving at all times, even when it is slow and I was making no money because I had no customers."
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, but I was going through a lot of personal issues at the time so I could not work"
good,I loved this job everything about it!
good,This position was always exciting. There was always new things to learn and the management was excellent
good,Cracker Barrel has been the best job I have had. They worked a buddy system and made sure that the employees all carried their own weight. During busy times we would help eachother out and do what was neccesary to keep our customers satisfied.
good,That is the best job I ever had. the managers are great and always fair. They don't talk down to you and the benefits are good.
good,"Great family atmosphere,good benefits and a good place to work."
good,The old country setting of this restaurant would leave you with great thoughts and memories from the time you park til the time you leave.
good,As an employee I knew I could go to my Manager and get things done when there were problems with orders and customers.
