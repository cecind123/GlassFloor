rating,review
bad,You will make decent money but will be laid off numerous of times per year so average out what they pay you for the 6 months of unemployment and the 6 months of work and you are actually making less than most assembler positions in the area with no job security.
bad,"Supervisors are always on your back about rates. If you get 100 percent rate, they won't come and talk to you, but as soon as you get anywhere less than 90, they are all up on you and don't want to hear about all the things you went through that day. They also don't really want to train you, that way they don't have to give you a raise."
bad,A good place to get a taste for different aspects of jobs related to manufacturing. Not a great place for long term employment or making a living. If you are not a man you get no perks at all and get dumped on with no thanks.
bad,This place sucks. They run there shop very mest up. They are a production shop that hires and fires after 90 days. Its pretty bad that when a person that gets hired knows more about machining then the supervisor does. Then instead of people who know anything about setups and breaking down machines getting the setup up jobs. they rather train someone that knows nothing about it. so if you have schooling or experince. this is a very bad place for you to look into. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
bad,"Very unstable job. You WILL get laid off here, & they will hire temps to do your job for less pay. Watched 2 men get killed here. Safety is not a concern of management. OSHA looks away as Manitowac violates safety rules.  No union allowed. Make you take furlow days without pay, then ask you to work overtime."
bad,"The best way to describe the management style here is: micro-managment and dictatorship. I was actively belittled, embarrassed in front of colleagues and demeaned by management. There is desire to ""do things the way they were always done"" and ideas are immediately squashed. I could never, and would never recommend anyone work here, unless drastic changes are made."
bad,i would not recommend this company to anyone the management is horrible production manager is very rude very unprofessional. all management plays favorites not a friendly work environment at all
bad,"Management  is terrible. If you are not one of their favorites  you get treated like dirt. The inbound supervisor  cussed and screamed  at people everyday, especially  if he was hung over or out of pills which he bought off employees.I was wrongfully terminated because they did not like me."
bad,"Unstable company.  Very economic driven; layoffs, hire, layoff, etc..."
bad,"They have no respect for the human race, the people that work there are ignorant and bullies and the upper management doesnt care about anything. Quality is so bad there, i wouldnt buy anything that is produced there. They are subbing out all the work to companies that dont care about quality either and then it comes back to grove for rework. When you have a problem and go to management or h.r, they just push it to the side and tell you its no big deal. One of the worst places ive worked for."
bad,Ask to do multiple jobs and no raise in compensation. Poor management do not follow company policies. Have to be with the in crowd to advance in the company.
bad,"Terrible management, angry coworkers, no heat or air conditioning.  10 minute breaks."
bad,"had word as long as they had parts to do the job"
bad,This wouldn't be a bad place to work if the management wasn't so horrible.  You have to be a family member or a friend of management to move up. They don't appreciate hard working people. No air conditioning or heat. Amazon pays the same with better working conditions.
bad,"The worst management I have ever seen,you literally have to see it to believe it ! The only reason anyone stays their is the pay and insurance, if either where less, they would be hard pressed to find employs !"
bad,I made Kenmore stove handles on a plastic injection press. It was just another job to go to.
bad,In my 31 years with Manitowoc Ice I feel I helped them grow into the corporate giant of today.Worked many long hours that helped produce record proffits every year. Now cheep Mexican labor is taking our jobs from us. So much for loyalty on the company's part.
bad,"This place is a dump."
bad,do not work for this company its constant layoff very unsafe shop will never work for them again I lost a finger working in this place I repeat do not work here
bad,Mantenimiento es un patriarcado  siempre ven por ellos solamente y no les importas
bad,"Constant job cutting due to reorganization(s), lack of long term direction."
bad,"I was told I would be working four,  ten hour days. As a supervisor you can expect more, but I did not expect 55 -60 hour work weeks rotating  to 2nd shift for weekend coverage on a regular basis ( was told 2nd shift work would only be needed for vacation coverage) The company is lacking integrity and has no problem lying to your face. I was not allowed to be consistent with discipline which caused poor working relationships. There is very little support at the Port Washington facility."
bad,"All in all not a bad place to work but management does a lousy job of scheduling work and do not stand behind their employees. When end of month comes, some areas have to work mandatory while the ones that are behind don't"
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company due to the lack of job Security they cannot offer you. They moved manufacturing to Mexico. They have few office jobs that may or may not move.
bad,in the nearly 4 years I worked there I laid off over 450 people. They lie to their employees and make it impossible to build a good team
bad,"This organization is not employee friendly.  There is no regard for the hourly employee. everything is management based."
bad,"Very productive. Learned alot about the product"
bad,"Indecisive and unfocused leadership. No investment in longterm product roadmap and development. No investment or priority in reliability and industry leadership through innovation, establishment of basic evaluation procedures, reliability standards and proper product performance specifications."
bad,Leadership is very deceitful and cut-throat.  Will often throw their own team under the bus.  Insulting language from leadership.  Unrealistic expectations on project execution time.  Significant interdepartmental conflict.
bad,Was a temp for this company was sent home at dinner one day so I went to look for another job told management about this ask Where I Stood and never got a complete answer from them
bad,The new management is closing the Manitowoc plant and is moving it to PA after being in business over 100 years in Manitowoc.   They build a good product.
bad,"New CEO, eliminated a lot of positions"
bad,"I enjoyed a majority of the people I worked with, but if you are a strong willed individual who is not afraid to stand up for yourself, this is not the job for you."
bad,"5 yr.s or less,near Full retirement,bring chapstik to work day,a--kissing begins,what's seniority Scab Shop"
bad,Will work. Mon-Fri sometimes Saturday for overtime. Will have food caterd if the numbers are met. Work friendly very fun and open to suggestions by employees.
bad,"Great coworkers, overall good work experience but gradual worsening of management leading to plant closing. Overtime was mandatory at times ,but volunteered for many hours of voluntary overtime."
bad,"I had to get everything organized at the beginning of the shift, co-worker was cool. the heat got to me some days. The company is a place for if you want to move on from there on to a better place to work. the hardest was the shift change, getting info was like pooling teeth. Enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands."
bad,-time management
bad,"poor management. no room to grow "
bad,Worked there two years and was not a good working environment between the unions and management.  Also upper management and engineers developed two new crane models which had electrical problems and bottom level engineers and workers had to figure out with out any help from more knowledgeable people.
bad,"The current leadership team, was viewed and labeled as Lean Experts.   Their definition of Lean is to batch individual work centers to reduce change over costs.   "
bad,very chaotic atmosphere. disconnect between management and hourly employees. too many weekend hours. good pay. needs better facility
bad,"Lots of cost cutting, lack of resources, in the midst of organizational changes"
bad,"Work prioritizing, dealing with multiple individual requirements, interact with people of all levels"
bad,"the company was very safety oriented. building cranes was very gratifying to see them get built from sheet steel to a fully functional crane. I was fortunate to see all aspects of the proses from burning to layout ,forming small weldments large weldments to boom shop."
bad,"When I first started working there it was the best company I had ever worked for by far. Unfortunately in the name of global competition it has turned into a toxic environment. I left because the department I worked in management was clueless and for some reason if you tried hard to do your job it really upset him. But he would reward the ones who sat around by giving less to do. "
bad,"Much better people and management in the production facility vs the office environment of the company. The only reason I have stayed is because the pay is good. Constant threats of layoffs, poor management who don't care about their employees, and no chance for advancement if you're a woman or not in with the right people. Find someplace else. You'll be much happier."
bad,"Major changes are negatively impacting the Foodservice Group performance. Way too much strategy changes, cost cutting, reorganization, manufacturing consolidation leading to poor project execution, high turnover and shrinking market share."
bad,"poor communication skills demonstrated over and over and over again."
bad,"great pay, cleaner shop than most places and great insurance. really small though, pretty cramped most of time. unfortunately the tools and equipment there are pretty beat up, they could stand to focus more on that."
bad,My experience was like all my other temporary jobs. You work till you get the company caught up and then they keep a few of the temp workers.
bad,Enjoyable work  Environment. But because of poor management lots of good workers lost jobs and were forced to relocate to find new employment.  Would have definitely retired from the company if it wouldn't have closed the doors
bad,Continued reductions in work force will make future difficult.Business split with Food Service will show painful cyclicality for Cranes. Good luck to workforce.
bad,great place to learn but left many people jobless and than some lost their lives out in Pennsylvania. its too bad because they had a good thing going in manitowoc and was very safety minded there
good,"MANITOWOC a nivel mundial tiene un prestigio indiscutible, pero en Portugal es una empresa que no respeta a las personas a nivel profesional y mucho menos en el trato personal. Sus directivos y mandos medios se conocen desde la universidad por lo que algunos de ellos ocupan puestos para los que no están cualificados, no conocen el producto y mucho menos saben dar soluciones al cliente en momentos críticos (Grúas Telescópicas). En grúas torre al parecer se manejan bien, pero no en grúas móviles donde ni siquiera saben de repuestos solicitados por los clientes que siempre envían equivocados."
good,"I am working as a GET so every day there is a different work for me, we have completed projects like FMEA, Staff in the company is helpful,"
good,My job was to set up and operate punch presses of various sizes. I ran one off and two off progressive dies along with some stationary dies. In addition I trained new employees in the set up and operation of punch presses.
good,"Worked as primary sysadmin at Manitowoc location prior to company split.  Learned much from peers on site as well as remote. Management was confusing at worst, and vague at best, global tasks came from Corporate and regard to local issues was lacking.  Hardest part of the job was addressing local needs with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"Union shops in Wis.will pull work from nonunion scab shops. Shop is cold/hot,dark, dirty.Shifts argue."
good,"I learned a lot working there, but by other employees. there is no traing time or program .  You basically learn as you go. Usually by making mistakes."
good,They would not make changes to parts and service to increase customer satisfaction
good,"While upper management had good intentions, there was little to no definitive direction which left all structures of the company struggling to find focus.  Pay and leave was comparable to other companies but the work life balance was poor."
good,"The company is going in the wrong direction ever since it has decided to move its operations to Shady Grove Pa., it was a nice place to work up until last year."
good,"I did not enjoy working with this company. there were too many people in one small area while you're working. there were not enough managers, and not enough training to do the job well."
good,"I wanted to retire there before the door closed in  January of 2016. A good job and work with good and smart people under the worst conditions at the end."
good,"# My Boss always help in my work"
good,"The IS dept is a complete mess and it all starts at the top. Mid-management is great and is stuck in a stalemate because of unnecessary restrictions and demands brought forth by their director, Whether this is multi-million dollar company or not, the IS director of the Cranes division doesn't believe in innovation nor honesty. It shouldn't take a user with a broken phone to wait over a month to get it replaced, especially when it's company owned. The director of the Cranes IS dept also doesn't believe in integrity and is misleading the rest of the department in terms of direction. I've worked with many companies and it's a shame that they can allow an IT dept to have a black eye especially when it is supposed to keep the company running at full speed."
good,"buena empresa para laborar"
good,"num dia normal de trabalho as ligações com outros colaboradores é mais próxima e saudável."
good,"Sin embargo el machismo, las malas prácticas el amiguismo y la desigualdad en los salarios es abrumadora."
good,"Upper Managements style is constant yelling, fighting, and blaming instead of working together to get things done.  The Mid-level managers are scared to speak their minds because Senior Management dictates every step and you can't make decision on your own."
good,Lots of red tape and very difficult to get decisions made. No acceptance of responsibility when errors are found. There is a lack of cohersion which lends to delays in decision making. Promotions are not consistent with job requirements.
good,The people are good but looking at there are many chiefs and fewer Indians.  Each time Reduction in Force happens the are even less indians
good,"The company doesn't provide much of a career path for Engineers wanting to progress to Executive role in Management. "
good,"Journal Entry Preparations"
good,Well known product manufactured.   Workers mostly from small town and surrounding small communities.
good,"Everyday hard work,help co-workers learn the job. Maybe you got to be cross trained if you did learn the job in A efficent time. Management was fine, most of co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of this job was reading the blueprints I think they were the very compact / running together.Learning all the new things that went with this assembly job."
good,"Very hot environment, no fan nor air conditioner. You have to bring your own fan from home. Management is okay. A lot of heavy lifting. Most enjoyable part of the job is able to bring in your own radio."
good,"I really enjoyed the product, work and experience at Manitowoc.  The day to day activities varied but were always interesting and challenging.  The people were open and helpful.  Everyone had a very approachable presence."
good,"The ability to advance is low here. Great place to start off at, but would not stay for to long. Low pay and the company does not want to reward the employees based on performance level."
good,"The actual job was interesting and challenging. My coworkers were all wonderful, devoted, and driven to deliver the best product possible. Everyday brought a new challenge. There were ample opportunities for self improvement, continuing education, and even first responder training for volunteers. The company was very safety oriented and had one of the lowest recordable injury and loss time injury numbers in heavy manufacturing."
good,Ok work environment. Good people. Processes need financial investment. Current economy not helping the Crane company since it slit form the food service division.
good,"Recent changes have caused this company to make reductions in the workforce by huge amounts.  There is no stability at the moment, and management is in flux."
good,repetitive machining in semi clean environment supervision to a minimum not very good at helping workers with things they're suppose too
good,"typical assembly line work, repetitive work throughout the day."
good,I welded on the boom points.i liked what I did it was very rewarding.i left there with promises that were not kept from heavy metal.a big mistake on my part.
good,great people and great work enviroment and good place to work
good,"Agradezco mucho en aber llegado a manitowo porque hay desarrolle mis habilidades como operador de punzonado gracias al apoyo de todos mis compañeros."
good,"Manitowoc Foodservice is a good place to work if you desire to learn the A to Z about manufacturing food service products.  The management is willing to allow you to grow at your own pace and help develop you if you choose.  The pay is low for the surrounding market overall due to being 30 minutes form Memphis where you can earn $3 or more hourly.  However, the culture of family and level of security is one that can not be purchased for an additional hourly wage.  Moreover, you really get that sense of family and the senior management will support you when you need them."
good,"like the job itself, pay is good, good benefits, supply all tools and materials, tool vending machines, breaks could longer"
good,"not secure company to work.Work day from 8;00 AM until 5:00 PM. Learned process, management hard to work. MRB meeting not much to say."
good,The hardest part of my job was correcting errors which other employees continually made on my machine. A typical day at work was stressful but I enjoyed highly my position at MTM.
good,"I have gained a wealth of knowledge from this company.Management is another story that I dont want to get into,love to work overtime.Co-workers are ok,I enjoy when everthing runs smooth."
good,mass o menos ya que la cultura laboral no es la deacuada.
good,"I left because I wasn't sure about the long-term prospects of the comapny. Paid very well and job was challenging enough without being stressful, but the day to day stress of the uncertain future was enough for me to decide to leave."
good,"The company was on rough times when I left, and soon they shut down their flagship plant in Manitowoc WI.  Bad leadership and marketing led them to the point of being bought into and broken apart.  Sad."
good,I liked the job very much. I learned a lot about the recalibration process of a new mobile crane. I also learned that the upper management of a large company can really make or break the overall moral of its workforce. The guys I worked with were really easy to get along with.
good,"What I learned at Manitowoc was to work with individuals closely. Management at the end really didn't care, all that was worried about was getting Mexico up and running. The hardest part of the job was watching it leave. The most enjoyable part of the job were the great friendships I have made there over my 30 years of working there."
good,"When women do the same job as a man, they deserve equal pay and equal opportunities.  This company does not provide that.  If you are a man, apply!  Women, I wouldn't bother."
good,The company has a fast paced environment while also allowing for an opportunity to learn in different areas of the business and increasing your knowledge. There's generally good communication between management and workers.  I feel the company has a good pay and benefit package.
good,My time with Manitowoc Cranes was pretty decent. I learned how to use tools I otherwise wouldn't ever have used. Management decisions were sometimes sketchy and ultimately led to the plant disruption and closing. The job itself was an ok place to work due to the floor personnel I was in contact with. My co-workers were good people. The hardest part of the job was getting parts for the task at hand. I guess the best part of the job was the camaraderie with my fellow workers.
good,"I was over the 2nd shift operations including the whole functional team which includes, production, quality and engineering functions."
good,"I loved my job at Manitowoc.  I hated it that they ended our jobs there.  We were a close knit family.  It was a good place to work for."
good,I thought this company was a well organized place to work. Everyone was always doing what they were supposed to.  I enjoyed working for this company.
good,Company is moving out of state.  I liked most of my co workers and immediate supervisors.  I learned to operate overhead cranes.  Hardest part of my job was going in on the last day.
good,Was a great place to work for during the peak years.  Many changes will need to be made to make Manitowoc profitable again.
good,"Upper management unaware of subordinate activity, Poor employee moral, loss of productivity due to management's inability to keep materials available for manufacture.  Working conditions had deteriorated to a very low level of cleanliness and safety."
good,ok place to work   supervisor was good person       co-workers easy to get along with     hardest part was understanding managements thinking
good,"Typical day at work is fun"
good,"Good experience.  Company was very reluctant to change."
good,"The pay and benefits are very good at Manitowoc, but there is little chance for advancement and not too high of a job security unless you are in certain positions. There is also not a very good job/life balance at Manitowoc, family comes second apparently. As a working mother, this does not sit well with me."
good,"	Schedule, Manage, and Co-ordinate the workload for testing to include: Prototype builds and testing, Price cost take out testing, as well as Periodic audits for agency bodies."
good,A typical day is often unplanned as anything could happen upon walking in the door.  I have excellent co-workers.
good,Good pay and benefits and good for promotion. They treated there employees great and i enjoyed working there.
good,The co-workers were friendly and cooperative. I learned how to lead employees. The hardest part of the job was to meet the on time shipments.
good,I started there in 2012 when i first started there it was a nice place to work u were always moveing but over the years it got slower now from all the layoffs there is not enough people there to run all the machines i was layed off 6/10/16 i think with this new ceo hes going to run it into the ground.hes not thinking about the workers just the stock.
good,a nível de trabalho e colegas de trabalho é uma empresa agradável de trabalhar.
good,Large opportunities to improve culture and skills of the workforce. Learned leadership skills with all levels of the organization. Able to develop a confident team to support the organization and develop good relationships across the departments was enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work was from 6:00a.m-4:35 p.m. Mon. thru Thur.  I worked on a assembly line so u always had something waiting on you.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with everyone. The insurance and benefits were very good. The management was o.k., but not the best.  I learned how to build, clean, and box units.  The workplace experience was friendly."
good,When the company was splitting into two job security went out the window.  It was sad that the company split in two.   IT was destroyed.   The Corporate office was eliminated completely.   If you were with the food service side you made out well.
good,Loved my job and the people I worked with but they closed our plant unexpectedly and moved it to Mexico sadly.  Management and HR was great at the locale level.
good,A fast pace work day and a daily quota to meet. Very friendly employees and always there to help. Ownership has changed a lot and is no longer in arround.
good,"Great company to get hired by when I was fresh out of high school and deciding what i wanted to do for a living. With no professional experience, they hired me and paid e while i received an education that otherwise would have been an expense to me. The work was enjoyable, but that was only when business was good. Lay offs were often and eventually the company shut its doors to move to a different location to save on costs and left more then 500 hard working people without jobs."
good,I have learned all facets of the manufacture of Ice Machines.  I value the support of my peers and the cooperation of the operators.
good,"Good working experience providing training and employment assistance to co-worker everyday. "
good,"I loved the history and working with the people who had been around for many years. You can definitely determine that college degrees are not all that it takes to make a business successful. Most people that I worked with who had been around for years that came straight out of high school with no degree, knew that job better than anyone who came straight in with a degree could even comprehend. I loved what I did, I loved the work involved and I volunteered for everything they would allow me to learn. Unfortunately, that became the downfall because over the years, I had a lot of experience in several areas and knew all the go to people to get information that I needed. I developed a ton of great relationships with people, young an old. The worst part of Manitowoc to me was not the work, or the people. It was management. The worst management I had ever seen in a company (my area) in general. I can honestly say because of poor management and their horrible communication skills, they got rid of a lot of their best people and a lot of their best people either quit or moved on."
good,"welding all day, really hot. how to mig tig and stick weld and use the carbon arc and read blue prints."
good,"The work atmosphere here was mostly relaxed. There are times (like the end of each month) when tempers flare, but over all not a bad place to work. The best part about working here are the people you meet & the friendships you develop. The worst parts are the communication between departments & lack of good leadership at times. You have to be able to just smile & laugh about it & go with the flow or you will not last."
good,"Loved this place, great manager easy to work with. Understood Family obligations, would go back in a heart beat, Miss this place"
good,"A good place to get welding skills and experience employers are looking for. Not much room for advancement and inconsistent work. Company is filled with poor management. Many good co-workers, but most seem to be content with mediocrity. Hardest part of the job is being motivated because the management does more to slow you down than to improve your job. The best part of the job was the pay. Not sure how long the company will be in the area yet."
good,"The pay was decent for the most part, but could have been better. 1st and 2nd shift compete like most factories. Usually friendly, sometimes childish. Great benefits from healthcare to vacation days."
good,"I have however gained confidence in my ability to adapt to a totally new sphere.  I also have been able to work with great ease with a variety of people and temperaments."
good,"A good place to start your career, much exposure to various aspects of manufacturing and operations. Direct level management is strong, much support an solid information sharing."
good,great people fun place to work free drinks everyone works together my co workers are great and we all support each other being a lead I love helping others management helps me everyway .
good,It was fun while it lasted.  Too bad they relocated. Was a relaxed atmosphere to weld in. they even offered a weld school for those who had a true desire to want to learn to weld.
good,"Enjoy my job however management is lacking in the company and I am not sure which direction the company is headed at this time, therefore I am looking for an opportunity to better myself."
good,I learned a lot and was trained well in many areas. Management was not very good in the last 10 or 15 years. I enjoyed a sense of accomplishment over the years.
good,This is a great place to work and learn welding and manufacturing while staying close to home. My coworkers and management made the day go fast and made it easy to want to come to work.
good,"I stayed busy performing job duties,I assembly from reading blue prints,management was easy to work for,enjoyed working with other people,at the end of day seeing what I acomplished"
good,The pay is good especially for the area.  Large company being ran like it is a small company.  When it's busy lots of overtime and hiring but when it starts to slow layoffs follow.  It quickly becomes not what but who you know.
good,Disappointed in the decision to move the Manitowoc location to Shady Grove.  I hope to find another job that I enjoy as much as this one.
good,"Work closely with key supplier’s/service providers"
good,"Lots of different roles in the factory, clean and tidy workplace. open around the clock doing shift work or regular days."
good,Reorganization after reorganization contributed to reduced employee engagement and difficulty gaining traction to meet goals.  New CEO in place is reducing work force and redefining organization.
good,"i really enjoyed working for Manitowoc Ice"
good,"I like my co-workers. The job is not hard, I think that the mangers should communicate better when it comes to work related matters but, overall its a good company. The benefits are good and getting paid weekly is a added bonus."
good,"While working for Manitowoc it was pretty rewarding at times, but on the other hand pretty unprofessional. The company as a whole has a pretty good mission statement and when it comes to logistics they are a 7 out of 10. I do believe that having supervisors who really train employees would be a good thing for this company."
good,"old boss was the a poor manager, recently got a new manager. So far so good"
good,Large manufacturing company with growing workforce. Friendly office environment with room for growth within. Challenging yet rewarding company to work for.
good,"entreprise agréable"
good,Great job opportunities for advancement. Quick fast paced work area. Paid for knowledge not rank so the more you know the more you get paid. Overall a good place.
good,"Start of day was safety meeting, about 10 min. Then we would go to are work stations welding what ever we had to weld. we could talk with others if needed help. we had a job and we new how to do it. Work 40 to 55 hours though out the week."
good,"you worked with groups of two or three people and it worked out good. You helped each other out, to get the job done."
good,"•	A typical day of work involved meetings, planning job assignments, completing assignments, and 5S."
good,"When the company is selling lots of cranes and business is good it is a good company to work for. But, when cranes are not selling and business is bad then they layoff lots of employees. Job security is not that great at Manitowoc Cranes."
good,the job was very interesting and the co workers was very helpful. I believe this job is a good fit for anybody that's in this field of work
good,"I enjoy working with engineer and product control to make sure everything routed through production properly."
good,"Overall, its a good place to work. Learned a lot of things related to field of study, also polished some skills related mechanical and electrical  field, analyzing parts, defining root causes and providing corrective actions."
good,"I would retrieve messages from the phone system.  I would start clearing out the email.  Entering orders for the client was JOB ONE.  I had a wonderful set of co workers, that always tried to take care of me by bring in snacks.  I was the ""temporary"", but management was not able to hire.  Hiring freeze was the hardest part of this job.  I would get so close to ""perm"", when the shoe would drop and management corporate would stop the process."
good,"As temporary employment, this position is fast paced where accuracy and meeting deadlines is of upmost importance.  With the transition of moving manufacturing to Mexico, providing accurate documentation to the Buyers aid them in making decisions. Interfacing with the Suppliers regarding orders/shipments is very rewarding.  My co-workers are under a very high level of stress due to challenges of the move to Mexico.  With the pending elimination of this position, I would not be looking for other employment."
good,They value quality over production which is a very good thing.
good,"good benefits 10 hrs,management always changing,coworkers easy to work with,shceduling trucks in for shipments,"
good,"This was an overall good work experience for me. It was a good job with good pay, the supervisors were more than willing to work with all employees at any time. There was a strong passion for safety in the work place, and the working conditions were good."
good,Great place to work but its hit or miss if you get recognized for your hard work which drives hard workers to stop trying and dislike the workers that get recognized.
good,"work passe was more over quality then speed, could spend up to four days with three shift making one Car Body. "
good,"While other people may have struggled with this company, and I certainly left before the economic downturn really hurt them, I had an overall positive experience here.  I think the company structure worked really well for me personally but I understand that it might not work for everyone.  I liked the interdepartment collaboration.  I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the various engineering experts, from structural to electric to pneumatic/hydraulics.  I never got the chance to work with the drive train team but I heard good things.  I don't know what the company is like currently, though, they've changed pretty drastically since I left."
good,"Manitowoc is making changes to enable it's future long-term growth and profitability.  The company was challenging when it was being split into two businesses, but that should insure long-term direction and strength."
good,"Welded with various types of wires and sizes. Lots of pipe to pipe/cord to cord welding. Used pulse and cv settings. Knowledgeable of running and using settings on wire sizes from .028-.052 solid wire, metal core, flux core, also hardened wires of those sizes. Some .045 aluminum.

good,I will have to keep my opinion to myself at this time!
good,Manitowoc is a great place to work as long as they aren't on lay off status. Unfortunately they are In that way more often than not. Another day is never promised here. No matter the seniority you have accumulated.  THAT IS THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE

good,It was a great place to work.  Too bad they relocated.  The pay was slightly above average.  The benefits were surprisingly light for a company its size.  On the job training was well done.
good,Cleveland facility became the consolidation point for five separate Ovens product lines.

I learned many different skills while employed with the company including safe material handling and how to build a quality product.  Due to the slowness in the plant my co workers were always changing due to lay offs and furloughs throughout the plant.  The hardest part of my job while there was decreased moral due to layoff news and cut jobs back in November.  The most enjoyable part of my job would have been that it was close to home with great people to work with when the business was steady!"

I really enjoyed teaching the service seminars and working with the technicians out in the field."
good,"A typical day at work is welding heavy plate material on huge parts. Management allows us to work independently without a hassle; co-workers are extremely helful and cool to be around, and the hardest part of the job is having to flip/move these enormously huge parts whenever necessary. The most enjoyable part is the overall environment and how laid back it is."

I ran the sub arc welder those were for the larger parts of the crane. Also fabricated different parts so they would fit properly onto the fixture I was working on."

good,I received my Yellow Belt and Red Belt in Lean Six Sigma and also took APICS training. There are many opportunities to succeed as long as you are willing to apply yourself.
good,"Great culture, friendly colleagues, management too. Pay was less than the last job I took, but the workload was less. Promises of getting hired on as permanent after 6 months and hard work like the typical run-around. But honestly I didn't really mind because I was still treated equally and I worked hard to impress my peers and superiors. Interesting benefit: You get free food that the world-renowned chef's cook up in the kitchen for some trial tests! Could be croissants, beef brisket, southwest salad, some italian sandwiches with special sauces, pastries, or waffle fries! The hardest part of the job was the quick rotation of a few employees in the middle of a huge project. Having to catch someone up on a project takes time so they not only understand, but they can contribute to the project by doing their tasks as soon as possible to meet deadlines. Employee turnover made additional unnecessary workloads on remaining employees, of course that's not the management's fault for the employees leaving. The employees that left were all older and slower than we wanted them to be. I guess when it comes down to it, they're used to projects taking longer than a few months. But I know how quickly things can be done--I digress. If you're a fresh college graduate, this is a great environment to grow in. Plenty of things to learn and the ability to get hands on experience!"
good,"Though challenging at times, this company was fun to work for and had great teammates to work with.  Projects were available to further your career and professional development."

Hardest part of the job is working smart, not hard, and resting appropriately on the weekends. The job is enjoyable mainly because of the people here. The work can get humdrum, but it's not too bad if you have music playing. Employee benefits are pretty good, best I've ever had so its hard to judge."
good,"Managed up to 45 employees in a Boom Fab Shop."
good,A typical day at Manitowoc was waiting for your daily papers to beginning working on what crane was next in line to be built. I learned a lot not just one thing there. My co-workers were wonderful. Hardest part of my job was not having the materials to finish what I started. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finish product that I built
good,This was a great place to work at. The average day was an 8 hour shift with occasional overtime. It was fast passed depending on the workload. Everyone worked together and it felt like you were part of a family.

good,"Manitowoc is a great place to work, they offer great benefits and promote work/life balance. Work is varied. Work hours can be flexible.

good,I would clock in and get right to work. my typical day consisted of making sure all parts that needed to be painted that got completed. My management was very informal on what needed to be done. The co-workers around me were very dependable to work with. The hardest part of my job was making sure all parts of the finished machine made there deadline. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all the energetic people around me.
good,"This body-shop is a well managed shop, and the quality of work that rolls out is exceptional when the project is completed. The owner gets along with every insurance companies, personal claims, and some restoration work and they work with everyone. I feel that he does not receive enough gratitude on his work. I enjoyed tearing vehicles apart, and putting them back together because it was like a puzzle and I enjoy challenges. I learned how to replace panels and properly put things together again."
good,"I wouldn't trade my experience there for anything. Very sorry I had to relocate and leave. I learned so much there in a short period of time. Management was extremely helpful, it felt like a big family to me. The work was hard and industrial but well worth the pay and experience."
good,"•	Originally hired as a welder, I became certified in both stick and mig, in all positions. After 7 months I was promoted to lead man position and assisted the manager in all activities.

My responsibilities than were to schedule materials, plan and organize my employees in order to produce the correct parts to ship to other departments.

In the machining department, I learned a lot about operating and programming CNC and PC based  CNC machines."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, muy buen trato del staff gerencial y buen entrenamiento del personal extranjero"

I even had the chance to make some much needed changes to assist with production and increase the higher end return. The employees were acceptable to my ideas and change was happening for the better. I had to watch all the hard working employees being let go though as Manitowoc Ice was moving its' operations to Mexico. That was tough to see.
