rating,review
bad,no respect from management in IT department. No support available when needed. don t like the enviorment there and no challenges at all. Limit job no learning curve.
bad,This is a place where there is no growth and advancement. The integrity and work culture is terrible. There is no team work among coworkers. Manager is not knowledgeable.
bad,Bad management that only wants yes people under them. No a good company for advancement. The CEO is not in touch with what is really go on in the company and he enjoys micro-managing.
bad,"It's a nice company, but I didn't have good experience overall there. Got to learn new things but I didn't have a nice team nor so friendly mentor. "
bad,Do not waste time in getting employed by this company otherwise yu will be muddled in internal politics and slow governance resulting in dealing with retrograde technology and orthodox work-culture. Explore new avenues instead of this.
bad,Never expect to get a raise or promotion. Lots of backstabbing and jockeying for position. Unimaginative work and people with little passion for their jobs.
bad,"Simply put, upper level management and executives do not care about their employees nor do they care about producing higher quality work. Everyone just wants to collect their paycheck and bounce."
bad,"Its a good place for interns to start working because they dump work and in the process you will learn a lot. But once you are hired, pretty much there is no pay hike or good bonuses. You should get used to working 10 hours min. Management too stingy on giving any raises. A lot of nepotism. Good co-workers. Management is the most difficult ."
bad,Expectations always exceed company capabilities. Management is unwilling to work with employees. Very poor communications. Benefits are good.
bad,"In the years that I spent at SYNP, I learned a lot and got to know some wonderful people.  However, management never changes and they do not truly believe in promoting from within.  Either you have to leave in order to develop your career, or management needs to change."
bad,"Synopsys AMS grp. has horrible compensation..."
bad,"Synopsys I believe is a good company(or so I thought it was), but it definitely depends on the business unit you are in and the associated dynamics of the accounts you support (from my position as an FAE). Managers are not always on top of things that they should be, especially when it comes to proper personel management, and can influenced and intimated by members in other BUs. The bottom line is that I would likely not work for this company again but on the other-hand, I believe they are probably no different than many other large EDA companies out there in terms of how they treat people."
good,co-workers are always supportive. excellent environment to learn and explore. i have learned new things. Synopsys provides an environment which equally balances work life and personal life.
good,"Synopsys has good technology but the company is run by engineers who don't always have the right capabilities for, understanding of, non-engineering roles."
good,"Used to be about employees, work/life balance and their career success. Changed to be more about EPS and friends and family hiring. Not dependent on skills or experience. Trained my replacement at 2/3 the salary. Implosion of groups and caustic environment. HR is seemingly unaware. Multiple acquisitions rolling in employees that are not Synopsys loyal. Top level executives are great though. Moving on now . . ."
good,"If you are able to work hard and you do not care about perks,  this is the right place for you.   You have to depend on yourself for self-improvement."
good,It was great until the layoff.  They decided to cut some real talent and I don't know how they are going to replace it.  Not very secure anymore I am told.
good,"Typical day at work would be fixing several issues that come up. Many of the things cannot be fixed because the reason why some part of the code has been written is only in the knowledge bank of some specialized team member in US. "
good,"Synopsys SIG is just 2 year old business group and yet to make it's space in the market and needs a cultural shift internally."
good,The management and product is very specialized and technical. Work environment is comfortable and healthy. Compensation and benefits are competitive with medium sized companies.
good,Aggressively moving engineering and support functions off-shore for core EDA tools.  Expanding to adjacent areas such as security based IP and software.
good,"Synopsys is a well known MNC in semi conductor industry. Synopsys ,Noida has a friendly work culture,but project deadlines are quite stringent. Client requirements are so abruptive which leads to hectic work schedule."
good,"Low pay, no no work work/life balance, poor management, not competitive work environment. Will suggest to someone only in the starting of their career."
good,"All around great place to work but has lots of hands in the process so it can be cumbersome. Management style is very task-centric so QA, Build and development will be different teams."
good,"International company so many locations to choose from."
good,Synopsys is the the leader in providing optical proximity (OPC) correction software. A large technical leader in many areas of electronic design automation software (EDA).
good,Good company but not doing well these days. Some of the best people have moved on but the company has managed to attract newer talent. close to my heart
good,The culture is good. But the industry is shrinking and the growth potential is limited. The work-life balance is overall oke. The compensation is not very competitive.
good,"Good work/life balance, not competitive salary. They have a solid and steady business."
good,"It is a good company to work for. Although in my office I have to pay anything except for capsule coffee, and there is no any gym in the office building."
good,"Working for a large company was new for me and that it in it self had its own challenges.  They do not offer the benefits as other Silicon Valley companies as they are still very old school.  They do offer a lunch room and coffee and tea, but that's it."
good,"Support with R&D, Customers, Application Consultant,  Technical Publication team, as product specialist."
good,"-Good place to work and lot of fun activities."
good,Great place to learn as a fresher for those who wants to enter in semiconductor field. Work life balance can be challenged.Good projects to gain experience.
good,Fortunately was on a high performing team with great leadership and colleagues but can't say the same for the rest of the company. Mostly everyone is on edge and frustrated because they don't think anyone else is working. Terrible communication

good,"good work life balance compared to other "
good,the work and life balance are very good in Synopsys. all my colleague are very friendly
good,"not enough innovation,  old technology,  okay job"
good,"Synopsys provides products and services that accelerate innovation in the global electronics market. As a leader in electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor intellectual property (IP), Synopsys’ comprehensive, integrated portfolio of system-level, IP, implementation, verification, manufacturing, optical and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) solutions help address the key challenges designers face such as power and yield management, system-to-silicon verification and time-to-results. These technology-leading solutions help give Synopsys customers a competitive edge in quickly bringing the best products to market while reducing costs and schedule risk."
good,The work environment in the company is very flexible and the people are very helpful if you have any questions.
good,Efforts are always recognised
good,"No longer the great company it used to be. Obsessed with saving money and improving operating margin, even though stock is at an all-time high. Now more investor focused than employee focused."
good,Work life balance is great and benefits are great. But not much opportunity to try different roles. Organization runs lean so relatively more restriction in allowing younger employee to try out different roles.
good,Synopsys has a good CEO with long term planning and vision. A lot of talented people with good idea and design culture. Lower level management are very conservative and don't take any risk
good,"Very good place to start you career, but very limited chances for advancement. Management is good and transparent. Will have a lot of opportunities to learn. Difficult to get in since, people stay for long."
good,"Très bonne ambiance entre les salariés de Wissous, mais pas d'évolution possible pour moi"
good,"Interessante und spannende Produkte."

good,"The international group was where I worked and the people I worked with around the world were delightful.  I miss them all esp. the friends I made from the divisions in Munich, Germany and Japan."
good,"It was a very good company"
good,"Magma Design Automation took very good care of the employees by providing a very good work-life balance."
good,"Synopsys is part of semi-conductor supply chain that provides essential software for chip development. It is highly technical and requires extensive knowledge of both electronics and computer science. "
good,Pros are the work culture is good and the timings are good. Cons - stable company hence learning curve might not be same as start ups.

good,Give me opportunities to learn and we get exposure to many new things. It is a very good company. Co workers all are supportive.
good,Synopsys is a wonderful company with a global presence and a great work environment.
good,"Learning wise, its a good place to work."
good,Very good company if you are in the product teams. Cutting edge technology implemented and developed. Stable company without startup mentality. Slow growth within the comoany.
good,"Synopsys is overall a very good and promising company with a very good company culture. Emphasis on employee's integrity, concentration, mutual respect, etc."
good,Synopsys is a very dynamic and aggressive place to work. There is no work life balance. Management kept changing.  Excellent co-workers and technical team.
good,Place is just like any other places. Work day is typical 9-5 and co-workers are great. Willing to help you in any way possible.
good,"Enjoy with work "
good,"Generally speaking it's good workplace for both experienced and for those who are new in this field, you can be sure that you will have work and reliable salary."
good,"While the leader in the EDA field, Synopsys tends to try to run a middle-of-the-road course in general compared to other Silicon Valley companies. Management tends to be fairly intelligent and cautious about over-expansion, which served the company well during the economic downturns of the recent past. As a result they were able to navigate tough times with minimal layoffs and a solid balance sheet. Which is not to say they are any more (or less) caring on a personal basis than any other large company, despite company propaganda to the contrary. The work environment is relaxed and casual, but not so much so that it becomes ""strange"".The company has firm goals and expectations, and generally employees are responsible and rise to the challenge to achieve. At times it can be a very high pressure environment, but that is par for the course in Silicon Valley."
good,"In Synopsys, the pay is very low for young engineers. They prefer to keep engineers with higher level, and they keep losing young employees. And there's no stock compensation for level below staff SDE."
good,"Most of technologies are 20+ year old, so if you don't learn modern staff in your free time, you'll be outdated pretty soon.  If you don't care about that, it's relatively stable place to work, leaves some time for family."
good,"- flexible work day;"
good,"You are trusted"
good,Synopsys has a great work culture.  They focus on work/life balance and follow the theory that a happy worker is a productive worker.  Sufficient training is provided when needed.
good,"Great social events, conferences, meetings where engineers can connect and share their work related experiences and share their concerns and issues or solutions."
good,"It was pleasure to work in Synopsis."
good,"Synopsys is a  mature company with strong leadership at the top. One should be able to handle pressure coming from internally (R&D, Sales, Field Engineers) and customer. It can be very challenging to balance work and life at occasion. Overall it is a very stable company with strong product portfolio and they are number EDA company. Lately management is doing multiple acquisition related to software security to diversify and those huge investments are paying of now."
good,"Company is nice, but salary not at par with market especially for people staying long time with Company. Company gives values to only external talent, but doesn't care once you are hired."
good,"Good place to work for with good work life balance. Employee benefits are not very attractive, but ok. Also recent past ( ~1 year), the company has become very top heavy. Too many people managing and very few working on actual hard problems. "
good,Synopsys is great company for C/C++ coders. The products are great and in demand. The developers are highly qualified and techinal. Highly recommeded.
good,The management of the company is very good. workload is not too much.Every one in the company is very helpful. The senior member give chance to their juniors to learn from them and to grow them technically strong
good,From the day you start they make you feel like family. People tend to stay for a long time so not to many positions open for advancement. Lots of onsite amenities and the bi-annual social events are nice. This company is volunteer focused and has many fund raising drives and  volunteer events.
good,I am working as r & d engineer for past 3 and half years. You will get good work and work culture here. Salary is ok. There is no politics at all.overall good.

good,I was a contractor at Synopsys so I can't comment on most of the categories.  I was there for two years and things have changed quite a bit since I was there.

Ordering office supplies for smooth flow of businesses."
good,"Interacting with multiple team across the geographies."
good,"No fixed incoming and outgoing time. Learning new things every day."
good,"A typical day involves a few support calls and technical consultations, current work assignment and few meetings. There is generally good visibility of your work. Salary and benefits could be more tuned to actual individual contributions rather than continuous efforts at flattening the pay curve."
