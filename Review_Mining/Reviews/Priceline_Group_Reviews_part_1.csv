rating,review
bad,"i was young so dont remember much about the work environment. relatively easy job, was pretty relaxed. customers are okay to deal with as well. not stressful."
bad,"Went for christmas casual interview. Received a call from priceline and was offered for a position in bourke st,vic. Submitted all the documents immediately and received a call this morning that they are not able to offer me the position due to the international student visa restrictions. During interview the priceline staffs were aware that I am on student visa. So why bother to call and give false hope. Huge disappointment."
bad,"While at Priceline , I learned that you may work beyond expectations, meet all deadlines and surpass all expectations. If you believe you will be rewarded, think     ."
bad,"i constantly got paid incorrectly, i felt like was being watched constantly. did come out of it with some friends. the big boss couldn't bring her self to let me go. had rude pharmacy staff and was spoken to abruptly."
bad,it may have changed a lot over the past couple of years but it has been a great start to my working career as I have learnt a lot about life experiences and how to handle certain situations
bad,"Priceline has gone through a lot of changes, and all of them are not good.  "
bad,IT management rife with politics.  Most managers concerned with their own career - staff only there to supports manager's next promotion.  Management only wants to hear that everything is ok.
bad,"Working at Priceline was not a fun workplace. Management wasn't happy and the work provided was constantly repetitive. My job was not secure, and shifts were given randomly not set dates."
bad,I had a good time working along nice people. Felt like roles would often change and management would flip a coin to make decisions. Enjoyed the gifts from the parties.
bad,The leadership team has become very short-sighted and nepotistic. The atmosphere has changed drastically of late and several key people have chosen to leave or been let go. Original ideas are often taken by LT members and presented as their own.
good,"Top down management strangles the creativity and ownership of devs and designers alike."
good,"I accepted a 3 month to hire ""deal"" (with both of us emphasizing the ""to hire"" part). And thought it was a done deal for 2 months; great team, and I fit in well. But the Director of IT ""changed his mind"" about what he wanted, hired a full time NYC tech instead of having me go down 2 days a week, and didn't even honor the 3 months. Had the Director honored his offer, I would be very happy with Priceline now."
good,filling shelves. ordering stock/stock control applying makeup on customers. analysing skin types and matching foundation for their skin types.
good,Great place to work to grow skills in current position but not a great place for career advancement.  Company prefers to hire from outside rather then to promote.
good,I was pushing for being promoted so that I could help more people but because it is a large corporation we become numbers and no longer value. I answered the phones and became a strong problem solver with the skills of negotiations for working with partners and guests.
good,"This is a good job to work from home.  But the pay is minimal and the benefits are non-existent as we are all contractors with NexRep. "
good,"good company culture, very good benefits and perks.  technology environment is fast paced and diverse.  lots of interactions between IT and the business customers / stakeholders."
good,You sit in a cubicle all day waiting for a phone call from a Hotel or airline regarding invoices. There was nothing to enjoy about that job besides the end of the day and the end of the week.
good,I had a lot of freedom to manage my own time and to be creative. I ran the operation mostly by myself and I was free to treat my clients well. Great place to work.
good,"As a store assistant, a typical work shift would involve unloading stock items from the storage rooms and placing them on the shelves. Co- workers were friendly, store was always clean and the work was never too physically demanding."
good,"typical day, filling, facing and stock"
good,"A normal day is putting out stock & customer serves   "
good,"Work environment is fast-paced and overall productive. The company however struggles with communication, both internally and with sister companies. In addition the upper management is in a frequent state of flux and confusion."
good,Good place for a first a job as it allows you to start building your qualities and skills from day one. Working in fast food opened up many doors due to how many things are taught within the work place.
good,they changed the management structure and it went down hill from there. there is also a pay gap problem for women. they make significantly less than men who do the same job. the company let go all of the original employees who had been there for 15 years or more
good,"I liked my immediate team very much, and I really enjoyed leading them. There was not much room for advancement because I wouldn't relocate. Stock and bonus plans and great health insurance alleviated some of that frustration. I had opportunities for continuing learning, but I had to point them out and ask for them."
good,"I really enjoyed my position with Priceline.com as a Business Development Manager. I was able to travel nearly 70% of the time and sharpen my sales skills with extensive outside sales and tele-prospecting. I worked with a strong group of professionals who offered support and training with a common desire to achieve success for the company and optimize revenue. Internally, we celebrated both small and big victories while pushing each other to achieve both professional and personal goals."
good,"Interesting business, lots of growth, good managment, good culture, good location. Pay can be lower but could be higher now."
good,I gained customer service experience and knowledge of various beauty products working at Priceline. I met amazing people and enjoyed the interactions.
good,"A typical day at work is fairly relaxed, my colleagues are a lively bunch! I have gained valuable retail skills and employee-customer relationship etiquette. Management is the reason why the atmosphere is so relaxed as they are quite down to earth and understanding. co-workers were obviously employed for a reason, which reflects on their jovial nature and optimistic outlook on how to perform at the best of their ability whilst enjoying work at the same time. I wouldn't say there is necessarily anything hard about the job, maybe when i first started it was hard initially getting used to being as confident and as bubbly as can be around new customers, but that is not an issue anymore as i have gained valuable experience. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new personalities every day and just being able to help!"
good,"A typical day at work is busy, so you can learn a lot by handling the day to day task."
good,"It was a good atmosphere. The staff members were incredible to work with. The company is structured well with good managers,"
good,"Priceline provides a very friendly environment for its workers, a supportive/motivated team. The job role provides a worker with higher skills in customer service."
good,"Worked with a different mindset of people."
good,Time flies daily. There's always something going on. Management could use some work. Turnover is pretty high in the finance department. Company has a great working culture overall. Lot's of work to keep you busy.
good,"A one-time industry leader, innovating with momentum with a work culture that of a hungry startup, now burdened to live up to its big brother, Booking.com's success."
good,"Priceline is a great company to work for. They offered great benefits that didn't take up half your check. They had great incentive bonuses for attendance, QA, and customer comments. During a huge Ice Storm if you had made it in to work you were given a $100 visa gift card, they catered in food and drinks. We got to meet several celebrities such as William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy."
good,"A fantastic nurturing and balanced work environment that is rapidly changing to meet the technological advancements of the industry."
good,Great work place. HR did a good job having many new activities. Work itself was very repetitive and could be boring. They didn't give us an opportunity to look into different departments
good,"This is a great company to work for when you have kids. Is very flexible, and it has excellent benefits."
good,Priceline allows your voice to be heard when making recommendations or proposing changes.  Management has a good understanding of work/life balance.  Summer Fridays are a great perk
good,"Muy saurada de trabajo y eso hacia que colgando una llamada ya tenias otra eso no era problema, el problema que te quitaban mucho bono si un cliente te evaluaba mal y todas las ocasiones el ciente te evaluaba mal por que no se posia hacer lo que el cliente queria con sus reservaciones y se molestaba aunque lo trataras de buena forma se molestaba por que no entendia que ya se habia firmado un contrato."
good,"A typical day at work requires a check of your till balance, and continuing to serve customers with a friendly smile and a helping hand. Stock refill and cleaning the store is the norm, as well as making sure each customer leaves satisfied and happy. I have learnt many new skills especially how to deal with customer problems, and to remain calm when bad situations arise. Staff are happy to help you out when you need their assistance, although the hardest part was remembering all the buttons and codes for checking out customers' goods. However, the most enjoyable part was knowing exactly what to do to make sure the customer left with a smile on their face."
good,"Great place to work with. Lot of freedom to try new things. upated technologies and lot of challenges and fun."
good,"The most impressive aspect of Priceline that I saw was the infrastructure.  There was a well-developed, thoroughly-tested infrastructure, in terms of software, hardware, and even personnel and policy.  The software infrastructure was not always well documented, but that was less problematic than usual, as there was a better than ninety percent chance that the developer who built any arbitrary component was still around to ask about it."
good,I really enjoyed working at Priceline.com. They had great ethics and treat their employees with great respect and dignity. Priceline is a fun place to work and a very relaxed and productive atmosphere. I have great memories and loved working with such a processional and fun team..
good,"As an emerging .com organization, technology was the pillar of organizational operations.  It was a necessity to develop skills to optimize the infrastructure and communicate with as many clients and prospects as possible in the most cost effective manner."
good,"Priceline has some of the best co-workers to work with. My team of wonderful girls make me feel valued and make me enjoy my time at work. The management are great and are very understanding and supportive. "
good,"amazing people to work with"
good,A typical day at work will be participating in many tasks such as register duties or doing stock. I have learnt to work under pressure when it got busy and I have learnt about many different products within the store. I am a very cooperative person to work with and always wiling to help out my team members. I didn't find anything difficult about my job it was fairly straight forward as I have been working there since 2013. I really enjoyed working with the products as I gained background information on how to sell a product.
good,These were some of the best years of my life working with some of the best co workers ever. If i could go back and do it again i would. This company was great and the customers who you grow to love and be personally attached to became like a family. A great experience i had with this company.
good,I worked in Teleperformance in Bacolod City and one of its clients is priceline.com. It was an easy job with a good pay and benefits and the working environment is fun and enjoyable since we treated each other like a family.
good,"Fun atmosphere, youthful environment. Lively bunch of employees that love to do what they do. Would most certainly refer anyone I know to apply for a position here."
good,Fast paced and fun work environment. Great on the job Training. be a part of a team with helpful management. time management is required to complete lots of different tasks
good,"typically"

good,"Priceline was by far my FAVORITE job. My colleagues and direct manager were fantastic and very supportive."
good,"web development is fun if you know what you're doing. I love the people there because they are mostly good, mostly harmless."
good,"Typical day at work, is restocking shelves, serving customers, and taking payments."
good,"I feel the team as a whole is great and motivated, I think the company model is fun to operate in. The only turn off was during their growth it felt reactionary instead of planned. I would certainly refer people to work for Priceline/Booking because they are a stable growing business with high aspirations."
good,Great Branch and great people to work with . Wide range of products some exclusive to Priceline with support and training allowing delivery of fantastic customer service. Frequent  promotions and sale campaigns.
good,"Great Place to work, great products provided and opportunity for work experience and learning including experience in "
good,"It is a fun company to work for, have open culture & great Ethics, people are tech savvy and always try to find best solutions with right technology options.  There is transparency from top to bottom on the company goals direction and plans. Constant feed back taken from employees and management acts on it."
good,"Worked for over 9 years at Priceline Fremantle and enjoyed not only the variety of customers including the regular customers over the years.  The staff and managers over the 9 years I worked there were so great, it was a pleasure working along side and for them.  I loved the variety of products priceline have and enjoyed helping customers and well as serving them at the registers.  Along with working on the register I rotated stock and made sure all the registers were stocked up with bags, register rolls etc and were always clean, along with balancing my register after each shift."
good,"Always an inviting workplace where you want to be everyday, continually finding new ways to make every task at hand effective and proficient. Constantly expanding the knowledge to our customers which will have them always leaving with positive attitude and an urge to come back for our loyal service."
good,Priceline.com has a great culture and smart people. The team I worked with was highly collaborative and willing to help one another out. I found the work to be interesting and usually challenging. I developed a number of useful skills that I feel will be helpful throughout the rest of my career.
good,"I enjoyed working at Priceline very much and interacting with customers. I've learned a lot of customers service skills and how to deal with being under pressure. My co-workers always helped me when I needed a hand, the best staff and managers I've ever worked with. Sometimes it was difficult dealing with rude customers but I don't let that effect the work environment."
good,"overall is a great company I feel the team as a whole is great and motivated, I think the company model is fun to operate in."
good,Great place to work. I learned a lot collaborating with the other QAs in the department. The commute from the train by shuttle made it easy to get to work without having to drive.
good,"This is the best work place that I have seen. Doesnt seem to be like a work place,it would like a friendly environment. Quarterly outings,summer and winter parties,celebration of almost all the occasions.Because I m working as a contractor I m searching for different opportunity or else this is the best work place for me"
good,"My positon as HR Coordinator grew as the company grew. My supervisor and myself hired and processed paper work for over 300 new employees. (I was employee #25). I was allowed to suceed in this position because of the trust my supervisor had in me to try new things and start projects on my own. This position was one of multi-tasking, being an advocate for the employees, liasion with benefit vendors and self-directed. My ability to be a ""people person"" was the best part of job, as I was able to help so many new employees and watch this company grow. Unfortunately, the company did not succeed along with many other dot-coms of the 90's."
good,Highly energized and competitive workplace.  Friendly staff.  High encouragement from administrative staff.  3 shifts operational support.  Groundbreaking technology and open learning environment.
good,I feel very comfortable work in Priceline.com. People here are very nice and the company culture is good. Everybody sit in a open course and work together.
good,"It's a wonderful work place, everyone works together when one person doesn't know what to do. We taught each other and learned from each other. Great way to improve your customer service skills and your verbal skills. While you look up customers information you must carry out a conversation in order to make them feel more comfortable."
good,"excellent place to work, huge room for technology, great work culture, compensation same as market "
good,"really placed high level of customer important. Staff always training staff members on their products. "
good,"	Answer heavy back to back call volume, resolve customer issues and complaints, work with HOTEL, AIRLINE AND RENTAL CAR Reservations."
good,"Priceline.com was located in Hartford Connecticut at the time I worked for them and I was only able to visit the office one time prior to the Priceline for Gasoline program shutting down. While I was there however I noticed it was a very fast paced environment, beautiful grounds, and great stock options."
good,"In Priceline, the environment was very nice. People there are always open to approach, even the management and clients. They provide a great amount of salary and incentives. Overall, it was a nice company."
good,"company which has good reviews good communication in all the workers management was also nice.had good expirence in the "
good,"Working as a retail assistant is a job that I enjoy the most, I love working and helping customers on a day to day basis. A typical day at work would be helping customers that need assistant or just having a casual conversation with them at the registers, seeing a smile on there faces when leaving would be a highlight as then I know I've done all I can to help. You learn different things every day working in retail such as: how to deal with difficult customers, stocking new products on shelves, meeting the stores KPI and also learning things of other workers. Management would be the most important in retail especially time management - trying to get your allocated work done on time while assisting and helping out customers and employers. Working as a team makes things so much easier working in retail as you get more things done and on time and also learning new things of them. The hardest part of retail would be dealing with difficult customers, but with a great solution would be a great outcome. The most enjoyable part of working in retail would seeing customers smile when leaving the store then you know you've done a good job in helping them."
good,"One of my favorite places that I have worked. We were busy yet, there was a good balance of work and time to learn new technologies. The president of the company made certain that Priceline Webhouse's employees were happy and well taken care of."
good,"At priceline i have learnt a lot of skills like working at the registers, helping customers and answering their questions on the products that we were selling, stocking the shelves etc. i had 1 year experience at priceline"
good,"As the Priceline Cosmetian I was incharge of the daily running of the cosmetic and skincare department. I would make sure all shelves were replenished with products facing the customer, New lines were on display and all planograms were up to date. My isle was always keep clean and up to OHS standards. On arrival of new stock i would check stock off to invoice then set up any new displays or promotional material that was sent. I would dispatch any extra stock sent by mistake or damaged stock back to suppliers. I would participating in any product training on a regular bassis and learnt as much as i could to assist my customers in right product for their skin but also to be able to train other staff members in the benifits of the products. These training coarses would range from 1 day coarse up to 3 day coarses that I would have to travel to in my own verchile and find my own accomadation most of the time. Learning as much as i could about each cosmetic and skincare house gave me great knowledge in this area and i loved sharing my knowledge with my customers."
