Learn computer system then start doing the work assigned. Never was treated poorly at any place I was assigned. People were always kind and willing to answer questions for me.

Aprendí a hacer cribas curriculares de forma rápida y efectiva. El trato con el candidato pude apreciarlo desde un principio estando presente en las entrevistas que se realizaban a diario, hasta que luego de un mes las hice directamente. Me gustó el trato con personas distintas cada día y con procesos de selección variados. La parte más difícil considero que fue curbrir una vacante de un día para otro por solicitud del cliente. A su vez atender a todas las personas que se apersonaban en la oficina con distintas dudas y al mismo tiempo atender el teléfono y de improvisto tener que resolver urgencias, sin embargo a lo largo de los días pude manejarlo y cumplir con todos los requerimientos. En general fue una experiencia enriquecedora y de mucho valor para mi desarrollo profesional."

good,"The staff was very considerate of my interests, they offered many choices in jobs, and did personal ability tests on me to show me just what job I could do and may be interested in. Yes the pay may be a little lower than what the job normally pays, but generally when you have been with a company for 90 days, the company will then hire you on full time with benefits. I worked for two different companies through Manpower and both after 90 days worked on the companies payrolls for 2 yrs on each. Its a good way to get your foot int he door at a good job."

Att kunna vara så adaptiv som möjligt har visats vara en egenskap som krävs inom varje arbetsplats och manpower har givit mig möjligheten att utveckla denna egenskap. Att vara på en arbetsplats en dag och sedan nästa dag vara på en annan med helt andra arbetsuppgifter utvidgade min kognitiva förmåga att snabbt kunna processera ny information och snabbt använda den praktiskt. Samtidigt som detta sker arbetar jag ständigt med nya arbetskollegor och det ger mig en bredare vy på hur arbetsmiljön fungerar, den svåraste delen med detta specifika arbete är just den ständigt ändrande arbetsmiljön men den har även vart den bästa delen utav arbetet."

good,"Recommend Manpower for anyone searching for employment; if you want a full-time permanent position, tell the Manpower associates.  If you want part-time temp, Manpower associates will assist you in any way that they can.  It has been very pleasant working for Manpower."
good,"Every company was different in going to work. I was able to jump into the position each and every time with easy, effortless and with confidence that I could show my diverse abilities"
good,This is great atmosphere to obtain many job onsite skills temporary for months or years of experience. Do advise they do not have any benefits no responsibility to your health or such they do just have skill set help which is great but this company regardless of how many referrals and recommendations you received do not care when you have a personal issue do not have your back you're replace with no hesitation.
good,"Temporary job service company - nice hours,  did not pay well and did not last long"
good,"sorted bad potatoes off a conveyor belt"
good,I didn't mind working for Manpower because the jobs were all temporary (even though some companies said they could lead to permanent). Wages varied but were reasonable. If the job wasn't as described you could request another company so I really enjoyed working for them.

good,Worked at Unilever as a Temp. The pay is good for the area and temp service.  Learned new things and was a good learning experience.

good,Typical day at work was Mon-Fri sing for all incoming packages ship all outgoing.
good,"The jobs were ok, it's just that I don't want factory work anymore."
good,They were very helpful in gaining employment quickly. If factories are your scene they do a very good job of achieving what you want. They pay pretty well depending on which manufaturing company they are able to send you to. Are understanding if something isn't working for you and try to help find shifts that work for your life.
good,"Quick, my experience at this branch was not the greatest experience but it was due to one employee who showed no interest in finding work for me. only giving me 2 to 3 day assignments"

good,Empresa com procedimentos sistematizados e organizada. Com visão claramente definida.
good,"Aprendí muchos sistemas para valorar carros, y administración general. En general como es una empresa familiar se tenía un sistema mas cómodo más relajado, la parte más difícil era al momento de hacer la nomina porque yo solo sabia que tenía que quitar algunos de los beneficios a los empleados y algunas veces no me explicaban el porque, aunque yo tenía que hacer nomina."
good,This is a very good company and some managers are great and some are not.  This was a good company that did a good job in compensating others but it depends upon management.
good,"Empresa dinâmica "

good,There are several great opportunities to advance and grow. The twelve hour shifts were great for my busy schedule. They did their best to work around my home life and Drs appointments

good,I really dont' think the company is dependable as far as providing good reliable employment. They don't check employers out enough to be sure they are legitimate before sending clients out.
good,"I answer the phone all day, taking calls from very angery people that wanted their money"
good,Manpower is a temp agency and they placed me quickly but they do not offer any compensation/benefits. i do like that they have direct deposit tho.
good,"Entraba a las 6:00 de la mañana , revisar mi unidad y el listado de clientes a visitar."
good,"received orders, processed orders for Baffin Inc.  answered phone calls, followed up on overseas shipments"

good,"I have developed skills inside of file room clerk and data entry in many ways while working for the companies of contractions.  I did File Room Clerk and some Data entry for company organizations.  While going to work the weather be dry, sunny, wet, rainy, cold and hummed while I am on properties of contractions.

When I was finished with that job, I would inspect everyone's work in my area to make sure each order was done correct then I would enter each order ( all the data) into the computer.I also worked in the stock room.

The employee I was to cover had very poor attendance and was not a good teacher.  I gave notice to leave because I planned on moving.  I did not end up moving so I am looking for another job.
good,They give the permanent position to the people they like if you are not well liked you will not advance so in other words kiss butt and you will get the great positions.

good,"I think that the Manpower people are good to work with. I have met no truly rude people there. I do believe that having to work a year before getting any kind of benefits through them (especially when the work is not temp-to-hire positions) is a bit of a screw over, but they do well in finding you something that you can do well and add to your resume so that you can find something permanent. And if you create great relationships and show great attendance at work, they will be a reference for any job you find outside of Manpower. It's wonderful."

good,We had the big Ericson Account; I preformed the testing and gave the orientations. It felt good to be a part of such a big part of my home town’s income source.

The repor with this company was always good. Working as a data entry clerk, office manger for home health, insurance jobs, receptionist, pbx operator were all excited and kept me busy during the day. However, I regret the closing of this office especially in this tight economy that we are all dealing with at this time. I was able to alway work the shift that I asked for and made satisfied with the rate of pay."
good,Awesome company to take temp to hire positions. Fair in the compensation for your work. Man power cares about it's employees. So far I've yet to come across as office manager that doesn't care about their employees.
good,I would always continue to recommend them. I've worked through them for many years. They go above and beyond to help eople get jobs. They stay calm when someone comes in unhappy.
good,"They sent me to a worksite that worked most holidays, and they also had a policy of x amount of hours before OT/holiday pay. I also found out it was an open ended temp to perm.

good,great referral sites not enough hours but helpful and efficient keeps me on assignment's and  keep generated leads for up and coming jobs communicated
good,I liked the environment where I worked it was easy going and fun.    It made is a more relaxed environment then I was used to and my stress level went down.
good,My  favorite part of the job is spending time with the co workers. You get to know them & treat them like they are your family. The hardest part of the job soreness of the feet standing 8 hours a day.

good,"Manpower is a great company to get work experience in, For me personally it was the IT field and so far the managers are all very understanding, the people you work with can be tough sometimes but mostly willing to help and teach you. I enjoy working here. Typical day is mostly involved with keeping the machines running and troubleshooting. I learned a lot about Linux systems and troubleshooting issues. The management has always been great. The culture is very laid back but demanding of work when it is busy, and it does get busy. Hardest part of the job is that you do face furloughs when it is not busy, and also when it is busy you will work 6 days a week anywhere from your typical 8 hour shift to 12+ hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is how relaxed most people are, there is not really much stress or headbutting. Everyone typically gets along fine."
good,Worked as a cleaner at various houses in Aalst and Denderleeuw. Very challenging to get houses to clean in the beginning but once you had your house you built a relationship with the owners

good,Manpower offers great employment opportunities that allow you to get your foot in the door at some of the big companies in the Lake County area. I would highly recommend this company.

good,"Typical working day: Set workload to complete."
good,I have enjoyed my experiences with Manpower. I needed full-time with benefits. Advancement is not part of Manpower. Benefits are not part of Manpower.
good,Get stores ready for their grand openings.  Installed fixtures and display build-outs.  Displayed merchandise to pre-pare the stores for the critical first impression with the retail customer.
good,"Manpower has variable places they can contract you to, and the enviroments are different. but, they look at the base facts (late, absent, complaints) if a company chooses to terminate your contract, and will assign you a new position as long as your base work is in good standing.  The company itself is a mix of manager types, but as long as you work, they work with you."
good,This job did not keep my mind as active as I would've liked. It was a simple dispatching job and a lot of the people who got hired on would not come in or quit as soon as they started. High turnover rate.
good,Worked just for the day thru manpower.                            I worked with the janitor clearing stumps and spreading hay at the Wells/Ogunquit High School fields.

good,"El mejor lugar para trabajar, altamente responsable con sus empleados, con excelentes herramientas para trabajar."
good,Basically just assembled radiators packed for shipment. Balanced work place. Hardest part was waiting when machines were down. Didn't move around to different positions to learn new machines
good,"I was hired for a 2 year long-term temporary position, and I loved it. The onsite management was just as friendly as the staff in the office at the temp agency."
good,It's a great place to start that offers that stepping stone where you can gain human resource skills and professional environment experience.Depending on which client / area you are located in there are different opportunities to grow but it is very hard to get hired onto the company and not be a contractor.
good,I was warned that unless you knew someone around here it was hard to get your foot in the door. Manpower got me in no problem. I went for my interview and the next week I was starting to work.
good,Working throught Manpower is a great learning experience.  The people are very helpful and willing to go the 'extra mile' for their clients.  A great pleasure to work with/through. The only problem would be is that it is hard to find the type of work I am looking for full-time administration.  Also I have moved out of the area.
good,"Manpower was great to work for as they are very professional, and also very nice. Unlike a lot of other temp agencies (Pro Staff),  Manpower will actually get their employees long term assignments, and with great hourly wages, and the jobs that they send you to are great too:)"
good,"I enjoyed my contract specialist, the hard part was the lack of benefits and the salary. The compensation was very low and made it difficult to continue with them, but they did help me secure my current job. I quite enjoyed working with my contract specialist as she was always a pleasure and worked hard to get the best for me!"
good,"was there for a short time. Was paid minimum wage for admin work which is very low but it was through a workforce program so that explains why. The workers and managers there were absolutely amazing. Friendly, and we all worked well together. I wish i could've been brought on full time. That was many years ago not sure how it is now."
good,Well it is temporary work and the jobes are temporary so you don't stay at just one job you do have the opportunity to get hired in at some of the jobesand the pay is not the greatest sometimes but it's nice they find work for you

Entrevisto a los que han faltado y descanso a los que tienen mas de dos faltas. Capturo mis bajas y mando los reportes a mis compañeras.

good,"It is hard to explain what I would do on a typical work day because I work for a temporary staffing agency but I will do my best to keep it in within the last year. Last November I worked for UPS in Chantilly VA as a Helper Coordinator, this job is only available during the holiday season. My job consisted of driver dispatch, learning the UPS tracking system, customer support and administrative duties. After that assignment ended I began to work at a company called Trico Lift. This company rented and sold construction equipment. My typical work day there consisted of customer support, creating rental contracts and work order for equipment as well as mechanic labor, truck dispatch as well as administrative duties. I was very close becoming permanent I worked there until corporate decided to close the branch. I ended back at UPS as a Helper Coordinator with the same duties as the year before.

It was at the time before Microsoft came out. Management at all different places were different, but generally very helpful, kind and patience with learning different areas of each company. Co-workers varied from company to company, but generally were nice and helpful. Hardes part of my job was going into strange places when assignments would end and learning new software.  The most enjoyable part of my various jobs was meeting all different people and learning how different companies operated. It gave me the change to work with multiple-age generations."
good,"I have learned a lot and gained a lot of clients. Can decide on my own with management's approval. Co-workers were all cooperative. Management is tough but this toughness will mold everyone to be productive and responsible. Sales & Marketing in UAE handles only by me so whatever outcome I may have, it's my own fruit. Enjoyed a lot with all the people around me."

good,"At EMC, the management would like always if the employees are safe in the workplace. For this purpose, the company provides some guidelines that can really help employees to feel safe when they are completing their daily assignments. Two breaks and a lunch times are scheduled for every 8 hours of work. Sometimes, the employees have called to stay two to four hours if needed or to work on some weekends to help the management to achieve the business goals. Most often at the end of the quarter, the company needs more people for one month assignment to hit the production target."
good,Every year  during Christmas time last weeks are the busiest ones.Every one feels under pressure. Managers are more strict than usually. ULD is the hardest part in my job.In 15 minutes the ULD is full.There is very short time to complete paper work of ULD and clear all bags from two assigned Chutes before the Chute lights are switched on and conveyor belt all bags jammed.Sometime i have to help to cover my other colleague lunch break. In spite of all this i like working at Royal Mail HWDC.
good,"Working for Manpower was great I was selected for different job assignments that would last from either 3 weeks to 6 months. Manpower offered me the flexibility I needed at that time due to family issues and still maintain a full time job. Management would always be a great help they made themselves visible at the job sites by coming out and interacting with their employees, asking questions about the job assignment and the staff at the job site. The hardest part about working for a temporary agency is that sometimes you meet great people and become very close in the time you are working with your co-workers and build a working relationship with them it becomes difficult to leave once the assignment end."

I learned how to use all kinds of office equipment and different ways that office personnel get along.  I really never worked with any of my co workers, they usually were on other assignments.  The hardest part was not knowing were anything was or who was who when getting phone calls.  The most enjoyable part was if I was sent to a site that the management was not pleasant, I usually didn't have to deal with them again.  (that only happened once, he had a really bad day and took it out on me)"

Management has been able to explain what is expected."

La parte mas difícil era cuando llegaba pedido pues armaba exibiciones muy grandes con tablas y decorarlas para una buena venta y muchas veces llegue a salir ya noche.

Every day start of shift with a meeting of the duties that had to be done for the job or the position each employee had to perform. After the meeting everybody would go to their positions to relieve the employees from the previous shift, from who we had a short talk on their day and how the machine had operated and what adjustments had to be done if any. Then after taking over the machine the relive operator for the day would try and get everybody their desired time for break/lunch/dinner. Getting along was really easy, but on rare occasions when things weren't going okay there would be a little tension. Dealing with angry coworkers, and being under pressure to go according to schedule where the hardest things to deal with. But overall it was really enjoyable working with everybody because we would get along so well and worked together to finish our job."

good,"Manpower isn't just a temp agency.  They also enter into long-term contracts with companies like IBM.  As a Manpower Associate you can run into some difficulties dealing with the IBM assistants as some view you as 'just a contractor' and sometimes this causes problems when the Manpower Associate is actually an IBM retiree.  As a Manpower Associate you also end up working from home rather than an office environment so you miss the 1:1 face-to-face interactions an office environment affords; not to mention, not everyone is cut out to work from home.  While Manpower does offer benefits, due to the low pay they've negotiated with the client - in this case, IBM - most Associates cannot afford them.  Also, any expenses associated with your job (i.e., internet/wifi fees, telephone charges, office supplies, etc.) are out-of-pocket expenses and NOT reimbursed."
good,"Gutes Arbeitsklima"
good,"At Manpower, I worked for several different companies in several different positions.  All of them were office based and fun to work at.  I served as a Receptionist, Secretary II at a Kids Mental Health facility, and as an office coordinator in the hospital.  The hardest part of the job is that it was all temp work.  Sometimes I didn't know if the job would be for one day, one week or a month.  All of the places I worked were enjoyable and I had the option of turning the job down if I didn't feel it was going to be a good fit. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends.  I was new to the area I worked in and it helped me make new connections and it helped me with networking to find a new, permanent job."

At times, the position was described as temp-to-perm, but if you were highly skilled and had a solid work history, permanent employees sometimes would feel threatened.  Pertinent information was not always shared due to this environment, which greatly affected thoroughness of work.  The management at Manpower was great and very responsive to assigning new positions.  But the temp-to-perm label was a misnomer.  You were at the mercy of co-workers."

good,"Manpower hired me to work at Estee Lauder in the fragrance production. It is so relaxing because it's easy work. My managers and supervisors are so wonderful. Manpower gives you the opportunity to a learning experience, and building you up by becoming inspired and motivated in what you are doing, and what you want to do in moving up to the next level. The one thing I don't care for is that you have to call the furlough line 90 minutes before you go into work. I'd like to have more time to find out if I'm working or not. Also, when the holidays come around, and the Estee Lauder mechanics want to take an excess amount of time off, the Manpower workers like myself don't work as well which can lead to 0 - 16 hours of work in that week including the chance of you being a furlough. I'm not sure, but I'm assuming this is Estee Lauder's rules since Manpower has teamed up with a variety of companies like Estee Lauder, Walmart, and so on. I know Walmart gives you a schedule to know what days you work. Manpower inspires and motivates me into moving up regardless of the pros and cons."

Revisar el presupuesto con el controller, por las contingencias que algunas veces debiamos tomar en cuenta. Mis relaciones con los ejecutivos bancarios eran muy importantes, mis colegas en general fueron muy buenos, trabajamos en equipo con amabilidad y respeto, mis decisiones eran acatadas. La gerente general, fue muy eficiente nos daba las pautas a seguir, nos reuniamos a considerar las metas semestrales y ver los aportes de cada area, aprendi a organizar y planificar mas a nivel gerencial, personalmente la gerente general, lidero un gran equipo de trabajo en tiempos de crisis de la empresa y del pais, por lo que gano mi admiracion y respeto.

good,"I had a great experience working for Manpower.  I was helped and placed through a couple different Manpower offices, and had success getting hired full-time by employers. Only thing I've noted over the years is the dwindling of contracts and the versatility of trying placements until one fits.  Temp jobs used to have that,  as a beautiful and attractive feature.  Not so much anymore. Lack of contracts limits my ability to try different spots until I find the right one for me. Seems now... if you don't fit, your stuck or  you're on the job search again."
good,"Very diverse company"
good,"En Manpower se me han pasado los meses de prácticas ""volando"". He aprendido mucho y he tenido unos compañeros maravillosos. La parte negativa ha sido el no poder continuar en la empresa."

good,"I spend a lot of time organizing and prepping myself to speak with candidates who are potentially seeking job opportunities. I have to make and navigate the google docs as well as excel, Microsoft office, and job adverts. Other tools I use involve utilizing 500 fortune company programs if needed and I've caught on by myself with no training. Not a lot of supervision so its easy to confidently set up my day where I can be successful and also collect commission at the end of the month.  I am steadily in the outlook folder while at the same time scheduling appointments, sending assessments, and conducting interviews with qualified candidates. The challenge as a recruiter from what I've learned is finding the right kind of candidate. The resume needs to be alluring but at the same time the primary focus is the experience and the way you ask questions using different case scenarios to see if they're a good fit, making it easier on the client to do the behavioral face to face interview with the people they want. I manage and train my own team as well as helping my clients in a crisis, whether thats doing additional work to fit their needs. "
good,I love having the opportunity to help place candidates in positions that they will hopefully excel at. At the same time it gives us the chance to find the perfect candidate for the client who has an opening.

good,Very easy people to work for. But there is no room for advancement and you do not have benefits until after you work there a year. Most people go to temporary companies with hopes of being hired with the company.

I applied for a specific job and was sent to an interview the same day and when i returned to thier downtown office after the interview I was informed that the job was mine.

good,"Arrived at work at 9am. Most of the staff were already present, having turned up early. Typical day involved giving people job advice, placing them in work, or scanning over their CV's. I learnt valuable admin skills, and IT skills such as using Vision, the in house database. My co-workers were friendly, and an efficient team to be a part of.

good,The only downside was that after working for two and a half years as a contract worker for Toyota Motor Manufacturing the economy failed and although being previously approved for permanent hire they froze a hiring and after waiting 6 months on unemployment I decided to get another job through Manpower.

Mi trabajo lo desarrollé en Home Center y la empresa siempre estuvo con un coordinador-visitador muy pendientes de cada una de mis dotaciones y sugerencias para desaroollar lo mejor posible mi labor...labor que iba muy de la mano con Sumicol la empresa que solicitó los servicios de Manpower para mi contratación. Los colegas en Home Center son personas muy amigables y colaboradoras, con ellos el trabajo en equipo fue un mano a mano que deja en mi mente un grato recuerdo.Lo más difícil creo fue el arduo trabajo que a diario terminaba siendo muy agotador pues manejaba referencias de Sumicol-Corona en casi todas las áreas del Almacén...pero fue una experiencia pese al cansancio muy grata con la compañía de los clientes, que en muchas de las ocasiones hacen de los trabajadores su mano derecha especializada."

good,"Manpower is a hiring company that does temporary and temp-to-hire positions with Vermeer as well as select other companies. My experience with both Manpower and Vermeer has been exceptional and at no time have I had second doubts about working with both companies. Vermeer is very driven to be about a respectful work environment at all times and always takes their employees as top priority. During a normal day of work I travel throughout the work area ensuring that all areas are well prepared for a full work day, as well as providing continued service throughout the day. I have had the pleasure of learning how to work efficiently a widely diverse group of coworkers and how to push through any potential difficulties that may occur in any given weekday. The management is always concerned about providing the best support they can to help everyone move forward and create the best production they can for Vermeer. I have had the ability to gain the friendship of many coworkers as well as create the most positive work environment possible for all employees. The most difficult part of the job would likely have been the beginning when I first started, as this was a different learning curve than what I had been previously used to. The work area relies on specific times to have things due, called ""takt-times"" which change every day and every week. Over a short period of time I had the ability to cope with the stress and speed required to meet the specific takt-times allowing the entire area to progress forward each week. I can easily say the most enjoyable part of the job is being able"

The people who work at the place I am assigned to (Sanofi) are friendly, hard working, and nice to be around for such long shifts. The hardest part about this job is how physically demanding it is. You have to be able to stand, crouch, lift, and walk for 10+ hour shifts and be available to work overtime on weekends as needed. Opportunity for overtime is great because the pay is already higher than most jobs around the area. Overall it is a great company to work for."
