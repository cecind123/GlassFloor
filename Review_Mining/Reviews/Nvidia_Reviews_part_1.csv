rating,review
bad,"Not worth it.. upper management treatments employee unfair. Manager and supervisor, constantly finding excuses to write people up. And terminate on first mistake"
bad,"Nvidia should take a deep considerations again manager who harassed, emotional abused, personal, hatred, jealous, against sick people while they are in need for medical attentions, force them to loose job, cut them off their insurance for medical support could lead to dead."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"I was working an unpaid internship, mostly for experience with some automation tasks. However after a week of bash scripting to check for memory leaks, I was forced to debug some orphaned code for their audio codec. This was when I quit."
bad,"Management can easily loose the temper without apology. It is expected to follow the order from the top without thinking. Management does not care about employees's grow and learning. In order to achieve their goal, manager can lie about the truth. Working environment is stressful."
bad,Highly recommended for intern and newly graduate.  Pay rate are low in hourly or salary.  Allow employees to transfer to different department if accept but manager can disapprove even got accepted by other department.
bad,If you like working for a zero-support and unhealthy workplace where people are waiting to jump on anyone who misspeaks about anything then this is the place for you.  Marketing driven and bro-like atmosphere.
bad,It was good working there I worked on SDM and SDO project. Both these projects were focused around optimizing the customer supply chain. The new tool which I learned was Tablue.
bad,"average company, so many contractor, not many regular employee"
bad,didn't enjoy my time here. Didn't have any opportunity to grow and expand my skills and knowhow. No support from management to get better at your job and contribute to new and innovative ways.
bad,"it is good for the gaining knowledge"
bad,"Bad: Little or no organization, very little processes, micromanaging management, managers who were great individual contributors but horrible people managers. Too political an environment."
good,This aw a very rewarding job for the first 12 years. The company changed and I have worked in several groups. My current group dosen't use my skill set. My current management is very poot
good,"Human resources was a mess. The management is out of touch with employees, making for an unpleasant work environment. Work life balance for the department was non-existent. We were expected to be available at all times. Management would say otherwise, but if you did not respond after hours, you were questioned about why."
good,They never hired their help desk techs. I worked with people who had been a contract employee for 5 years. The only way to move up was to be cool with the management. If you didn't go party with them you weren't going anywhere.
good,"dayjob, learned SAP, couple other systems, convincing internal stake holders for urgent requirements Vs cost savings is challenging part, flexible office time"
good,"The interns are not given any formal training. They are expected to learn things on the go and contribute at the same time. If someone lags behind, the management simply decides to give him insignificant work"
good,"Good to work for it but needs to be careful ad patient, learned a lot from  group, and encouraged by manager to get better."
good,"It is a great company to work for if one can grapple with breeding politics and toxic culture.  very strong management but VPs are more interested in forming concentric rings of favorites versus outsiders,  so if you are on the inner circles, you are safe, if not, then it is a matter of time.  Great health benefits, pay raise is nominal, RSU nominal,  Project management is non-existant, decision making is weak and delays often becuase roles are not well defined.  in many cases loud noises were more effective than logical reasoning"
good,"Der Mitarbeiter kann die Arbeitszeit in Abstimmung mit dem Kunden und dem internen team selber einteilen.  Tools wie email, chating platforms und Handy helfen dabei."
good,"- Working strategy is good but not so good"
good,"Quite demanding and always under tremendous pressure to challenge status quo. Nevertheless, it's very rewarding environment for the super-achiever employees."
good,"There are always new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. But the pay is low compared to other organizations in the domain. "
good,"Distributed development teams result in a busy day of meetings, video conferences and emails.  Managing issues and directing cross functional team on a daily basis.  Interacting with operations to progress reliability and automotive qualification test plans and new product test solution development strategy."
good,"Compensation is at or above market.  The company provides competitive benefits, except for the 401K, which is not comparable to other large companies.  Compelling technologies and products."
good,"NVIDIA is well positioned because of its presence in GPUs, High Performance Computing, AP & Mobile Connectivity to take advantage of opportunities in Automotive world. "
good,Fun place to get your technical experience.  Lots of challenging project.  Management seems a bit fragmented and lacks a cohesive vision.
good,6 days work in a week. Learned basic computer repairing and software installing.Management was good as we can choose our break time. No much co-workers senior technician and boss.Hardest part is when things arrived and need to get ready in 1 day. The enjoyable part is learning new things and first time experiencing was fun.
good,Constant firefighting in a complicated Linux environment.  Including all aspects of troubleshooting LFS job sceduler and underlying Linux and NFS environment.
good,highly motivated and capable engineers.  Management in some divisions can be quite challenging.  The perks here are definitely limited compared to top companies like Google.
good,"No time restriction or logging in of any sorts. Only thing that matters are deadlines with added in quality of end product. Plenty facilities such as free transport, free food from breakfast till dinner. Employee favorable Stock option plans. Competitive work environment to keep you motivated with lots of new learning and versatile areas of work to explore. In house training programs to help develop new technical skills."
good,"Nvidia is a good work place. It's centrally located close to 101, and 280 freeway."
good,"If you are lucky, you will be working with some of the best software engineers in the world! The like is like ping pong. Sometimes it is too busy sometimes there is all the time in the world to do your work."
good,"NVIDIA's culture does not allow for worklife balance.  There is to much politics and a tremendous amout of micro management.  If you have a life and desire to spend time with your family, NVIDIA is not the place for you.  The culture is old school with an average age in the 40s, you won't find any free snacks or lunch.  But, dinner is always free because they want you to stay late.  However, their benefits are top notch."
good,"I have been in Nvidia for a little more than a year now. It is a great company to work. It gives you scope to learn and grow. It is flexible in terms of work and timing. If you want to work need not worry, it will find you. I am lucky to be in one of the best teams in Nvidia and so far I have no complaints. The co-workers are fun to work with and some of the brightest minds."
good,"good enviroment to work, had chances to work at different departments, friendly place, not much to learn, not much chance to get hiring as permanent, not a security job, no benefits"
good,"Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale."
good,The company is very far-sighted with a strong position in both graphic markets as well as in AI market. They are very aggressive in terms of compensation.
good,Nvidia has a strong work-life balance culture. Working here was fun when we would all go all play video games at times. Work culture is very agile and an individual is expected to perform without much support.
good,Good place to work. Have good exposure towards NVIDIA products and will have hands on experience with the graphics cards and other products. A calm place to work
good,"My work team was a great environment for me, lots of collaboration and focus on doing whatever it took to get the job done and going outside of typical responsibilities.  Unfortunately, due to some internal politics, our group was disbanded.  It was a lot of fun to be part of Silicon Valley company with aggressive release targets, though at the same time very stressful."
good,I was only a contractor but still was able to enjoy the many perks of working at Nvidia.  They definitely do their best to promote from within.  Cafeteria options were very  nice.
good,"Management is off hand which provides personal growth "
good,Ambien genial con la gerencia sin ningun problema podias aportar ideas
good,"Nvidia is one of the biggest companies in Pune and offers probably the best salary in that city. The work culture is good, flexible timings, but most employees do not show up for work till almost 11am. Since the day starts late for most employees, it ends as late at 9pm (9pm would be considered an early day I suppose)."
good,"Nice work culture, helping co workers."
good,"Being a satellite office in Toronto, the area is definitely on the smaller side, but the office has a startup feel to it because of the small number of employees working together in the building."
good,"Great workplace with no micromanagement. "
good,It took too long for me to be rotated into a fulltime employee and once that happened a new VP came in with other ideas and got rid of people that he felt were not necessary.
good,Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!
good,"> New technology exploration"
good,"As a QA engineer a typical work day would be executing test plans on the release BSP. Designing new test plans ."
good,"A few positives: well respected CEO, collaborative workplace culture,  cutting edge technology, excellent compensation and employee benefits, community involvement."

good,The 12-14 hours go by flying and still feel there's a lot more to do.
good,"Despite going in with no prior experience with the testing procedures, I was able to learn everything and much more in my time here. The management is very accommodating and encourages you to learn new skills."
good,"It was okay, not bad. The typical nine to five hour was okay. It's great travel since it's near a TTC station. Though almost everythign has to be NDA."
good,"One of the best places to work at. Treats employees as people and not just resources to be exploited. Jensen, the CEO, is funny and inspirational!"

good,NVIDIA is a great place for innovation and vision. Jensen drives direction from the top down. The organization is very matrix and it's really about working cross functionally. The most enjoyable part is the people. The hardest part is the amount of work given the resources.

good,"Good environment for Innovation and fully supported by the Top Execs."
good,"I have been a specialist for 3 years now and it's very hard to get promoted as a campaign manager. I have worked in many different departments and have shown success. They want to keep the organization flat, which is great because I have visibility to many departments and work with VPs, but I don't feel I'm being nurtured as a young person to be set up for success down the road. "
good,"Since working as a contractor, didn't know when they would let us go.  This is always a challenge when you're not a permanent employee.  But I'm still open to temporary or permanent work."
good,"Maintain the Data Center, running fibre , set up and install of basic routers and switches, install bsic windows servers and remote support systems, manage monitoring all data center equipment."
good,Nvidia is a place where you constantly learn new things. You have ownership and that makes you responsible for your success and failure to meet the product deliverables.

good,"fats paced, intelligent people, good food. sometimes a gap in communication"
good,"A typical day at work: Fix bugs, work on feature enhancements"
good,"Excellect Workplace where u encounter amazing minds , very helpful for learning , interaction with amazing engineers "
good,"Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better."
good,Management needs to step up though in understanding developer needs and bringing more challenging work in the team.

good,"This was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry."
