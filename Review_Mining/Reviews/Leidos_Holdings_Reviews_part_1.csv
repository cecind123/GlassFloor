rating,review
bad,"In my department, there is no advancement or annual compensation. The management in place in my department runs it as a dictatorship and never listens to your ideas. There is supervisor in place that has never supervised anyone in his life. The environment is toxic and no good schedule options."
bad,They expect you to give free time without thought to what may be going on in your life and if you work your 40 and leave you are verbally chastised for in front of others.
bad,"Terrible contract, no support, everything centers around money. It was a complete waste of effort and time.  Even if you make suggestions on how to make improvements if there is no profit attached then it will go nowhere."
bad,"poor mgmt in chesapeake va."
bad,"The job was not what I thought. The people were nice but the management was not compatible. It was not the best working environment, to say the least. I am sure there is more to the company but my experience was not the best."
bad,"I will never work for Leidos Inc., in the Omaha area ever.  At all levels of management was dishonest to employees.  it was a very hostel and uncomfortable work environment."
bad,"Lousy benefits, no option for advancement, absolutely no corporate culture, no leadership structure, poor pay, revolving door of unappreciated employees and turnover."
bad,"Leidos is managed by people who do not care about your future, just their immediate gains. Unrealistic expectations, no guidance and all blame falls on the worker."
bad,"The reason why I am seeking a new job is because of my dissatisfaction with this company.  My employment was due to a buy-out.  Since the new position, Leidos has (a) increased the cost of my health care, (b) reduced the bereavement leave time from 3 days to 1 day, (3)  has taken away ALL sick-leave, and (4) now requires any leave (i.e. sick, bereavement and vacation) to be charged to accrued vacation time.  Vacation time, now called ""Personal Time Off"" (PTO) remained unchanged (i.e. did not absorb the now taken-away sick and bereavement leaves).  In other words, if I previously had 100 hrs of vacation time, 10 hrs of sick leave and 36 hrs of bereavement leave, the new system retains the vacation time only, forcing vacation time to be used for sick, vacation and bereavement times - all unadjusted."
bad,"Deceptive hiring practice.  Presented with one the option to work 1099 ,but resend offer upon final hiring. This stunt was presented after you made plans to travel to customer site."
bad,"great company, good people, work is enjoyable.  I would for them again.  I was too far away from my home in Mass so I decided to leave when I was approached by P&W."
bad,"This contract is under extension, so don't look for any benefits. If you're a serious safety or manager don't take this job, the safety position is a scam, and the managers are a bunch of bullies. There is no ""Safety Program"", and the status quo is there's nothing wrong. The safety manager doesn't manage anything but is the vassal of production and is expected to just check fire extinguishers with productions wishes.  This attitude goes right up the chain, so don't look for any backup from your manager, HR, or corporate safety.  But if you want to sit in the office and collect a paycheck, power to you."
bad,People that end up working here never ever get fired but always quit and find better places to work or places that pay their worth.  I currently work here and I regret the decision
bad,Consistently lied to and about by Sr Management.  Did not keep promises and ignored talent within their organization.  Consistently placed people in a no win situation and would then blame them when something went wrong.  Would give unethical directives and when the customer found out they would use you for the scape goat and terminate your employment.  Tried to do too much with too little and expected people to put in 60 to 80 hours a week.
bad,"Not the same SAIC envirnomane your use to. This is a numbers only company and the benefits are not great, all management is poor and I would not recommend"
bad,Only care about money not the staff. Laid good workers off because of outsourcing and greedy managers. ...............................................
bad,"Despite countless complaints to the anonymous ethics line and HR, issues with management span 18+ months. Half of the team have left and been replaced with subcontractors. Staff is miserable. Since client is happy - the contracted staff's happiness is not a concern by anyone."
bad,"Pros- fed holidays off"
bad,There is a culture of reverse discrimination where minorities receive extreme preferential treatment.  Lay-off occur randomly and without clear performance basis.  Example:  Last person hired on a team gets laid off if the manager doesn't meet the budget.  Very hypocritical public advertising...
bad,Company does annual performance reviews but does nothing with them. I have never received a pay raise and the customer that I  support has been extremely pleased with my work.
bad,Regret joining it.it's been only a month and I am already actively looking for another job. it sucks to work for such unprofessional group.If possible avoid it.
bad,Watch you back.  Back stabbing is common place.  Management does not protect the staff.  Workload is heavy and training is minimal.  Expectation is that you can figure it out on your own.
bad,"As with any corporate environment, you work in a cubby and are expected to work and not talk. Management is very much about the buddy system, so if you're in good you will promote. This is widely known throughout the Tucson organization as they prefer to hire family and friends. Management is not often trained in the departments in which they manage."
bad,company does not care about there employees and treats you like you are a robot
bad,"No. comment. Do not wish to comment."
bad,"Manager's don't have a clue what boots on the ground are experiencing, all they want is to cut costs to include your salary.  I don't recommend them as an employer."
bad,"If you are smart or have advanced engineering degrees, don't work here. The only thing that works here is being in the clique. They discriminate against women engineers and promote the male engineers who are part of the clique. They have unethical business practices and commit contract fraud with the Federal government and does not care. They are the worst employer.  Stay away or you will face the same treatment especially if you are a female engineer who is smart."
bad,"They needed people for a one year contract and the people they hired, including the subs, were told it was a 5 year contract. HR has not tried to place any Leidos people anywhere."
bad,"Leidos does not deserve to hold the prime contract in McLean, and I genuinely hope the company will fail in the recompete for R3. The corporate culture needs serious work."
bad,"Ageist environment t"
bad,"Don't work at Leidos. Terrible management, underpaid and creates a negative environment to work there. Morale has gone down since I've been there. I make less there now than I did a year ago. Worst Ever."
bad,"A high employee turnover rate, the rate at which employees leave a business, can affect the bottom line of businesses of all sizes. Because employees who are satisfied with their jobs generally don't give them up, high turnover is usually indicative of a problem."
bad,"Since split from SAIC, management has taken several steps to change the direction of the company without consideration of final impacts.  Too much work and not enough people to complete it with efficiency."
bad,"LeidosHealth, is the outcome of the merger of MaxIT, VCS and SAIC. Prior to the merger, my rating of the above, would have been 4-5 stars. But, post acquisition LeidosHealth stopped caring about it's workforce. Changing benefits to employee populations during open enrollment, which lacked transparency and felt shady on many levels. This company doesn't even offer the basic benefits most employers offer: STD, LTD, Life, etc was all cut and announced during open enrollment."
bad,"One of the worst companies (especially I.T. field related) I've ever had the displeasure of working for.   Totally seeming unlawful practices as far as wages and hiring.  Every one I worked with was paid differently for doing the same job and this wasn't based any way on skill, output or tenure.  I was quickly promoted to doing more work like interviews, writing training articles etc with no additional pay or compensation which I stepped down from.  Constant lies from management or blatant disregard for concerns brought up by analysts.  No one is being properly compensated at this location while management makes a killing for not even managing.  I wouldn't advise anyone I know or dont' know to work for these clowns."
bad,"The current Program Manager (I will not name him) who's been stuck in the same position in LEIDOS since 2007 is incompetent, corrupt, and dangerous to the security of the the United States of America (I will explain below how).  Everyone in the company has gone up the corporate ladder and he is STILL stuck at the same position.  He will not defend his employees no matter how hard they work, how many languages they speak, and what kind of higher education degrees they hold.  In Jan 2019, LEIDOS won the current contract in Bethesda.  Because there was a friction between DLI students (unqualified military linguists, who FAILED to learn a language at Defensive Language Institutes, which our tax payers paid $150,000 a year per student).  Because of their failure to complete the jobs they were hired for (TRANSLATING), they are ALL (13+) have been AWARDED with promotion to non-linguist positions and managerial positions with HIGHER PAY! (If they were UNABLE to learn a language in 12 months at DLI, what makes you think they can MANAGE or complete other complex tasks)"
bad,"You have no career path, and management does not care about you. You spend no time at a Leidos facility or at any company events. Benefits aren’t great."
bad,Company fully funded by a Ministry of Defence contract so all employees are treated like cattle. Unless you are an ex military white male employee do not expect any career advancements. Three years in and still lack of established processes. Poor communication between management and staff. Lot of nepotism in certain teams resulting in poor quality recruitment yet these employees with minimal skills fly through probation. Staff openly bullied in front of colleagues and often in front of the customer.
bad,"Pretty much your typical large corporation.  they are very top heavy and put alot of pressure on lower management to produce numbers which in turn creates a stressful work enviroment in most sectors. "
bad,The management here don't know what they're doing and care very little about the workers.  Management is very clicky.  Work here is pretty boring and is mostly done hurry up and wait fashion.
bad,"Log-in to a work station, upload any and all information needed to be translated. Translate and transcribe all necessary information. Proofing, editing, and quality control of all completed translations and transcriptions."
bad,The pay was terrible. The lay off happened via an email with zero notice! Their was absolutely no redeployment support. Not to mention  that management lost multiple contracts due to incompetence by being to expensive!!
bad,Yo get thrown under the bus for doing what u are asked to do.  Culture is cut throat and working for management involves not working for people.  In other words all below you are disposable otherwise you become disposable!
bad,I choose not to reply or share information in this matter.  It would not be in my best interests to speak negatively about this company or my position - thank you.
bad,"In the Frederick MD VCMP plant, the environment was told to me that it was ""family-like"", which really means the team is a family that doesn't appreciate outsiders or outside thought.  Any ideas that don't align with how things are currently done is completely disregarded, at best, or outright mocked, at worst."
bad,"Leidos Health has lost it's focus on it most critical assets, its people.  Without people to provide the consulting services that generate Leidos Health's revenue the company will soon find itself unable to compete in the market."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Dishonest and misled by Executives  in the interview, on-boarding and day to day management. Poor communication and refusal to share strategic plans - they plan in the the corner office and then don't understand why none of it works. They rule by dictate not collaborate."
bad,"Due to the nature of the company and the field in which I found myself working, stability within the company was an issue.  Such is government contracting."
bad,"I was a Patient Care Coordinatior at NIH. Excited to start this journey with a new contractor, but unfortunately things went left. I was let go for not having the “qualified experience” I felt disappointed with the company for not giving me a chance. Also, felt like it was a conspiracy. I felt like the other PCC who was training me didn’t give me a chance and must not like that I was very outspoken. I felt like that may been the reason was let go. The CMRP Supervisor for the PCC department doesn’t fight for you nor have your back. Horrible organization and professionalism. Good luck to next person who embarks this awful journey of a company. Just be alert and have your OWN BACK."
bad,Leidos is an ever changing company that does not value solid employees. The work environment is quiet and people keep to themselves. Not a collaborative or fun place to work.
bad,"The pace went from relaxed one day to frantic the next at the supervisor’s bipolar whim."
bad,"The pay is very decent as well as the job work/life balance, education reimbursement, and health care benefits. But you do have to ask yourself are these perks worth the poor management."
bad,"""Employees are the most important resource"" - As stated by the CEO once the Lockheed Martin spin-off was merged with Leidos. What a bunch of hot air! It's not seen in the actions of the benefits for employees."
bad,Program manager is a joke. Benefits are too expensive for the pay you receive. No advamcement unless you are in the program managers click! Please don’t waste your time
bad,"Repetitive day in day out....clique-y, comfortable...free coffee and small gym on-site, strict parking....CEO is too smart for his executives...average benefits."
bad,Received no training from coworkers as the older coworkers were afraid of losing there jobs to new hires. Had to learn my job through trial and error.
bad,great company to work for and would work for. Ledios makes sure you are taken care of with the client and also make sure everything is going well through your project.
bad,"The Leidos Management team consists of unprofessional men who think they’re still in the Navy.  They encourage cut throat behavior, and cliques will sit for hours and do nothing.  Rampant nepotism, and retaliation for not staying quiet. Stay clear of this company."
bad,"Little to no organization. A lot of wasted time and meaningless work in between traveling. While on the job in the field, technicians are used for long hours and not given breaks or any kind of schedule structure."
bad,Leidos does not provide benefits or raises to its contract employees. The work hours are long. The job is decent enough but the pay is 1/4 of industry standards.
bad,"I worked for this company for 7+ years, through all of the name changes. It was GREAT before SAIC took over, and all of the things that made MaxIt/Vitalize an excellent company went away."
bad,"Supervisors do not know the job of employees under them."
bad,Company management style like military. don't have correct communication channel with your manager. It is not friendly company to work with too much of corp polity.
bad,"Negative environment & negative, Fake, uncaring people that complain too much... horrible!!!!  Very unprofessional & extremely unorganized... They only care about you if you have been there for many years....  No job security... don’t waste your time!!"
bad,Most days were spent trying to decipher what management wanted. No support from PM when dealing with government needs. Workplace culture was stressed due to management micromanagement.
bad,"Colleagues enjoyable to work with. Management distant & disconnected. Poor communication across entire enterprise. Internal Website is not very user friendly, really need to hunt for specific data/information you are concerned with."
bad,"the employees were bullies and liked to tease in very childish and unprofessional ways. management was indifferent to complaints and often appeared to encourage the behaviors. very hostile environment to work in because of all the nepotism going on the bulling was often coming from different employees with no fear of consequences. Promotions and bonuses were guaranteed if you participated in the bulling which created a very hostile and stressful work environment if you were the target of such harassing behavior. The health benefits were too expensive, the deductibles were high and provided inadequate coverage. however the pay was good but not enough to tolerate the bad behavior from other employees."
bad,"Cheap "
bad,At Leidos - if you take any PTO - you will not receive your bonus for that quarter. You are penalized for using PTO. The bench policy is very measly. Only assured 30 days and if no assignment you can be let go. Also must answer you phone within an hour or email with 2 hours or you are non compliant and will not receive pay for the bench time. There is no orientation at all. Some online course that wasn't established yet.
bad,"I am sure if you work at the home office, its a real hoot. But since Leidos is a defense contractor, many employees are hired on a per contract basis. Many more work over seas. As one of these folks, plan on being treated as nobody. Plan on HR ignoring you. And plan on your stateside boss being completely disconnected from you out in the field doing what essentially is making money for the company."
bad,"Leidos Europe Ltd is running a 13 billion pound LCST programme for the UK Government. This sounds like a brilliant opportunity, sadly due to the way the company is funded (i.e. by the Programme of work for the MOD with no financial support from it's US parent corporation)."
bad,"One of the few development groups that produced a releasable baseline on a monthly basis."
bad,"Government funded job ( contractor ) has seen major decline in the last 4-5 years.  Management is not up to par,  well below average."
bad,"At Leidos, you definitely feel like you're a part of a big money-making machine that's all about advancing the company's objectives but not necessarily in the interest of its employees. While compensation and fringe benefits may have a been a plus, the corporate culture did not feel as if employees were considered the company's assets but rather just a tool to increase the bottom line."
bad,Inept management and long time lazy and complacent employees make it difficult to work here. Lots of racism and retaliation also from management. I would stay far away.
bad,"A typical work day involves being tasked, then re-tasked, then told that you should have been doing something else.  Who your actual boss is, always a question.  Idiots in Operational Management roles that can't process themselves out of a paper bag.  Nepotism, cronyism and poor PM decision making processes."
bad,"No one to turn to when problems come up. HR says all the right words, but does nothing. Basics of management not performed, allowing problems to fester. No follow up, employee must initiate all conversations. Attitude of mgmt is do whatever, put up with whatever, just don't rock the boat. Overt discrimination tolerated. Verbal abuse of Leidos employees by government employees ignored. Hostility if you request earned time off, HR does nothing to address."
bad,Leidos prefers to promote and advance internal employees with little to no qualifications and pay them less $$ instead of promoting a qualified professional.
bad,Poor Management and micro managing they have no structure built in place and the employees aren't willing or able to complete a daily job. You have to constantly stay at them every minute to complete what they should be able to do.
bad,"The employees are very bright, motivated, and talented. But upper management has essentially destroyed company culture."
bad,The recent awards given this company as a good place to work are a joke. Just last week more reorganizations were announced and more good employees laid off. The new management couldn't care less about its employees. They reorganize and move jobs without any thought of long term loyal employees who will lose their jobs.  Minorities and women are rarely considered for senior positions and they tout their veteran hiring which is typical ex-military white males placed in the senior leadership roles that can influence the government customers to further their own agendas. They will lay off 20 plus year emoloyees that are close to tetirement with higher salaries and avoid paying out unvested accounts and options to save a buck.
bad,"As long as you are billable, the management never reaches out to you. When you are not billable (on the bench) you only hear from management to let you know when your bench time will end."
bad,"I worked for a small department in a large company and I felt insignificant the whole time I was there. The whole time I worked there, I was micromanaged every step of the way. Every minute was tracked and employees in my department were equated to nothing but profit margins and billable hours. I understand that it is a business but employees are more than profits."
bad,"The Company is like any other large company.  they treat you like a number, or  you are not a real human...  was great when it was a small company maxIt but that was long ago.  All the family values have changed"
bad,I started with this company it was call MaxIT a family owned business - a fantastic company to work for.  A year and a half later the owner sold out and the company merged with another smaller consultant company (Vatalize) .  Six months later these two merged companies were bought by SAIC and they split off the healthcare consultant business as a public traded company called Leidos Health.  Leidos is struggling as a company and has laid off 35 to 40 % of there work force.
bad,Leadership and ethical mischief everywhere. Losing money on many sections. A very big obvious divide between older and younger generations on an hr level is constant.
bad,"Management  seems to disconnected from the teams. In this age they practice nepotism, if you are part of the clique you get rewarded. Ask managers a question they tell you to call HR. The air inside the building is dirty and several times employees have had to be evacuated due to fumes or chemicals and carbon monoxide from the tenants  on either side.  On one occasion an employee had to call the fire department because management would not call even thou people were getting sick with the fumes. Other occasions you have to work thru the fumes that permeate the building. The 2 small bathrooms do not seem to have ventilation and it feels like your are in an indoor latrine. Put in for time off for doctors appointments or other time off and they tell you all slots are full. Never mind the government shut down which caused many to lose all the accumulated time in order to get paid. Leídos  seems to be clueless and it’s all about the client and I understand that but there are humans working there. It feels more like sweat shop than a place of work."
bad,"Managers were very flaky and hard to get in contact with. If you are an off-site employee, expect to wait to hear back. If you are an on-site employee expect to be scrutinized and watched by a Gestapo-like inner group. My first 4 years there I had 4 different managers. There was very little continuity and was told my pay would increase based off the US Governments payscale of the SCA."
bad,"Working at Leidos, like any large company, are bound to have ""people"" issues. Since I've been here, I've seem many ppl leave DHMSM program every month. Morale is low, I kept hearing. I say ""hello"" to the program mgr. He frowns at me in response-nice! My mgr micromanages me to a point where I have no autonomy, not trusted to make any decisions, criticized for anything I say & do and don't even do what I was originally hired to do a year ago. I asked my mgr for a letter of recommendation to satisfy my grad college app. He coudln't be bothered. This is Leidos? Really? Your experience in any company will largely depend on the type of manager you will have, who may be great, so-so or just terrible."
bad,The company is very driven by the government contracts that it has and the government customers that manage those contracts.  The benefits and salaries are limited to make the company more competitive in the government contracting arena.
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job was knowing the type of work Leidos was completing for our country's safety."
bad,"Not a good environment to work in.  No support, from your team leader and you are asked to do more than what you hired in for."
bad,"Leidos does not care about their employees. I've seen them try their best to keep it a secret until the last minute when they planned on laying people off. There was no reason for it. They continuously cut benefits. They do not hire management based on talent, instead it's based on who knows who. When they do a bad job they just move them to another project. Do your self a favor and keep looking for work elsewhere."
bad,"I work for Leidos as a contractor. My first contracting job. Not happy with it. No job security. Contractors are treated like step-kids. Leidos' interest is their client - the government. Government pays top dollar for contractor services (they're interested in contractor skills, not giving them health benefits) Leidos gives employees a fraction of what they're paid. Contractor gets played on both ends - by the government and Leidos. Better to have a job that pays good money and cares enough about employees to also provide health benefits. Leidos provides benefits but robs you on salary."
bad,"Upper management speaking good morale and promoting science, but in fact the organization is not working due to mid management's lack of leadership and their favoritism towards some employees."
bad,"Leidos Health is a consulting company to work with.  We have a very supportive network and on line training program for areas such as project management."
bad,"Recent split of Leidos from SAIC has been traumatic. New CEO may turn things around, but existing management seems out of its element and more concerned about trying to stay on Wall Street's good side rather than retaining good employees. Unsure of where the company should be going. Bonuses and other incentives have dried up in the last few years and the company has lost it's way. Some parts have wonderful clients and profitability, but other parts have been allowed to deteriorate as the best people have left for greener pastures. Offices typically don't coordinate or know what other offices do. Very poor training support except for a few identified high fliers who often leave shortly afterwards for better positions elsewhere. No defined career paths for most positions, so employees stagnate doing the same thing for the same clients over and over. Generally well qualified and bright people, but they aren't being well utilized or nurtured."
bad,It was a great company to work for before the company was bought out by a larger corporation.
bad,"When the company was Vitalize the recruiters, practice managers and mangers were all great. They communicated with you regularly and were available whenever you needed them. They offered great jobs, pay, work advancement opportunities with additional certification, etc. I was put on a contract right away and promised I would have a chance to get additional certification for every year I was working. Once my contract ended after 4 months I was on the bench for 3 weeks before a friend of mine who was on a contract told me about an opportunity available. They wanted to interview so I notified Vitalize and we made it happen and I ended up getting the contract. I was able to keep my hourly rate and was told I would still have opportunities for additional certification and future rate increases. Shortly after I started that contract the company merged with MaxIT and then a short while later (with several changes in staff and policies) they became Leidos. Over the 2 1/2 yrs I was on this contract I was never given the opportunity to receive additional certification and I never once had a review of my work (although I was continually told it would happen) to get an increase in pay. My billable rate during my contract was $134/hr  and I worked a lot of hours with little to no vacations. I figured I made Leidos over $180,000 in my 2 1/2 yrs. Thats a lot of money to make off of one individual over a period of time, especially when all they did was use a system I input my exopeses into to get reimbursement, cut me a check and give me dental and vision insurance. Once my contract ended at"
bad,"The project level staff are mostly superb, with a fair diversity of GIS knowledge from beginning to senior. There are many co-workers willing to help out when you need it, and most people are friendly and personable. I enjoy the people I work with very much, and its one of the best parts about working in my office."
bad,"Management was really nice, but overall unresponsive to concerns. The two teams I worked on were very independent and small, mostly staffed with new college hires. Overall, there was too little seniority and experience within the development teams and seniors were unreachable."
bad,Leidos Is a great place to work . It has its pros and cons like any other job. Leidos can be somewhat unorganized but tend to still get the job done. That’s it
bad,"Not everyone pulls their own weight.  Benefits were terrible, not enough pay or time off.  Personal Time and Vacation time were lumped into the same basket of 9 days per year.  Not every employee was funded for the full work year."
bad,"Its difficult when you have leadership who has no education in the department they manage.  They had their favorites and if you weren't it then that was it, you were marked.  They have a high turnover rate and were steady taking on more work before understanding what they had already took on.  It was organized chaos."
bad,"Several business activities and processes in this company need to go through a Lean Management/Six-Sigma process to establish true business needs related to Sarbanes-Oxley and IT Governance.  Wasted processes are not preventing flawed applications from being promoted, instead they hinder rapid corrections when post-deployment issues are identified.  The culture needs overall maturity to attain what is the best result rather than for what is done first or cheapest.  Excessive thrift or governance in the wrong areas while under-governance in other critical areas is wasting  and not saving money and resources."
bad,Lackluster managers that only care about the bottom-line numbers while not taking into account the behind-the-scenes tasks to get the job done. Compensation is a lot lower than the competitors because they are consider the white elephant in the room.
bad,"Leidos (formerly SAIC prior to company split) is one of the many Beltway Bandits that lives and dies by acquisition. If you are an accomplished acquisition manager you can thrive here, but if not, all other jobs are suspect unless you are one of the chosen few that have been selected to go through the Corporate Leadership Program. These trained Kool-aid drinkers will become senior management and implement the acquisition strategies, maintaining the newly acquired contracts and staff as long as they can meet corporate revenue and profit goals. When these contracts expire, recompetes are lost, or more profitable acquisitions are merged into the conglomerate all prior acquired staff are laid off and the autonomous game begins again with the SAME EXACT senior management staff. They advertise a job placement system, but in my 10 years with SAIC/Leidos I never saw anyone successfully placed in any other position."
bad,There is nothing enjoyable about working for this company. They do nothing to incentivize talented individuals and try to keep them for dirt cheap.
bad,Leidos is a large company.  Management proficiency is a mixed bag.   Sneior managment is more concerned with short term stock price gains and place less emphasis employee welfare and longer term vision.
bad,"Benefits are alright. They offer three healthcare plans, vision, and dental. The 401k match is 50% up to the first 6%, so they'll match 3%. There are also a few other benefits offered I elected not to take such as pet insurance, additional life insurance, and a pretax childcare spending account."
bad,"Leidos offers its employees less PTO, worse benefits, and significantly less management support than other companies offer their staff under the same contract."
bad,"The contract lasted only two weeks when the client informed me that they are switching direction.  I was constantly in meetings with managers who repeatedly asked the same questions due to lack of technical expertise but still wanted to control the software development.  "
bad,Leidos is very bad at low balling employee salaries. I work as a contractor for the Army and my peers worked for LNO contracting company. LNO would pay their empoyees over $10k more a year to do the same jobs.
bad,"When I started with the company, it was very welcoming and interested in helping all of us in our careers. However, recently the culture has changed so that money is the only important thing, far more important than people. Money is good though, they've become a typical government contractor."
bad,Long hours starting very early at the office each day. Some co-workers are good yet others are just there to draw a paycheck and do  nothing.
bad,"Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), it offers the opportunity to improve the lives of people through medical research. I worked for the company for over ten years  and could not wait to retire.The company has seen the best managers and directors leave, and the new leadership has slowly destroyed the company. Even outside contractors are reluctant to work with the company. Management displays a lack of respect for the experience, training, and aptitude of it's employees."
bad,"Company is a mess.  In the middle of a transition where one hand didn't know what the other was doing.  Actually laid off for ""lack of work"" and then my manager took a demotion and took my job."
bad,"Just do your work and you will be fine that is all you need to do."
good,Terrible company to work for.  No job security and upper management incapable of caring for their employees.  Harassing and discriminatory environment.
good,"Co split from SAIC. Problem is that UNLESS they get rid of management, they still act like SAIC and you constantly hear, ""that's how we did it"". Problem is, they are not making money so everyone takes a chance with their job with layoffs while upper management still tries to pretend they are a new and different company. Benefits are ok but nothing to brag about. They contribute to 401K; however, if you lose employment within 5 years, they take back their contributions -- what???? Healthcare has very high deductible. For a company this size, should have better choices available. Difficult to work with people who were SAIC employees as they do not know how to do things differently. All I heard was, we did it this way and management would not support you if you went outside the box. People are generally friendly. However, I was subjected to not fitting in with the ""click"" since I was outsider. This team acted like little children and complained about everything you did that they didnt like and, what's worse, the VP of the department let it go on and even encouraged it. Horrible working condition!! Adopted new ""open environment"" working stations -- no privacy; everyone can hear everything. Of course the VP has has office; what? Company needs to settle and get things in place and have upper management that has a vision instead of doing it the same. Maybe then they will start to make money. Bonuses were only given to a ""select"" few which is inappropriate. Why should some get it? Moral of this story: Don't work for start-ups which is what this company is right now."
good,"Budget seems to be an issue, I've been asked to cut my hours back to 32 from 40 per week.  When asked about tuition reimbursement for my BS, I was told no tuition reimbursement for undergrad."
good,They are great if your just starting out and need to fill your resume. Working at this company does provide flex hour scheduling to a degree.
good,"Work is on a holdover sub-contract here for decades. Same people in the new company from previous contracts. No new ideas, resistant to change. The contract holder just celebrated their 50th year on this contract, Few things have changed since the early days...not even technology. We have so many hand-me-downs at work. Desks that are stamped manufacturing date of 1963, chairs that come out of surplus instead of purchasing new, funds that seem to always be depleted enough so that many employees share a community telephone number in many cases. Corporate leadership has visited once in the past five months. Our director is the senior corporate representative on site, but this same director has been here for the previous two subcontracts of different corporate ownership. Turnover rate in five years has surpassed 75%. That speaks volumes. Sorry I have nothing good to say."
good,To few people being asked to champion to many projects.  It didn't seem to me that the leaders were able to take decisions in a timely manner.  Travel demands far exceeded my desire.
good,"My experience was spending too much time working over time and weekends. There was no reward for the hard work. Some groups are not as bad as others, but my experience was not a good one due to the long hours required."
good,"Was publicly announce to the office and myself that I would be promoted to team lead; within two days the proposal was denied due to age and lack of experience by the contracting office (after being approved internally). Now, leadership wants me to train the new individual they have hired. Always undermanned. No direction. Had to constantly train new bosses and received low pay."
good,"The agency was in a poorly run series of mishaps as they sought to ""bring"" several outlying offices under one roof.  The company was in a panic mode to meet agency requirements. The requirements changed with a change of government leadership."
good,"The work being done here will make a difference."
good,"The enjoyable part is working with the customers."
good,No real room for advancement. Any promotion there did not come with a pay raise. Starting pay was nice though. Some of the team leads there could use some work on interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Other than that it is a solid job.
good,Leidos is all about making sure their clients are pleased to the fullest.  If that means treating the employers bad; then that is what the company will do.
good,"- The hardest part of the job was working with management."
good,Keep your nose down and grind for what you can as nothing will come easy here.  Excellent company and great experience to put on your resume.  The pay could be more though.
good,"Depend on what group you are in.  My group, Project manager is the boss.  His words are rules.  If you are not part of his circle, then it doesn't matter what you have done, you will be forced out, weather volunteer or he will give you an unfair report to get rid of.  There are no HR review or company guidelines.  Bottom line, nepotism rule the day."
good,"I've been in 2 different divisions at this company, 1 was really well run, people cared about each other and it felt like a family. The other, management arbitrarily threatens to fire people, they made us work ""temporary"" (4 months long) shifts, including nights and weekends, up to 70 hrs per week, with no overtime or night/weekend differential pay. "
good,Does not seem to support their employees. More focused on customers happiness which can be both good and bad. They are not consistent with information sharing when it comes to their employees and keeping them updated.
good,As long as you had a contract you were working on you were safe with your employment...as soon as contract ended you were benched and then unemployed.
good,"As the workforce was bought in the sale, it was stressful to know it was very likely we would be laid off once our systems were retired and the work was transferred to the Leidos systems."
good,"Nothing special here.  At client site with lack of program manager oversight and awareness.  Not impressed.  No team gatherings or team building of any sort.  A cog in the wheel.  Lots of window dressing (corporate communications) but at the worker bee, l am not impressed.  No team or collaborative sessions with co-workers other than what we generate.  This is why contracting is less than fulfilling.  Ready for a transition where I am recognized and rewarded."
good,"The program is filled with great people in order to support Afghanistan's fledgling air force. It tries its best to support the US government guidelines to Train, Assist, and Advise the local Afghan units, with little to show for it. Stronger support of the employees is required, but it is not terrible either. The idea is a noble one, but there are people that have been serving as contractors too long and do not like new/fresh ideas. That has lead to a stale and confusing program."
good,"Lack of Managerial involvement, on major decisions. No communications or active feedback on performance and no recommendations on areas that need to be improved"
good,Many positions had un experienced employees. Staff worked hard but Little support from above.
good,"You'll have very little support from corporate when you're in the field, and will have to 'figure it out'.  It's more like a staffing agency, that is suppose to search for more opportunities for you once your existing project/engagement is over, but they're not very good at that either.  You should always be on the look out for the next opportunity because once your current project is over, you don't have a job."
good,Always just looking for the total numbers. Didn’t care how you got to them. Everyone was just out for themselves. Confrontational interaction with a peer located in another state to the point that Ethics Dept had to intervene. Basically calling me stupid and making statements that I couldn’t follow directions.
good,"People overall are good and will be helpful. A lot of processes to follow to keep up with government requirements.  The benefits are what you expect, but nothing out of the ordinary for contract work."
good,"Upper management does not seem to understand the need for Business Continuity planning. There is a lot of talk, but little gets done. There is too much change in management."
good,My time at Leidos came about because they acquired  Lockheed Martin's Services division which included the support staff.  My typical work day consisted of performing daily analysis of demographic data and notifying payroll and finance team of any data discrepancies.  I monitored the timecard technical support mailbox and Service Now incident tickets. I assisted in resolving support and ticket issues along with assigning tickets to the proper queue and individual for resolution.
good,"In my limited experience, not a bad company to work for.  The corporate side seems well organized and HR has been friendly and helpful with the few issues I have had.  Several coworkers have also had the same comments."
good,"As Leidos and IS&GS combined, it was exciting to see how the complimentary businesses formed a new IT services power house. This helped solidify their position as the #1 IT contractor to the federal government."
good,"A typical day at work consist of driving to Daytona, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Fernandina, and Panama City."
good,"Great people solving difficult problems in a wide range of markets but the backbone of the company is federal government contracting and it has been challenging, culturally and operationally,  to diversify into commercial markets."
good,Currently a transitioning company with the IS&GS business from Lockheed Martin. Much of the staff coming from the Lockheed Martin side are overloaded with work. Upper management seems to be like strong leaders with good intentions but major changes are needed to help with the stress from the overwhelming amount of work.
good,This company is not very good at training their employees.  The atmosphere is different than a design/fabrication one.
good,"Poor communication from management and little concern for the employee as long as the company does well."
good,Good place for a career development but not for internal promotions. Company work culture is client-based; care all about meeting customer SLA and not that well with staff.
good,I depended on being at Leidos for at least 6-10 years until retirement but they depended on government contracts for the majority of their work and since they didn't win any after being there a little over a year i am out of a job. Co-workers were ok but management has its problems (I had 4 within a year). Hardest part of the job was trying to find out who my manager was and to get guidance from.
good,"Leidos is a splinter company from SAIC that has had difficulty in maintaining the culture.  Many segments of the company work in ""virtual office"" situations."
good,"I loved this company at first,but the hours you work are great.But the pay sucks  because they don't pay what you work."
good,"Leidos' split from SAIC has caused significant employee uncertainty with additional layoffs and divestitures promised. Employee benefits have recently been reduced. Employees don't dislike the company, but difficulties and delays caused by the company split and division consolidations and reorganizations have caused a lot of worry and uncertainty."
good,"I worked in two different capacities for Leidos.  I will describe both here."
good,"A standard corporate culture with standard benefits and pay. Management can be uncommunicative at times, especially to 2d/3d shift employees. Took over 2 years to get me from a contractor to a standard employee."
good,"Leidos is exceptional at business execution, winning work, etc. However, they work people too hard. There are too few personnel and too much work to go around. "
good,"Potentially a good place to work, or a bad place, depending entirely on which office and location you might be working, and/or your manager.  Our office was highly removed from the corporate culture (people wore jeans), but stuck with highly bureaucratic IT solutions infrastructure, and poorly managed and dated offices (make sure to visit the office you will actually be located...  you might need a dust mask if you are at an off-site location, or better off if with a client).  "
good,Great place to start your career. Not much opportunity for growth. Management is stale and rarely interactive with employees. Stuck at a desk 8 hours a day.
good,"Good work to get on your feet, its up to every individual to put in the work needed to advance."
good,Typical day was designing customer requirements for new electric and gas services; what I learned was that this position wasn’t secure due to only securing a one year contract with Xcel Energy; I had a good manager and he was always open to our ideas; culture was professional; hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers; most enjoyable part of the job was working in an industry I have a passion for
good,"As an overall review, most of the people are very friendly and helpful.  Due to the fact that we are in an aggressive schedule to meet the project deadline, there are often time we lost the guidance direction from 1 day to the next."
good,There is too much drama and power tripping and not enough teaching and training. They want you to do more work than the time allotted. I taught myself a lot of good skills though and I love the job itself. Good pay too!
good,"If they don't have a contract obligation to fill then there is no opportunity,  if one chooses to stay with the company there may be big gaps between employment / paychecks"
good,Leidos is a fast past environment that requires constant communication with both your internal and external customers. There are  daily meetings  that may often require you to work overtime.
good,"overall, definitely not the worst job. came in at 8am, and would typically work on various components until the end of the day. very low level stuff, especially as a tech 1. the culture of the workplace is pretty toxic however. there is one racist coworker who for some reason that eludes me still works there. 30 minute lunches tho. you pay for your benefits out of pocket however, at a what i would assume decent rates."
good,"Worked with Leidos for a little over one year. The actual job environment was good but the management is very poor. Managers refuse to address any type of issue, instead they just ignore it. In addition, they refuse to advance anyone; at least at my job location."
good,"A typical day at work began with personal vengeful management.  I learned what its like to be ousted out, to be made the black sheep and constant rumors being spread about you and learning of the rooms through gaslighting via e-mails and or while you go to the bathroom."
good,"The job  is rewarding. Management is bad. Seven day work week , no overtime. There is no holiday time off, business needs temporary contract position."
good,"I have been with this company for a little over half a decade. I have gained experience in multiple different areas and have definitely grown in a lot of positive ways. Most of the people I have worked with have been very helpful and I keep in touch with them even though I have moved through different departments through the years. I enjoy what I do but it is hard to enjoy working when there is little work to no work to be done. In the areas I have worked recently, that is becoming more frequent. It can be difficult to obtain work and if one is not staying busy, that person risks being let go. There may be many places in the company where plenty needs to be done but where this reviewer's abilities lie that has not been the case and entering into those other areas are not possible with my skill set, vast that it is."
good,"As a company Leidos is a great company to work for. However, the management could use some review by the company. I like the hours and the location. I would recommend the company to anyone looking to work for them."
good,"I'm a FT remote internal employee with Leidos Health and have been here several years.  I've had the opportunity to see all of the changes that the company has gone through over the last 4+ years, and constantly dream of the days of yesteryear.  "
good,"Leidos is a large provider of services to the US Government and also a provider of commercial engineering services, but on a much smaller scale.  The cumbersome nature of the federal side of the business chokes the commercial practice making it ineffective and frustrating."
good,As in most large corporations some divisions do better than others. A diverse and well educated employee pool provides a substantial learning environment.
good,"Average company to work for. Average management. Limited career potential or upward mobility. Long days, 60-70 hour weeks with only modest pay. Stressful work environment, and high expectations with limited resources. Unrealistic goals, and weak managers."
good,Due to the lack of job security (contract-to-contract) and working in the Government environment most Leidos employees are not truly committed to producing a quality product. A trait that truly goes against my grain.
good,"We work a standard 40 hour week, minus any holiday or corporate meetings that are mandatory. We utilize various software to accomplish our daily tasking, most noteably ArcGIS and ArcCatalog."
good,"Very friendly environment with varied working conditions.  The management style was a hand off approach, if you do you job well management is pleased."
good,"High Quality Engineering Firm."
good,"Stable, established company but very little opportunity for movement within the company, even laterally.  And little to no growth potential, you can stay at the same job for 20 years"
good,I have no complaints about the company other than I needed to seek elsewhere for advancement.  Honest opinion is that if you do not have the right connections you will not grow - but that could be said about any company.
good,"Many times called off shift and weekends by management., Given tasks with no training. Held responsible for accuracy yet asked to make judgement calls with no baseline input. Expected to do more and more work. Asked to rapidly correct huge errors created outside of my control. "
good,Went to work for Leidos doing the exact same job functions I was doing for Logistics Integration Agency as a SAIC (SAIC is now Leidos) sub-contractor.
good,"My work at this company was very productive.  Sub-contracted to work on a specific project for the Defense Department. The  project was to consolidate various databases into one single repository,"
good,"My summary probably isn't anything new to many."
good,"Very fast paced environment, which I liked.  Company in itself is a great company.  However, poor management and unfairness across the board in the company."
good,this was an interim job after the division was sold over and over again. My manager was weak and had no spine. the work was great but the leadership was lacking
good,"The company is very large now, and much of the focus has gone to government contracts. If you are not in that area, there are not as many projects. Some of the areas where there was previously a lot of projects sold are not focused on anymore. The opportunity for cross training is very minimal. Compensation and benefits are very good."
good,Leidos has average benefits but has been very poor in communicating information regarding Contract renewel.  Lowest Starting pay in the TSCM Community.
good,The work here is easy and people are nice. The only problem is that the pay is not that good since this is a government contractor. But it seems that job security is pretty good compared to other place.
good,"Leidos provides a great training portal,  a good work culture and is involved in various industries.  If you are in IT certifications are important.  Continuous learning is important at Leidos.  A typical work day can be from 8 to 10 hours depending on the workload.  There can be 12 hour days particularly if you are involved with contracts.  The hardest part of the job is making sure you are on the next contract.  Management is typically hands off.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the recognition you receive from a job well done."
good,"Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either. Leadership is out of touch, but compensation is competitive and the benefits package rivals other companies. Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"Overall a good place, management sucks. My current program spends more time on the road than in the office though which can be beneficial if you dont mind always being gone!"
good,"Since the split with SAIC, this company has gone downhill alot. The benefits are poor and the stress of being a ""shared service center"" is hard to keep a positive attitude. My co-workers are really nice but everyone is feeling the pressure and job security is not good."
good,Construction of ground water treatment systems operation and maintenance of treatment systems. Sampling of site monitoring wells for compliance.
good,"Used to be fun place to work. Things changed significantly, not many activities to make workplace fun. Management could do a better job in pursuing new opportunities and taking care of employees s'  career"
good,"General custodial duties, interacting with scientists, and office workers."
good,"Although a great opportunity to work on behalf of the government through a contract, the particular team I worked on lost 2 developers. I finished my project but the business was always pushing more work and I ended up at 60 hours a week (40 paid) for 2 months after the government shutdown in 2018/December"
good,"No sense of belonging to the company - just a big machine with most decisions made a million miles away. If you have a good team & project, life is good. It was a very good learning experience. One positive: they regularly repeated the need for integrity."
good,check systems every hour for discrepancy program new and old clients into the system. Up-keep passwords. Save database information local and remote. Assist in upkeep of 150 computers.
good,"Talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.  Afraid to tell their customers the truth, instead focused on squeezing as much money out of every opportunity as possible, regardless of whether it is the right thing to do for the customer."
good,When we were acquired by Lockheed Martin I thought everything was going to be great. The teams were all super smart and I learned so much. Once we got all settled in it was a pretty nice place.
good,"Okay place to work at. Direct supervisor is usually in another state and only contacts you you haven't inputted you time in timecard daily. Other than that, good benefits."
good,"OK Work Life balance"
good,I enjoy the business unit I worked in in Hawaii. Great people there. Working in the Pacific Network Operations Center was wonderful. Different from the other NOCs.
good,Leidos has a good working environment and it also depends on the program and area you work in. There is good opportunities within the company. The company has good support team as well.
good,"As I worked diligently at Leidos, the employees of the prime contract, ABSC were privileged with less responsibilities.  I felt as if I was not given the assistance I asked for."
good,"They will not go out of their way to accommodate your situation despite the size of the company.  You make one mistake and they will throw you under the bus.  No support system, there are many layers of management and leadership you might as well give up and don't ask for anything no matter how bad you need something."
good,"Staffed up approximately 20 people and then laid them all off with two weeks notice."
good,"• Responsible for proposal preparation, contract negotiation, and "
good,Leidos has many leading technologists doing very interesting and rewarding work. The corporate culture is numbers driven which leads to staff required to be working on contracts virtually all the time or risk being laid off.
good,Our division of Lockheed Martin was bought out by Leidos. We transitioned our payroll onto their systems over the course of a year and a half. We knew that we would be laid off as a result of this and there were no jobs to continue with under Leidos.
good,"Split from SAIC a few years ago, but nearly identical in every aspect. Defense contracts, constant churn to stay covered, basic benefits, predictable work environment."
good,"great place to begin a career, friendly people not enough bonuses or incentives.  Typically worked on our own, minimum supervision....................."
good,"almost all my projects at leidos are government contracts. leidos needs to conform to the customer's rules and regulations. also,about 90% of my work at leidos was at the customer's site."
good,"The typical day as in Lockheed Martin. But the efficiency of help desk"
good,"Alright, The management isnt that great. The core of the contract is held together by a small group of analysts who really care about the program and want to see it be successful"
good,"If you want to get ahead, you need to take the initiative to learn and grow.  Management will not hold hands -- they seem overwhelmed with the amount of Corporate reviews, approvals and staff oversight.  Corporation went through several changes in the last 10 years so one must be flexible with reorgnizations, new polices and tools."
good,My experience at Leidos was challenging. Contract loss was the reason for leaving.  Leidos have great benefits and the necessary tools to help encourage growth.
good,Things are always changing and the work environment is very unstable.  Once a year it seems like management pulls the rug out on employees with drastic changes.
good,"Management ignored the total value of experienced and highly rated employees in order to meet layoff goals. For example my performance was rating was high and considered one of the most experienced in my field. Built the #1 rated Procurement team for metrics such as cost savings, audit compliance, cash flow and building relationships with management."
good,"Work is valuable and important to the customer. The program is growing quickly and more workspace is needed, However, overall a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. All equipment and software necessary is provided and makes it easy to complete assignments."
good,"Everyone I’ve met here is courteous and professional with one exception - a recent new hire. Not impressed with her work, she’s brash, inconsiderate, insincere, loquacious, and yet even after weeks with the company, still mispronounced the name – unfortunate."
good,"Leidos is your standard government contractor. "
good,"I enjoyed the work itself.  Program Mgmt oversight was lacking for certain key issues.  Primary interest was success, success, success, without concern for negative issues.  This allowed for negative issues to grow and hold only the person reporting to be held to any account.  Loyalty is a necessary tool, but, willfull deglect of workplace issues is not conducive for continued success.  Willful biase and neglect of PM caused hostile working environment that could have been easily worked out, but laziness with focus only on success can only be tolerated for so long, no matter how great job itself was."
good,"Leidos is pretty much your typical run of the mill contracting firm. Employee treatment is fair and the benefits are decent, but your success at the company is completely dependent on the project you work on and if your project should end you might be out of a job."
good,Flexible workplace with less vacation. Liked working there and management was good. But the projects are unpredictable and not a lot of job security. Overall fine.
good,Too early to tell how the new Leidos will be.  Still too many changes since Lockheed Martin IS&GS merger to know what the new culture and benefits will look like.
good,"Leidos is a nice place to work.; however, you ca not grow unless you move to Maryland VA.  The managment teams work together to unsure you get to proper training."
good,Great place to work. Never a dull moment. You will learn something new everyday. Meet new people everyday and work with great people.  The job has its challenges which makes it even more exciting.
good,"Overall it has been a great place to work. The hardest part is gaps in the work flow, when you're busy an amazing place to work. Projects vary greatly and you have to wear many hats."
good,Not bad. The company needs to audit the contract companies they use. Upper management is solid. Middle management is solid. Web based training needs improvement.
good,Direct management very supportive; senior leadership out of touch with most of company. Ridiculous reporting requirements.
good,Not enough time after merger to review before contract end. There was no change in job or management after The RMT merger of Lockheed Martin and Leidos.
good,"I was working for Lockheed Martin when LM and Leidos did a deal where Leidos took over the contract. Then the DoD cut our budget and I got laid off. So I feel I didn't have enough time to accurately evaluate Leidos. However, my time transferred from LM and Leidos provided a severance package."
good,Leidos is a young very diverse company that has difficulty figuring out how to organize itself. Needs more mature SR management and  leadership.
good,Great Co-Workers and Great Students.  I enjoyed teaching students from all over the USA. The facility was an old military hospital.  Great teaching point.
good,"I would recommend to other people! They are very willing to work with you on anything, people are very nice and laid back."
good,"You'll spend your life working there.  No time off, no vacations. You'll work during your evenings, weekends and holidays.  But the co-workers are great."
good,Very nice environment. You work on your own pace.  Co-workers are nice and friendly.   I have learned alot through my co-workers.
good,They offer good benefits and have a competitive range of salaries. But there is not much in the way of career growth.The environment is very relaxed.
good,"As with any company, your experience at Leidos Biomedical will only be as good as your manager. They are currently shuffling things around in hopes to win a rebid of the FNLCR operations contract."
good,"Leidos has a nice flexible feel to it and there are different nuances that any person can enjoy.  "
good,"This is a company of brilliant engineers, scientists and analysts.  They have solved many of our country's most difficult challenges."
good,"Great place to work, however they are in a transition phase."
good,There have been numerous transitions at this company in the last couple of years.
good,Learned a great deal since I have been on this team; took some training in both the Infrastructure and Applications dept.  I really loved working with my team members.
good,Worked with great people on Contract.   Poor job advancement. Benefits lacking.
good,"Flexible work hours"
good,Good work/life balance and really meaningful work. Flexible hours allow you to focus on other pursuits-a very valuable commodity in today's work place.
good,"Managers are pretty open to exploring exciting research, and will support trying new things. Opportunities to reach out for collaboration are also encouraged. The culture varies from group to group, but I have been fortunate to develop friendships that will go beyond this position."
good,"It doesn’t suck, but job security is questionable. Recently, I had to find out what their talent scouts could do for me, so this review could be worse."
good,"I was only there for 8 months, but the work environment was good, the people with whom I worked were great .  The managers cared, but knew the story.  The customer was great."
good,"Only needed to go to NY for training, then able to work remotely from home. Hours were during normal business hours. Always online for questions and help if needed."
good,Depending on the project you work you have flexible hours but they are going backward in terms of helping the workforce to work remotely. It is a big NO unless there is Snow storm.
good,Enjoyed working there at first.  My first manager was great!  Current management sucks and higher management is worse.  Hardest part of job is working with holier than thou co-workers
good,"Leidos is your average government contractor located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. They are nothing special but there are some outstanding co-workers there."
good,Has a great atmosphere and better managers than larger defense contractors. The team at Leidos are much more humble and easer to work with. The teams are less aggressive than most company's. However the pace is slower. I prefer a faster pace but I am sure they has spots of that but I am not sure where
good,Awesome company to work for. Management is attentive and relaxed. Independent work environment. The most enjoyably part of the job is collaborating with coworkers to solve problems.
good,"This is a highly technical company that delivers high quality products on power delivery, military and health services. The employees are highly motivated and work well as a team. They are very friendly and accomodating. The company expects work from the employees but there is no real motivation. No bonusses are paid, no medical benefit for international employees. Time taken off for company functions is personal time. Personal vacation time is limited to 16 days including sick time. Management is quite young and a bit lacking experience in some areas."
good,"I met some good people doing work with Leidos. Some elements of middle management could have been much better. Earning and taking vacation was easy, just required some advance notice. I did enjoy most of my coworkers most of all. Typical days of work were simple; work your 8, have a good lunch then go home. I continue to learn not everyone has your best interests at heart."
good,"Leidos as a company is a good place to start.  The salaries are on par maybe a little low compared to the rest of the industry.  My immediate supervisor keeps me in the loop with anything going on.  The medical benefits are awful, almost not worth having.  High deductible choice or high premium.  Industry standard leave and holidays.   Project managers don't come around to see how you are doing ever."
good,Leidos has recently merged with a portion of Lockheed Martin that spun off. The merger has been messy. Leidos is an expert in talent acquisition in government contracts in the Civilian Government space.
good,Leidos have great talented professionals that are willing to get the task done.  The hours are flexible and normal.  They do not allow working from home unless conditions are approved by management.
good,Good company with good benefits. I was not with them long enough to develop a good working relationship. I would work for them again to develop a better working relationship. I would also recommend this company to anyone else.
good,Average DOD Contractor with Employement Benefits for Full time employees.  Average work week consists of 40 hours with opportunity for extended work week hours.
good,the company is great to work for. I think the best part about the company is their flexibility and able to work with you as an individual if your having any problems
good,"I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office."
good,"Leidos is a nice place to work, the people are professional and the atmosphere is good, but it is tough to progress in your career. Leidos does a bad job of promoting from within and normally chooses to hire people outside the company to fill roles in new contracts. The company does not have a good career progression track or a good mentoring program. The pay and benefits are pretty good, but don't expect too much upward mobility."
good,It was a great beginning for my endeavor into the consulting world.  The one drawback was bench time. That could get frustrating waiting for another assignment.
good,"The company could strive to be much better. But is currently only striving to meet earning projections."
good,"A typical work day at Leidos includes sampling clean rooms, data entry/review and performing various lab assays. "
good,"New company changing environment"
good,"I worked for SAIC, now Leidos, for 8 years. After the company went public, benefits and other perks began to disappear, specifically the health insurance benefits. Although the salary offered is decent and in line with other consulting firms of their size, I found that upward mobility within the company was difficult."
good,"Good place to work. Typical Classified work environment, work 4 hrs a week pretty much make my own hours. Work extra during crisis situations."
good,Great benefits: PTO and vacation. Healthcare is just okay. Very good work-life balance. Some cool team volunteer opportunities like  the Marine Corp Marathon bids.
good,"Mostly contract wok, when contract ends people tend to get stressed.  The company tends to operate like hundreds of small companies under one umbrella."
good,Working at Leidos was a great experience. They have a work hard now and play right after attitude. Managers were encouraging and challenged your learning.
good,"Leidos is a good company. Its business is mostly in IT and engineering services. Also,its a government contractor and they are leaving Tampa, specifically my job is being sent to Tuscan."
good,"I can mainly address my business unit and related ones with which I interfaced.  When I started it was a very friendly business unit.  Modest turnover, good supervision, and friendly coworkers.  Comfortable and people friendly. Then a related business unit was sold, many surgical lay offs, and more significant voluntary departures.  Became much less people friendly and more billable hours focused after merger with former Lockheed Martin IS GS business unit."
good,"Since becoming Leidos in 2013, company has been in constant flux.  Jobs continue to be eliminated and people/jobs moved back and forth across the country."
good,"In my experience if you can show your worth and be recognized by management, those managers will go above and beyond for you. However not everyone can get noticed in such a large company so you really have to work hard to get that visibility."
good,"Leidos was two thirds of SAIC that was spun off to be a separate corporation. I was hired a few days after the split and it has been chaotic. "
good,"Leidos mostly does US defense tech and medical tech contracting. As a software dev intern, I worked on minor internal projects with other interns and mentors. The environment is your fairly standard office setup with cubicles and issued bulky Windows 7 laptops. One of the teams I worked with adopted a form of Agile, and the other just did weekly meetings and more free-form planning. Management is your standard hierarchical tree-structure, and in my experience superiors were very receptive to concerns and available for chats. Leidos' most lucrative contracts require personnel to have security clearance, so you will most likely be urged to acquire one, which involves background checks, interviews, polygraphs, etc."
good,"Like all government contractors, you get to work on specific missions that really have an impact. The work is interesting, challenging, and enjoyable. The experience will obviously vary by the contract you work on. The downside however is the volatility of employment, when budget cuts hit, there goes your position."
good,"They try to keep you in the company. If a contract ends, they work on getting you a job on another contract within the company which lessens the stress of the employee in having to search for a job outside the company."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Leidos. There is great work and life balance here. That reason has kept me here and happy over the last 5 years. Fun culture friendly peers.
good,"The Leidos, Inc. Denver, CO office had a great work culture, and great room from career development. Everyone in the office has many years of experience and are more than willing to share this wisdom with fellow coworkers. There is also much room for lateral growth, with opportunities to work with new technologies and markets."
good,"Work is good. You are deployed a lot in my current job. However, corporate culture in a typical job is nice. The company pays for education and there are advancements if you're willing to move."
good,"A typical day of work includes tracking/monitoring hardware assets from inbound shipments from vendors to de-installation/life cycle replacement."
good,"Leidos has a great management team, surrounded by even better co-workers.  Great place to enhance your knowledge of healthcare governance and policy."
good,If you're looking for a place to be where you don't have to do much and get paid then Leidos is the place for you. Did a lot of sitting around in my time there.
good,The regional lead is any amazing person who truly values her employees.  There are many benefits including discounts on various items and tuition reimbursement. The only thing is it seem HR protects some people that are a problem and bringing down the morale of the entire region.
good,"Typical work day is quick-paced constantly working with customers to resolve their network problems"
good,"I liked working here.  the people are great, the setting is lovely and it's in Central Florida.  The weather is great- rains every day - but everything is green.  I would recommend LRH to anyone who is interested in working here."
good,"Working for Leidos has been a great learning experience as I have supported several training courses including hazmat, radiological, and law enforcement courses. Negative aspects include substandard healthcare and also lacks sufficient compensation for everything the job entails."
good,They were not the best at sales after a project was completed. Due to this the career with Leidos ended sooner that expected. The sales team needs to be better prepared.
good,great opportunity to see various types of materials received. Need to have SOP broken down to simplify processes. No physical certificates given for Forklift operators.
good,"Company works to create a diverse work force. Good balance with work life and home life. Flexible hours to accommodate this."
good,"Leidos as a company was great to work for. My only complaint is the work environment I was placed in. My colleagues were very disrespectful, condescending, and demoralizing."
good,Job security is not good.  Employees get pay when there is a contract otherwise the employees have to leave with out pay or get lay-off.  Health benefits is not good either.
good,"Company's main customer is the US Government multiple organizations, so work life balance is mainly controlled by the contract agreement. Overall the company is contract heavy with a set timeline, 2-5 years and job security is based on contract awarding."
good,"Good company with lots of opportunity. Beware of bad management and managers who are not qualified to manage people and or departments. If you can find a good manager or mentor, it's a good place to work."
good,Good for one or two year contracts. Almost no job security in the DOD contract world. You never know whats going on. Just keep your head down and do your job.
good,"The culture at Leidos is transparent and fast paced.  SInce the recent acquisition of Lockheed Martin Corporation - IS&GS there is still quite a bit of uncertainty and ""stress"" as the two corporations try to find common ground.  Leidos is transparent and liberal and light on processes (which is both positive and difficult depending on what one is trying to accomplish).  Whereas LMC is very conservative and process oriented (which is both positive and difficult depending on what one is trying to accomplish).  The hardest part of the job was managing the differences in Management styles and philosophies between the two organizations and trying to ""get things done"".  I enjoyed every aspect of my job, most notably working with my Customers and Client Groups (internal and external), resolving complex Global issues and making a difference."
good,"You're a valued member of the team...until you're not. As long as there is a contract you can bill, you'll be a welcome addition. When there's nothing for you, there's the door."
good,A average day would consist of making sure that would had work to do an you stay billable no matter what. I would get to work get the to do list for the day and try an complete by the end of the day. you where tasked with impossible dead lines you had to meet. work until the job was 100% done then you would move onto the next job. I learned how to manage time and work with a team of people to have a project completed in a very timely manner along with everyone staying busy so that there was not one person doing the same job. Just like any job there are always managers and co-workers that you never could see eye to eye with but other then that it was a average work environment. the hardest part of the job was making sure that a clear line of communication was established and everyone working on the project was on the same page. most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a project completed and knowing the client got what they wanted or more and where satisfied with the product they received.
good,There are lots of potential to move elsewhere within the company.  Benefits provided through work are very generous and easy to take advantage of. Has overall decent job outlook.
good,BOA San Antonio Texas and Ive been with the company 5 years and I wish they had other opportunities in other places that you could just transfer to.
good,Not much growth opportunities here. I did enjoy working with my coworkers and it was very laid-back. There was little job security which was very stressful when waiting on getting new contracts. Healthcare benefits were pretty awful.
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,"To me it is terrible, you never get to take paid vacation without having to work or to be called way too much by your manager while you are away. I have had to cancel many vacation days as a result and once you reach 400 hours you accrue no more so in essence you are giving away your earned vacation time. A horrible environment"
good,"This is a good company. They are relatively new still, but have a lot to  offer. Unfortunately, I was furloughed after working for them for a year and did not get to see the company work out some of the issues it was facing soon after the split from SAIC."
good,Leadership only cares about the current contract and not where employees will be in 5 or 10 years.  They say they want to build a team and teach new skills when they hire you but it never happens.
good,they really reached out to their employees and made sure they were doing well. positive work enviroment and great coworkers. Good management. Good compinsation
good,Wonderful experience in a relaxed environment. opportunity to grow and develop your personality. Chances of core facility colaboration is high. Salary is ok.
good,"Good company to work for. Management was good. Benefits were good. Horrible at employee resources and reassignment if your contract is lost. Pay was decent, but if you don't negotiate your salary they will underpay you."
good,Good general work environment with a lot of work.  The hardest part of the job is spending time with family because you are on call very often.  The most enjoyable part would be team comradery.
good,"Good company to work for, with a very smart and talented work force.  Company contract talent effectively works in a broad range of industries with a broad range customer-base."
good,Define Strategy and Implementation for Business Enterprise Architecture
good,A newly formed company with growth opportunities.  An encouraging management team who praises leadership skills and participation in monthly staff meetings.  Focused on the needs of the clients to ensure sustainability in the marketplace.
good,This job looks for insider threats and is a fast pace learning environment. My co workers have a security background and put forth a lot of knowledge to the program. The hardest part of the job is researching all the applications that we utilize to find the insider threats. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding the people who violate policies and writing up reports about them.
good,"	Responsible for validating data from various laboratories for state and federal projects."
good,Since merger from SAIC with Vitalize and MaxIT has been a bumpy road.  Management has been more involved with more meetings and updates.  Took some perks away. biggest downfall is the bonus structure.
good,Company outlook shaky. Medical benefits are poor. Otherwise the work was rewarding.
good,Leidos has a small company feel with approachable leadership and down to earth employees. Leadership listens and takes into account ideas and improvements.
good,Everyday can present a new challenge.  It is important to be flexible because tasks and priorities are constantly changing.
good,Good company from what I seen. Good life work balance.  Family came first at least with the manager I was under.  I is a shame the contract I was working on was a failing one.
good,Are great. Some of the management is not so great. they offer a lot of incentives for their employees also. I enjoy working for the company and hope to pursue other opportunities.
good,"Very effective relationships with widely diverse groups, including individuals at all levels both within and outside the organization and gain their cooperation."
good,"Perform a series of system checks to ensure servers, network connections and all necessary services are online.  I have learned to work fully independently in troubleshooting system issues until I have reached the end of my knowledge/ experience then understanding when/ who to reach out to further assist in resolution. Workplace culture out here has been the most enjoyable part of the job.  The analysts I have supported have been great and have provided a good sounding board to learn more about the systems I administer from a user's point of view."
good,"Didn't really meet upper management with the exception of the Program Manager"
good,"Leidos/SAIC attracts intelligent, committed employees.  The on-site teams are allowed to work with some autonomy to ensure client support and satisfaction."
good,Leidos offers many worker benefits and opportunities to collaborate with a diverse team. The office environment was calm and professional. I would recommend to others.
good,"My only complaint about them is advancement in training. I wanted to go to class to learn other applications, but was always on call during legacy support, so had no one to back me up. Now that my area of expertise is being sunsetted in a few years, I have nothing to fall back on."
good,Sold experience as shift lead during day shift on the operations floor. Stressful environment as issues need to be resolved as soon as possible. Worked closely with government officials.
good,"Leidos has been great at finding work for me when I needed it.  They don't always have work for me, however, and are known for letting people go when they can't find work.  It's great as long as they have work, but once the project is over you need to have somewhere else to work."
good,Company culture in Oak Ridge could use a change.  I do not think the rest of Leidos is like this area and if I were willing to relocate would be a great job to have.
good,Leidos is a long time DoD / Government contractor.  Typical ups and downs due to contracting environment.  Many long time employees with career instability stresses for senior employees in certain positions/area.
good,"I designed Structural steel and reinforced concrete. I lead structural designer in the civil group. I designed bridges, water treatment plants and Hydropower, Dam’s, Dam Safety."
good,I enjoy the benefits package provided by the company. I think more can be done to help the employees that do want to grow with the company. Overall I do enjoy the perks of the life/work balance.
good,"Management was professional, and courteous. However, the atmospherics were a bit bureaucratic and inflexible. The training managers were hard working, educated, and gracious."
good,"Can feel repetitive, but you can learn a lot depending on who you are working with. The ability to flex schedule is the best part of working at the job great for work life balance."
good,"Interesting and young  company"
good,Like most government consulting firms it is a bit of a body shop.  You provide whatever service the government customer needs.  The best part is when you are used as staff augmentation.  The worst part is when you get all of the administrivia and grunt jobs.  Working as a SETA for a national security customer is tremendously rewarding and important.
good,"Leidos is a pretty standard large size company. I feel the training/mentorship could use some work. I wish there was a stronger connection between middle management and the workers. I don't know if that is the case for most of the contracts that Leidos holds though."
good,"Management in the consulting practice has been fairly hands off, which I appreciate. Consultants' priorities are the clients they work for. Very little is asked beyond doing good work for the client. Corporate has been continuously tweaking compensation and HR policies, often for the worse. However, they are very receptive to feedback and willing to make changes when they know they've pushed things too far."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Leidos.  I loved the people I worked with, and got a huge amount of satisfaction out of the work we did.  The work was challenging at times, as was the environment. Still, I'd do it all again."
good,Managing priorities and time management are a must.  Best interest of the client is key in this environment with a focus on quality.
good,I enjoyed working at Leidos because we were beautifying the city after the ice storm. I felt like I was really contributing to the community.
good,Leidos has many jobs in different fields. This is a great place to obtain a clearance and work with the costumer.  Moving to other tasks can be tricky though.
good,Working in this office has been excellent.  The only issue has been the number of contracts that the office has is pretty limited.
good,Ulitilze writing skills and interact with intellegent people daily in order to provide clients with a quality product and support.
good,Seems to be a pretty decent company. I'm at a remote location so don't get much interaction with other Leidos employees.  Pretty much on my own.  No problems with Leidos management.
good,"Decent company to work for with good compensation and benefits. Depends where you work for how your supervisor will be. Mine was decent but not the greatest, again all depends on you and your location/situation."
good,"There's a big difference between corporate Leidos and work site Leidos. While corporate Leidos is very much what you'd expect in an office setting, the work sites will vary, depending on the contract Leidos is supporting."
good,"I've learned a lot while working for this company. As time went on, I received more and more tasks, and was doing them very well, until we ended up losing two team members in a short amount of time. One moved on for better opportunities, another was drafted to another team within the finance group. I ended up taking on the work of two people and finding ways to simplify processes to help reduce the amount of time it would take to get the job done. When the second person left our team, they did start to look for another person to hire, but in the meantime, I had taken on some of the responsibilities of the second person that left, as well as keeping all of my prior duties, until the new team member was hired.  Then I was put to work training her on taking over payroll, so I could focus more on clearing aged items from reconciliation.  All of this , and no extra pay was offered, no extra benefits or bonuses.  The people are very friendly, but the benefits are not good. The best health insurance they offer has a very high deductible. You have to spend $4k per person before any insurance starts covering health appointments."
good,"Challenging and rewarding engineering position. "
good,Laid back environment.  You are able to work with little or no supervision.  Pay is decent and have the opportunity to travel and receive a classified clearance.
good,"Barely spoke with my Manager as they were in another city. Which can be a good or a bad thing was I was free to make my own decisions but generally lacked feedback beyond ""Consider no news good news"""
good,Fast-paced company. Big corporate atmosphere. A lot of structure and control from management to provide continuity amongst processes. Strong leadership.
good,"I work 4 days a week 10 hour days. I was a consultant for the company. They had great benefits."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with. Management tries to help their employees be successful in the daily grind. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be working with people that don't care about their jobs or the willingness to help others.
good,Good Place to work . Great work life balance. Everyone is supportive of each other. Pay level is one of the highest in the industry. I love this job. .
good,busy busy busy!!!  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I knew that what I was doing on a daily basis was actually impacting and  making a difference in the process of the mission.
good,"I absolutely loved the work, loved the people, but the company shafted me. I came on thinking I was getting a raise (I was), but they didn't tell me how much of a raise I was getting ( a really low one compared to my peers), and I had to fight tooth and nail to get what should have been pretty standard given the line of work. But, that said, they did give me bonuses and they did stay out of my hair unless I needed them for something, so I can't complain too much,"
good,No micro mangers. Leidos is family oriented and encourages work and family balance. They don't mind rolling up their sleeves and jumping into a community project.
good,"detail oriented, reliable, cooperative, works well with others including difficult people, review processes on a yearly schedule, review products based on delivery schedule, advise project managers on correctly following software processes in order to keep projects compliant with the contract"
good,Matrix management organization with many levels of influence from top down. Due to this and the number of mini organizations inside of the company it is difficult to staff new work.
good,"The job was terrific, the company took care of its employees and only leaving because the contract ended. Good leave accrued policy and terrific and reimbursing certificates and education."
good,"Leidos itself is a huge, multinational company.  The project I was on was focused in one small office.  The people I worked with are phenomenal. Management is focused more on the bottom line than the people, though.  Understandable, but still bothersome.  Corporate management seems to understand different contracts would require different SDLC processes, but worked hard to try to get everyone following one.  Unfortunately, it was one that required far more red tape than most needed."
good,"A good company with good benefits and good ethics. A lot of the work is government contractor support. As long as the customer is happy, management is happy. Telecommuting was allowed."
good,"The pay could be more,  there should be easier options if people would like to transfer. The benefits hours etc are great, the pay is just not enough. Raises tend to be a slap in the face."
good,Many once and done people. There are no guarantees of a second project. You can get pigeon holed into a certain role which limits your chances of a future assignment.
good,"Leidos is a typical government contracting company. Once on site,  you are on your own with very little interaction with the company only if you need something. If the contract you are on turns out that its not your thing, you have stay there or quit."
good,"I like the company, very organized and professional; the leave and medical benefits could be a lot better; willing to offer fair salary; like any contract company, lacks job security."
good,"I learned quite a bit from working here at Leidos.  It was the first time I had ever integrated commercial off the shelf products to create a large, full spectrum product.  My day consisted of a SCRUM meeting every morning, and worked a full 8 hours every day.  It was a great job, but there is absolutely nothing exciting about the products they are creating."
good,This company has many upsides if you are on a high visibility project.  The benefits are pretty good and I have had a decent work/life balance.
good,"Leidos has LOTS of opportunities....come join us! "
good,"Each day brought new challenges to be worked, because of the amount of people logging in and out of the system there is always someone that will lock out their account and need a password reset. Being a people person it was great to work with everyone on a daily basis."
good,The most enjoyable part of this position was having the opportunity to meeting and work with different hospital teams and consultants.
good,Electrical Engineering firm working with some of the nations largest electricity providers. Very reputable company with a good working environment.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to have all the knowledge infront of  you so that you can gain vital cyber security information for career growth. Possibilities are endless.
good,"Just when you think you've seen or experienced it all, think again.  This is one of the most rewarding aspects of my job.  The interconnectedness of the Navy's vast supply chain necessitates an almost continuous reboot and cultivation of basic skills as the equipment used in day-to-day activities varies so greatly."
good,Lots of opportunities to move between contracts.  Usually steady work in an unsteady environment (contracting).  Competitive benefits and good salary.
good,"The schedule is on a 3-2-2-3 panama schedule, and switches from days to nights every three months. A great deal can be learned from the strategic ISR point of view. Management and co-workers are great to work with and responsive to concerns problems in the work place. The hours and the ever changing schedule make it hard to have a great family lifestyle. The greatest part of this job is knowing that you are affecting the battle field for the soldiers on the ground, and influencing and mentoring new analysts."
good,"Thankfully my working condition is good. Everyone gets along, there are no major issue between technical proficiency or personality clashes. I know not every office is like that but thankfully mine is."
good,"Leidos is primarily a contract service provider for government agencies. My experience has been good overall.  As a contractor embedded in an agency office, respect can be difficult to earn, but it is possible with the right attitude. It can be a mixed bag with the culture, but I have enjoyed my time overall and would highly recommend."
good,"Decent place to work. Very little room for advancement. Treated fairly for advancement, salary and educational advancements."
good,Professional place to work  and have great group atmosphere.  Open to new ideas and options. A mix  of young and old people the gel well together to finish projects
good,"Good place to work.  People are helpful, but beware of management who has their own agenda.  Some people are only interested in numbers and getting kick-backs."
good,Spent most of my time sub contracted under another company. The communication I had with management and IT were always great. They gave me authority to act as administrator on my laptop which was pretty great. I would work with them again.
good,"Leidos acts as a middle-man, brokering labor between the government and individuals.  Individuals are Leidos employees, not sub-contractors.  As long as the contract is being fulfilled to the the customer's satisfaction, all is good.  Once the contract is done, so are you."
good,Overall a well rounded experience with the company who is willing to teach their new employees new experiences as well as having a comfortable work environment
good,"Work level and expectations are high. It is a very challenging atmosphere.  Enjoying my time on current programs, but company is hindered by government lordship--not able to always deliver results within our capability."
good,Good perks if you take advantage of them. Work/life balance most of the time gets affected for the workload; so' much work to deal in short amount of time.
good,Really enjoyed working in the environment that supported the AF mission.  Constantly on the move and rarely sat at a desk.  Would recommend doing ISR if there is an opportunity.
good,My responsibilities included the management of a group of skilled consultants in the competition for and prosecution of consulting services work in the consumer owned electrical utility industry.  I greatly enjoyed my work relationships and a true sense of teamwork and collaboration.  It was challenging to meet corporate performance expectations in a publicly-traded company dominated primarily by federally-oriented work while being commercially-oriented.
good,"Being a contractor supported facility, it was difficult to get approval to staff our department appropriately while we were being tasked with providing a wider range of support and customer service. This stretched the already thin team, which caused burnout."
good,Traditional healthcare staff augmentation contract work that has lots of ups and downs due to shifting regulatory landscape.  Say they are trying to change but into other areas but not moving very fast.
good,"In the struggle to meet customer demands in a resource-constrained environment, creativity and collaboration are encouraged.  No two workdays are exactly the same, and the coworkers are supportive and nurturing."
good,"Leidos is a large company, and your specific experience in a specific group may vary. Leidos was carved out of SAIC, and the culture of SAIC remained (at least at the local level)."
good,Leidos is one of the best companies to work for!  They take stock in their employees providing quarterly luncheons with great orientations.  The managers seem to love their jobs.
good,It was a great environment to work with. Instructions were clear and the compensation for the particular job was very generous. Great balance between military and civilian companies.
good,Lots of tokens and security at Leidos. I found it to be a good place to learn allot of new things. Great bunch of guys and a pretty good environment to work in.
good,This particular site wasn't very good at acquiring contracts but it is a good company. IT was  a mix of all kinds of managers but i did learn a lot. I would be willing to work there again.
good,"Leidos has various contacts for outsourced IT work. The companies that outsource the work usually want to save money. They save money by given less benefits to the contractors.  Less vacation, less sick time, less 401k, no severance."
good,"They care about the employees,and emphasize a great work life balance. A typical work day is based on the different programs that one may be part of. Management is always seeking employee input on how to make things better for the customers as well as the employees."
good,"what is there to really say? it is a major company and is pretty much ran as one. You are just number, pay is pretty good though. I have had no issues with this company but I personally have never really felt connected to it."
good,Good place to learn process and procedures for commercial and federal contracts. Big company that has many career paths to pursue along with diverse skill sets
good,"Busy day mostly with customer interaction.Managed team ,good workplace culture,enjoyed working with team."
good,"Love working for Leidos; I was part of a small team that worked remotely for the contract client and always felt part of the team. Even though I worked remotely, I always felt connected."
good,"Leidos is a major government contractor for NIH/NIAID. The company has a great ethic and focuses on integrity, work productivity, and innovation. Management empowers staff to be creative, share ideas, and become leaders in their areas of expertise."
good,"I was a contractor so I was never in office."
good,"They have good benefits and seem to try to help find new contracts. "
good,"Diverse workplace (contractors, retired federal employees, interns). Great working relationship with client. Direct supervisor is very accommodating and supportive."
good,"As with most government acquisition programs, if you're on contract and performing the work, all is good. But when the contract expires, or there is a government shutdown due to politics, or you don't win the follow-on, then you have to deal with the downside of that."
good,"perfect place to work but they move operation to clear water , the manager was a good guy and the team work too  , close to my home and good pay too ..."
good,"Being legacy SAIC, Leidos comes with many of the same cultural practices as SAIC. However, it's many changes over the last few years have left some feeling unstable or over stepped by reorganization.  Change is good but it doesn't make everyone happy while others have benefited in their careers due to the change."
good,"People are amazing, management is learning how to leverage their team."
good,"Steady workflow with familiar programs and customers."
good,"I joined Leidos/SAIC when it was privately owned.  Honestly, those were the ""good old days."" Between the contracting environment (very cut-throat) and being publicly traded, there were some management things I didn't like, but that doesn't change the fact that I worked with wonderful people and enjoyed doing my job."
good,"Working overseas has its pros and cons. Leidos does many things well in recruiting and incentivizing talent for such positions. The salary and other incentives are very attractive. One thing Leidos could do better is keep tabs on Program and Project Managers and how they are managing their programs and projects and employees. Overall, however, the experience of working abroad in combination with the attractive benefits package makes working for Leidos a good experience."
good,Ability to work with multiple individuals and groups to identify and develop strategies to capture new opportunities and qualified candidates to support current and future programs.
good,Work off-site but management keeps information flowing. I enjoy making daily tasks for non-IT individuals user-friendly. Being off-site provides me with limited face-to-face communication with my Leidos peers.The hardest part of my job is my long commute.
good,"Leidos Health strives to be the top provider of skilled Healthcare IT resources and it has been my privilege to work for them.  Overall, the firm is generally open to improvement and takes very good care of employees. They have transitioned and adapted well as the space of HIT has changed through the years and although I left for a few years, I would be interested in working for this firm until retirement if they are able to keep me busy."
good,I appreciate the fact that Leidos has a steadfast commitment to integrity and ethical behavior and it shows in our approach to our work every day.
good,"I learned to work with many levels of management. I also managed to have a great work/life balance with great managers. My co-workers are great. Best part of my job is I never know what the day holds, I could be working a project, audit, or proposal one day and the next I could be supporting a huge conference."
good,At times fast past of production activities and periods of re-tooling as preperations for future demands.
good,Involved in documentatation and process mapping. Exposure to finance and accounting
good,My job is dependent upon the customer for whom I work.  My company is reestablishing its newly branded name across the industry and will grow accordingly with many new and exciting opportunities.
good,Leidos is a good company to work for and management always try to work with their employees to ensure that they have the necessary tools and information to do their jobs.
good,"This job is excellent for new grads.  It is a very friendly, informal culture, and there are a lot of learning opportunities with up-to-date tech stacks.  Unfortunately, it seems that employees only seem to last 2 or 3 years here.  There isn't much opportunity to move up past Junior, and the raises aren't very impressive.  Overall I would still recommend Leidos to new grads."
good,"I enjoy working for Leidos however I do not work at HQ. Leidos however, is only a phone call away if ever I need them.  I have access to my management here on site and I am able to login the companies website to input or receive all information i may need."
good,Worked for many contractors in the area and having been through another company sector sale with another company I will say SAIC handled the transition to Leidos seamlessly.
good,Great place to work and great management. Benefits for health insurance could be better. Upper level management tries to keep employees informed of changes.
good,Worked alone in a cubicle all summer. Was given a project to complete by myself which was hard to get started on because I did not receive enough training on the system.
good,I may have lucked out. I worked on a contract for Leidos for the government. My team worked really well with one another and managment had a friendly repoir with their peers and employees. They allowed a flexible work schedule and they were always informative about the company's position in the world and the differences we were making.
good,"A fast paced work environment. Team oriented. Provides Executive Support to senior level Directors/Deputies, including managing the calendar, ensured appropriate briefing materials were provided, and coordinated logistics to make sure that they were able to conduct their responsibilities promptly and efficiently."
good,Have the tools needed for job and management is supportive. Consultants have flexibility and autonomy in meeting client needs. Benefits are generally good compared to other companies.
good,Constant changes as new organization is being formed. Friendly staff and creative ideas in work balance programs. Fast paced and very busy culture. They care about their staff.
good,"Nice place to work. Most of the work is contractor type, so security is always a concern. Good pay and benefits. The people are friendly and willing to help. Training is provided for company policies, etc."
good,Great comany to work for and would recommend to anyone looking.  The only issue I had was being in a niche field and no opportunities becoming available after my contract expired.
good,Maneja excelentes programas de benedicios para los empleados
good,"Leidos is a good company to work for and offers a variety of benefits.  There are opportunities for advancement at times, however, it can be difficult to be allowed to leave a department."
good,"The company is a good place to start your career. The possibility to grow is existent, but not widespread -  all depends on your manager's will to promote you. Surges of hiring are often followed by layoffs. Good work/life balance and benefits."
good,"As an Occupational Safety and Health Analyst at Leidos, I developed, implemented, and managed the Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Program to effectively mitigate risk. I was instrumental in identifying opportunities for improvements and instituting controls that ensure achievement of EHS objectives.  I learned valuable logistic skills that greatly developed my work efficiency. On my team there is great workplace culture that allows for excellent team work. Being away on constant travel was the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Leidos is a great place to work.. Benefits package is favorable to those with families.  The work place is quiet and professional.  The management if fair.
good,Strongly recommend employment with Leidos. It has a need for a broad range of skill sets that allows one to attempt new responsibilities. Good environment. Good benefits.
good,"Every day is a new challenge, I learn more and more as days pass by. I have learned a lot since day one since I started working in this field and have gained a lot of experience in linguistic field."
good,I enjoy working at Leidos. A typical workday at my work site was very active from start of day to finish.  The hardest part of my job at the job site was dealing with work politics. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with.
good,Work at this facility can be difficult at time as the government entities often times have agendas that do not align with industry best standards.  This makes work difficult at times as I want to do the best work possible to support our government.
good,"It is basically the same as working for Lockheed Martin. Especially since LM merged their IS & GS division with Leidos. We had the same great group of colleagues. Unfortunately, Leidos failed to win the government bid for the Desktop Support contract."
good,Daily rounds of data gathering and uploading from critical equipment. Interaction with Management and Staff to remedy any operational issues as they arise. Word closely with Information Technologies Technician to ensure smooth Data provisions.
good,The company was great but we had very few people in my field which resulted in a mountain of work that could get done but not in ample enough time.  Management said they understood but was not proactive in hiring more people.
good,I really enjoyed working at Leidos. The management listened and cared and the employees were professionals. The pay and benefits are what I expected from the shift work and I felt fairly compensated.
good,Great work life balance in a customer focused environment.  Benefits are on-par with industry standards.  Very collaborative environment.  Not very receptive about remote work.
good,"I have learned a lot about Homeland Security and the mission of the Center for Domestic Preparedness.  The environment is enjoyable but the company falls short of meeting my income requirements.  Parallel positions pay 3,000 to 5,000 dollars more than my salary. Increases have been slight, 1.25 % to 1.50 %. Working for a contractor is not secure. When the contract went through re-bid, my position was dissolved. Some people lost their jobs, fortunately, I was placed in a new position. When there is a government shutdown, we don't work and don't get paid, however, you can use any paid time off and flex holidays available."
good,Work was remote and generally stayed busy with client site responsibilities. Excellent at paying your expenses on time and system was easy to use. Team was excellent to work with.
good,"If you are technically proficient, you will advance without any issue.  If you are not a programmer, however, career advancement is much more difficult."
good,"Leidos is an excellent company. They provide top notch benefits and are extremely flexible with work schedules. The travel you do for work takes you to, in my opinion, beautiful places. There is some down time occasionally, but it isn't hard to find things to keep you busy. The only issue is training. There is not any training provided, well any quality training. It also takes quite some time for them to get you all the materials you need for your position."
good,"Company does encourage a healthy life/work balance, encourages a 40 hour work week and discourages overtime. Advancement within the company is difficult however, due to the large amount of competition. Compensation is not fairly balanced (i.e. employees with a H.S.diploma make more than someone with a college degree, etc). Other employees and management are enjoyable to work with, the company is global, making it easy to find a location to work within."
good,"As a employee of this company working overseas, I had the pleasure of meeting all kinds of people while assisting the military community. Loved working here."
good,"Good place with flexibility and supportive management. "
good,"On site Contract Executive Assistant: Calendar management including the conference room for classified briefings, meetings and teleconferencing. Management of the classified suite along with the civilian security officers; scheduling travel for team both within the US and International; processing re-imbursements in a timely manner; making sure security clearances were forwarded to meetings outside of the Department of Health and Human Services i.e. congressional hearings, Department of Homeland Security; Centers For Disease Control, etc.; review correspondence for signature by senior leadership; prepare all aspects for conferences US/International.

Ensure audio/visual equipment is serviced on schedule; liaison with IT Department regarding the service and upkeep of department computers classified and unclassified. Projects: forward invitations, prepare materials, and take notes for approval and distribution. "
good,"Great teams produce great results. Had the pleasure of working with some great teams, but sadly the economy let us down and many of us were separated. Really fun working with like-minded engineers though!"
good,The company culture is about the employee and the company offers great resources to help with your career and educational goals.
good,I cannot review Leidos fairly since Lockheed Martin IS&GS only just merged with them 2 months ago.  I have worked at a customer site at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds since 2011 and do not know much about Leidos Corporation itself.
good,"Rewarding whent customer is satisfied and give us kudos."
good,Leidos is a great place to work; it offers flexibility in my daily work needs as well as a great learning environment.
good,"Good company to work for, with good work/life balance, great new CEO.  Comp is good, benefits are okay, advancement opportunities and job security not great."
good,"Fun, relaxed atmosphere in which to work. Heads down type of work is expected, but managers and co workers are great people."
good,Loved my job and manager.  WAS a great company to work for while I was there.  Was able to work remote due to being a dedicated employee who showed production of work.
good,"Work hours are dependent on the customer and contract.  The time required to work is very flexible.  Co-workers are a wonderful group of people to work with."
good,"Atmosphere in the workplace makes it a rewarding experience to come to work everyday. Management is respected and company hires very well qualified personnel."
good,Leidos Biomedical Research is a very cultured work environment you get to work with people from all over the world . Working for the company they do research on HIV and Cancer your learn a lot and see things be grown from cells.
good,"Great People and Great work environment.  Although work can be extremely inconsistent.  My past department was sold to Tetra-Tech and although I'm still employed with them they haven't had work in 3 months because work is seasonal as we do audits for cleanups for natural disasters and it's been a slow hurricane season so they have had no work.  "
good,"Great place to work. The pay is really good, the benefits have been better. I've had good managers and I've had horrible managers. One thing they tell you about when you get hired is that the opportunity for advancement within the company is great. It can be quite difficult to make that happen at times."
good,This is a great company to work for. We are exposed to a variety of contract types and proposal preparation.
good,"Working at Leidos is great experience.Can drive to make the client decisions making faster "
good,Really relaxed environment to work in. Good work/life balance. Management will help you in times of need. Flexible work hours which is good for when you have kids or unforseen incidents.
good,"Productive and respectful work environment. I would recommend to anyone to work there. Company and leadership were respectful and educated.  Based on my solid academic background and experience, I believe I was a viable and well-suited candidate for the Leidos team. In closing, I believe I was well-suited to support and be part of the Leidos educational research team. The position supported my personal and professional goals to continue providing research and curriculum development and also provides support in the field of Homeland Security.."
good,Co-workers definitely make you feel like you're a part of the family.  Majority of the people are helpful when you need help. Definitely a family friendly environment.
good,"Normal 8 hour day with breaks, workplace culture is good, the hardest part really isn't hard just time consuming writing proposals and bidding on new contracts."
good,Leidos overall is a great place to work. I love the flexibility that the company offers.  Workplace culture is great as it tries to be inclusive.  They fairly compensate for the work you do.  The only negative I have for this company is the management.  I think some managers could benefit from learning how to become better people managers.
good,"Leidos provides a large number of opportunities and as a Solutions Architect or any Engineering you have a lot of flexibility to work new efforts.   Additionally, the organization is big on adherence to company values, ensuring strong employee satisfaction, and ethical behavior.  Since the merger with Lockheed IS&GS the company has demonstrated increase focus on value, as well as, services work focus.  Although it is primarily a services company, it does not minimize the need to innovate and grow it's advantages in the technical areas to improve quality, lower cost, and win business."
good,"I completed build of scheduling orders, powerform and Message Center Pools with configuration  "
good,"No complaints, great company to work for. Paid holidays and PTO, they work well with military to ensure you are accomadated when away for training. Not a toxic work environment management is responsive to concerns and they address issues in a timely manner."
good,Individuals are THE core component representing the Company's interest. They are THE face the customer sees everyday and are THE Strength the Customer relies on.
good,"Leidos is trying to compete with their old parent company, Lockheed. It’s a good company but they underpay - installers in Leidos make about 5 dollars less an hour than those in other companies."
good,Productive and interesting place to work. This where I began my journey in Cybersecurity. Working in the Security Operations Network opened my eyes to cybersecurity.
good,"Okay company to work for. Mature, project level leadership. Advancement and assignments are based on knowledge and job performance not on social friendships."
good,I enjoyed my 7 years at Leidos. Management and leadership responded to concerns effectively and in a timely manner. Worklife balance was a priority within the company.
good,"The company values people who can commit themselves to projects requiring several complex solutions and brilliant minds to implement them. The company maintains a firm stance on ethics, employee advancement and dedicated service to clients. Employees will often find a number of useful resources provided by several of their internal colleagues in the spirit of consistency and camaraderie."
good,"I work at an offsite, so I really don't have much interaction with the company culture outside of site visits on occasion from the VPs. Yearly merit raises seem to be very restrictive."
good,"Good Environment, Good Culture, Big teams,Many different systems,Large IDIQs with differnet agencies with fifferent contract types. Recompetes are in progress."
good,"My typical work day is usually pretty busy supporting two senior executives, their direct reports and team members. Daily tasks include report and document preparation (using MS Suite applications), calendar and travel management, expense reporting, answering and directing calls, and several other common administrative tasks.  Additionally, I provide management support to include ensuring supplies are stocked and ordered, arranging maintenance, and overseeing logistical requirements. I have progressed in this company from a junior level receptionist/administrative position to the most senior administrative billet supporting the CEO.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the amazing team of professionals I am so fortunate to work with."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Leidos, which is so far around two years.  It was a good start, I'm looking for a different position now as a means of diversifying my work experience."
good,Nice place to work - you have to be a good fit - good work environment - people are friendly and willing to help - supervisors are understanding and helpful
good,"This was a contract position. Leidos had the Entergy Co. account. Then a Bid was brought by HCL, and Leidos lost the contract. I then had to re-apply for my position."
good,"generally a positive experience. was not employed long enough to give a thoughtful review."
good,Leidos is a great place to work and provides an excellent culture to thrive both professionally and personally.  Company is very conscious of a work life balance.
good,Leidos is a great company to work for. They are fair and committed to give you the best environment to work in. The benefits are wonderful and management are very helpful
good,"Great management team and co workers. The work environment was awesome and people were very helpful. There was always room for training and job improvement. Leidos offed many different way to improve your position with in the company. Leidos truly knew how to take care of their employees and offer them many different avenues for advancing your career.,"
good,"Leidos is an interesting company with many government contracts. Sometimes there is inconsistency in what the client wants, but the employees do their best in meeting the client's needs. My position was freelance, so I was able to set my own hours as long as I accounted for my time."
good,"Started out as SAIC and became Leidos after a split.  Great locations (Reston and Chantilly, VA). Flexible work hours, Opportunities for training, several opportunities per year for networking and getting know your co-workers."
good,"When I was no longer able to work for Leidos they helped me look for work elsewhere, even with competitors. The pay was generous and they found me temporary work where possible. As an intern, I learned so much."
good,"Leidos is an engineering consultation firm that specializes in the energy utility sector, as a CAD drafter I am tasked with creating survey drawings for documenting the replacement of utility poles. The work was fast paced and could be hard to learn at the rate at which work was required , it could be difficult to verify if certain things were correct as our project lead was located in another state . After doing enough of these drawings it was fairly easy to get the hang of."
good,Leidos is a great Company to work for.  They have flexibility and the culture is great.  Leidos offers a great compensation plan also offers bonuses every quarter.
good,"Everyone in the building is always willing to help, good workloads and reasonable expectations of what work must be completed. Great benefits and overall work environment"
good,I have been employed for 10 years at Leidos.  I started off as a Training Coordinator and was promoted to a Training Manager.  Our small office in Baton Rouge works on training Law Enforcement officers around the country via mobile training cadre's.  This is a very  small part of what Leidos does so there is not much room for advancement.  This job is very fulfilling because we are training Law Enforcement officers and first responders how to better protect the community that we all live in.
good,"Worked with Leidos Health for a short time after Lockheed Martin merged their IS & GS division with Leidos. After the bidding process with the Department of HHS, Leidos did not win the contract."
good,Healthy working environment. Good benefits and flexible working  environment. Strong Technical capability and excellent work ethics  Good Company to work with.
good,Good company with decent benefits.  Flexible work hours.  Very good PTO structure.  Solid 401K program and provider.  Ability to work from home or remote when needed.
good,I enjoyed my time there.  The only risky thing is working on a contract that may end soon and the company may not have a position to put you in.  All in all management looks out for the employees
good,Management at the Fort Worth office are the best I've worked for.  Open doors to everyone and amazing communication with employees.  Strong team to work for.
good,I work with a great group of people.  Benefits and company culture have changed and not for the better. Heavy workloads but manageable. Highly recommended for security professionals.
good,"My Leidos management team is really great.  I'm contracted to a customer and work at their site, so the environment is not really a Leidos environment, which is ok.  My only contact with my management team is phone and electronic, but we are still in constant communication and aware of everything going on with our projects.  Assistance is always available, but I've never felt micromanaged in any way.  Occasionally, and when necessary, I am able to work from home.  The ethical standards are very high.  I can't even imagine anyone at Leidos behaving in and inappropriate manner... that's just not the way they work.  Their main priority is customer - make the customer happy, do your job like you're supposed to, and they are happy.  "
good,"Not a bad place to work. I have worked here for a couple of months and it's ok. Not sure why I have to write a hundred and fifty character paragraph, but am trying"
good,"Good assignment. Did a lot of telephone conferencing. I enjoyed my assignment.....we were subcontractors to MANTECH."
good,"This is a contract position.  This particular position is shift work with a rotating schedule every 3 months.  Operations are 24/7, 365.  You will have to request holidays off.  "
good,My company was merged with Leidos and we worked to integrate our payroll and benefits processes into theirs.  Definite learning opportunity with new systems
good,Heirarchical - very little matrixed work so your work is clearly defined and your roll up to the corporate goals is clear.  CEO leaves a lot to be desired as he could improve in his emotional intelligence as well as improving his composure.  I left knowing that the culture flows from the top and I no longer wanted to be exposed to that demeanor.
good,"Workplace culture was at the client site, therefore, a typical day at work was completing the tasks that were assigned to support the client.  The most enjoyable part of the job was not being micro managed.  However, management was not aware of the day to day accountability aspects provided in supporting the client and their expectations."
good,"There are advantages to working with a major, but there is always the risk of loss of contract coverage.  They try to keep good people, especially with clearances, because it costs them to turn them over. Management is fine, but if you work on the govt customer site, you don't hear much from them."
good,Leidos is a great place to work if you are ok with not advancing.  They give nice raises and pay well for the position that you are hired in at.  The only problem is that they rarely promote.  Otherwise it's fantastic to be working for a cure for cancer and to get published so often.
good,"It's a government contract."
good,"I was with Lockheed until just a few months ago, but so far it has not been the worst. I know people that have been with them longer that love the company."
good,I have seen a very good and friendly work culture here which made me to get interacted with the senior managers without any issues. This made me to learn the interaction how we have to do with the top level management.
good,"Leidos is a good company to work for ."
good,I have enjoyed working at SAIC/Leidos for the past 12 years and the management has been great to work with. The only reason I am leaving is that I am moving back to San Diego because my husband got a great opportunity out there.
good,"Fun environment. Met lots of great people and made good friends, but also remained productive and learned a lot. Fully able to advance my career. No regrets in the work place."
good,Leidos is a very good company to work for.  CEO on down management is very supportive. Coworkers also very helpful. Just beware if you work under government contracts. Job could disappear instantly.
good,"I can't say much of Leidos since I haven't experienced much, I've only been apart of Leidos for a few months now since they recently acquired part of Lockheed Martin."
good,"Not much to complain about, great place to work, flexible schedule, nice managers, but you have to put up with government bureaucracy."
good,I enjoyed working with Leidos staff.  I was able to use my best judgment to complete my work.  I was able to work remote when needed.  I still keep in touch with people I worked with.
good,"A typical day at work includes preparing close to 15 detailed, compliant invoices a day.  This includes, but is not limited to, acquiring and providing backup documents such as Excel spreadsheets, expense reports and subcontractor invoices, preparing government-required documents, maintaining an accurate calculation of funds available for billing, and insuring documents are submitted in a timely manner.  As this company is primarily Government contracting, the absolute requirement is compliance.  Contracts must be analyzed and followed to the letter.  I enjoy working here as there is never a loss for something to do, and every contract/""job"" is different, requiring complete attention to detail.   The biggest challenge to this job is the same thing... there is never a dull moment!  I work with many people as this is a big office, and all of them are professional, dedicated employees.  The management is willing to support, train and step in when the need arises.  Although they are all very busy, for the most part they still find the time."
good,"When I interview for a company and meet happy managers, I know it's a nice place to work.  First impressions are lasting ones with me.  I just wish they had more opportunities in Maryland.:)"
good,"Great place to learn, the benefit of meeting different people, learn to the world . Management is willing to help you work retated issue.  the hardest part is calling high rank officials, the most enjoyable is frinday payed lunch and early dismisal."
good,"Great company, great workforce, ability to grow and further progress your porfessional career. Flexible work schedules was a beneficial benefit."
good,It is a good company with good compensation and benefits.  Suitable   equipment and tools are provided to fulfill my job description.
good,"As an employee working at a customer site, my management is very hands off and helpful when I need them. Lots of free online training available in addition to company-supported education opportunities for career advancement if you ask."
good,"A great place to begin a career.  Many great leaders, regardless of the type of work they perform, are part of the Leidos team here."
good,"This is an organization which is demonstrates caring and professionalism by offering educational benefits so that employees can help with bettering the quality of service provided to the customer. Just the few months which I've worked for this company every day has been a pleasure to come to work due to the nature of the project that we are currently working on, the team all work together as one and the management encourages creativity."
good,Independent work environment.  Learned a few new products in my field through work with clients.  The management is there when you need them. There is little interaction with co-workers due to the nature of the job but all have been quite friendly. the hardest part of the job is the travel away from home.
good,Leidos is a good company to work for. There is possibility to advance but the pay for lower ranked jobs can be lower than the average.
good,Excellent workplace and flexible work schedule. Outstanding managment
good,"As a consultant with Leidos Health, there is no such thing as a ""typical"" day.  Job duties and locations are forever changing and you must think on your toes.  I have learned how to better manage my time and to work with different personalities. "
good,I have always worked at the government client site.  The company program managers are hands on.
good,"great Manager, which made for a great team. "
good,A good company with very competitive salary.  Management lets you do your work with little interference.  Good training opportunities and people.
good,"With the recent company split only time will tell."
good,Quality Management that helps and have concern about employees.
good,Only problem is this job isn't for everybody. Must be mentally tough because of all the traveling and preferably single. Traveling is awesome but taxing. Must love touching computers and troubleshooting.
good,"Working at Leidos is very flexible for the most part. You can choose the time you want to come in and leave as long as you get to 40 hours, but as a systems integrator I have to sometimes do testing in the lab which are split into 6 hour shifts and require reservations. Each day is different depending on the tasks you are assigned, but generally I would check emails first, read over technical documents, develop test procedures if needed, and perform testing in either a lab or developer environment. Leidos is a very large company so management is not the best, but co-workers are always very helpful if you are given an assignment from higher up that may not have been explained well. "
good,"There is always something new and challenging everyday. Friendly environment, great location.  Wide variety of customer base.  Overall good company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed the people at Leidos that I worked with. The work was interesting, and relatively easy paced. They are a government contractor. I did not enjoy the government shutdown."
good,Leidos is a great place to work. It was my first contractor job after my military service. I felt that my salary and job opportunity was on level with the skill set i came to the company with.
good,There is a lot of daily work and requirements at Leidos that makes the day interesting and go by quickly. I enjoy the work I do here and the people are amazing.
good,"It is a great place to work in Florida if you are part of the Utility group. Not sure about other areas.  Flexible hours, comfortable work area with stand up desks."
good,"Leidos is a good company to work for, There are a lot of opportunities, They do a lot of things to encourage employees.  I have worked for 7 years and I have enjoyed the company"
good,Very laid back work environment and flexible schedule.  Great for a couple years but the career advancement promises that are never delivered and lack of advancement gets old.
good,"Nothing bad to say about this company, managers treated everyone with respect and provided the right amount of direction.  worked for Leidos as a government contractor. The management was always willing to work with us for issues like government building closures to ensure we wouldn't be on the hook for taking vacation time to account for closures. I am currently trying to transfer within Leidos and patiently waiting for a position to open at our new location because I enjoyed my time as a Leidos employee at our last duty station."
good,"Leidos will throw you right into an assignment where your not sure you'll succeed, this may seem harsh but, the support you are given and the bright minds that surround you... you will soon find that you can accomplish even the most frustrating assignments."
good,I really enjoy working at LEIDOS.  The work is interesting.  The most enjoyable part of my current job is being able to grow technically and to have the opportunity to solve technical problesm
good,This is a great company to work for. Having been here less than 2 years I have learned a great deal. Many trainings & learning opportunities. Typical workday is definitely fast paced.
good,Provides a balanced work environment where employees are challenged and provided upward mobility based on skill sets and performance. Management cares for their people and provides generous benefits.
good,In my position the typical day was going from site to site and visiting customers and resolving the technical issues they had with the program I was supporting.
good,"Working with Leidos was interesting and enjoyable work, but due to their inability to guarantee successful contract negotiations, I choose to leave rather than risk not having a job in the near future."
good,"Benefits are good. Schedule flexibility. Be ready to work, and have the ability to learn, everyday is something different and you must be able to adjust to new trends in your career track."
good,Good place to work. People are friendly.  All workers are respected and treated fairly.  Good ethical values.  Great management team. Very good HR programs.
good,"Great place and people to work with. Most of the employees are enthused about what they do and highly professional. However, there are a few stragglers that give excuses."
good,"Overall great company to work for, friendly environment, advancement opportunities, moving in the right direction."
good,"Standard day is I come in early, drink some terrible coffee, read e-mails and fix any problems my customer may have concerns about. Our customer is the government and we typically have quick communication with them. Some days I will spend the entire afternoon sitting in meetings that I probably don't need to be a part of, other days I can be left to do my assigned work. "
good,"I worked in the client's office, so I really don't get to feel a part of the Leidos job culture. But overall, I love the people I get to work with. I'm more influenced by the client's job culture than that Leidos'."
good,"Coming into a Fortune 500 company, there are certain expectations. Leidos does well at exceeding them. They have excellent opportunities to learn and be promoted. They take care of their employees as best they can and mangers (in my experience) are willing to let you do more to learn more which in turn allows for career growth."
good,"Its a morning job with flexible hours as long as you worked 8 hours. You have to take care of laboratory animals, feed, clean, and check their health status."
good,"A typical day at my job is very low key. I have assignments that I work on and management allows me the flexibility to do my job without someone constantly looking over my shoulder. I know when my deadlines are and I usually complete me tasks earlier than requested."
good,"We started at sun-up but the work was not exhausting as long as the paperwork was in order. I monitored the workers to make sure it was done properly and in the places that was assigned to us.the work continued until sun-down, then close up for the day!"
good,"I truly have nothing bad to say about this company"
good,"One of the best large companies I have worked for. Very good leadership and enjoyed the disciplined documentation. Loved my co-workers and their dedication to exemplary performance. Personal character was the highest."
good,"Leidos Health has delivered health IT services and solutions to more than 900 healthcare organizations across North America, and supports nearly every federal agency focused on healthcare in the United States. In addition to the implementation, integration, and optimization of large-scale health IT systems as well as all major EHR vendors, our services include enterprise solutions focused on high-level initiatives such as Meaningful Use, ICD-10 transition, IT strategy, revenue cycle management, and, cybersecurity."
good,"This company was a good place to work.  I enjoyed the work done daily supporting the military in Afghanistan.  Management was, personable, supportive, and helpful which made the work day seem easier.  The hardest part of the position that I held was working in a hostile deployed environment."
good,The most important part of my job is that I am able to solve customer problems in a timely manner
good,I work with an awesome group of talented people. Management seems to be flexible to schedules (working from home/standard work times). See below for company Pros/Cons.
good,Has been a good company to work for over the past 13 years. Company always tries to look out for its employees even when a contract goes away from under them.
good,"The job was great! The coworkers and bosses worked well together, and we traveled all throughout the country helping the clients to the best of our abilities. I learned a lot at the job."
good,"Supporting the state of MD electronic land record system. Ensuring that the production environment is working at full capacity, staff is nice and easy to work with. Great place!"
good,Good people to work with a good atmosphere making a fun work environment. Good communication between the supervisor and everyone that I work with and with the customer.
good,It was a team effort on all projects that were part of the TMPC environment. Great collaborative efforts were demonstrated. Each day was invogorating. The team experience was outstanding.
good,"I do not consider myself in a position to judge Leidos at this point, since I never considered myself a good fit.  Like any place, it had it's advantages and disadvantages, but I had a good run there, and the management was fair."
good,Leidos was a great place to work. They bought  out my previous employer (Lockheed Martin) and continued operating our contract almost exactly the way LM did.  It was a pleasure working for Leidos.
good,"Very flexible with work environment, great work/life balance - time off between proposals - can work from anywhere depending on your job, great coworkers"
good,Productive workplace.  After the workday you feel you accomplished a goal set that day.  Coworkers are very welcoming.  Management encourages employees to advance.
good,"Great company to work for, very helpful employees and down to earth always ready to help you if you are stock. The managers do not macro manage. You as employee are free to work independently or in a team if you choose to, as long as you meet your goal and timely delivery of your task you are good. The compensation based on my talks with the staff are great."
good,"An excellent form to work with. They provide professional consulting services, mostly to government agencies. Contracts come and go, mine happened to go."
good,"Management is lost shoots from the hip with the first sign of trouble. They threaten you job for the most minor mistakes, creating fear in employees for some of the worst Project Managers I've ever worked with."
good,"The company itself is pretty decent. The pay is outstanding while overseas; however, as soon as you take vacation you do not get paid while on your minimum 30 days vacation."

good,"I've enjoyed it and have learned quite a bit from the other people I have worked with. Sadly, contracts do not last forever so it is time to look for new opportunities."
good,I've had a great experience working with Leidos. Our proposal management team was a reliable supportive team to work for. Our supervisor was always looking for ways to improve our work environment and encouraged training and learning new skills.
good,The job allows for incredible growth. A positive attitude is a requirement on a small team in a deployed environment. You can apply yourself as much as you want but may not be compensated for the contribution.
good,The time in this role was stressful as part of my team was busy on software development and delivery and another part was coordinating an IT move to consolidate our team to one floor of the facility instead of two.
good,at leidos I was working on the FAMS contract and was the network engineer responsible for FAMS network. did all the work on routers switches firewalls to keep the network operational.  management was good and it was a great place to work.
good,Leidos treats all consultants with a level of high regard. Respectfully speaking they are my most preferred company to work with and would be eager to do so at any time depending on contract availability.
good,"Overall, the experience with Leidos was good.  They decided not to pursue the type of work that I was interested in and no-bid the contract renewal which was my primary reason for leaving."
good,"none to discuss was not employed long"
good,"Excellent Company, I've worked for them for many years on multiple contracts.  I'm happy with my position and I'm only posting my resume in anticipation of future contract change."
good,"Great manager, wonderful people to work with. The clients are Members of Congress and their staff utilizing proprietary CRM software to communicate and engage with constituents on policy and service related issues."

good,This career allowed for independence to be shown and he ability to lead in an fast pace environment.  The company allows you to grow and improve for movement in he company.
good,Just transitioned from LM IS&GS to Leidos and so far they have provided great support.  Do not know enough about the company to provide a more detailed review.

good,"Like working for a small company, with all the benefits of a large company.  Good  work/life balance.  Lots of advancement opportunities."
good,"Leidos, Inc is a great place to work as a Government Contractor.  They have always treated me like one of the team, one of the family and with respect.  I would recommend them to anyone looking to transition out of Active Duty into the Contracting world."
good,Excellent company. The company provides the usual benefits expected of a Fortune 500 company. Our division definitely takes care of their personnel.
good,"Very Nice Work Environment to work in.Consult with users and evaluate requirements, recommend designs, provide cost analyses, plan projects, and coordinate tasks for installation of data networks.Primary technical contact for critical issues for a global Intranet application.

good,Great Company .. advancement is reachable as long as you work hard.. dont be afraid to tell them what you want in your career...................................
good,"When I first started working here in 2010, it wasn't that stressful and it was a really nice place to work but when the company split with SAIC it seemed to go all ""downhill"" from there. It was all about the ""bottom line"" and little regard to the employees. The stress was unbelievable and lots of overtime to get all the work done. Upper management did not listen to any of the employee suggestions and eventually the AR dept was moved to the Tucson, AZ location after many years of speculation."
good,"The accounting department was relocated from Omaha to Tucson in March 2014, I began in the journal entry team which was the team that maintained and updated the general ledger. In 2015 I moved over to my current team, the service center accounting team. This team is constantly changing and growing. We adopted the processes given to us by the Omaha team in 2014, and have been streamlining and improving ever since. Our management team values a work life balance therefore anything we can do to improve a task and make it more efficient to minimize those late work days they are open to suggestion."
good,Overall good place to work since it was outside contract most of the interaction was with the client rather than with staff members.
good,"Good company to work for but unfortunately it was a temp job."
good,"Leidos Biomedical Research is an excellent company to work with. They provide autonomy and wonderful career advancement. Salary is competitive. However, benefits, especially vacation and sick leave hours, are very minimal."
good,The duty of the cook was to Prep all toppings make dough from scratch roll pizza out to keep from bubbling top pizza cook cut serve then sanitizing the store and start again.
good,"I Love what I am doing. I learned lots from Leidos."
good,This is a great place to work. The employees are great and the overall environment is somewhere i would recommend to others. I have been working here for a few months.
good,"Leidos was a nice working place. My boss, co-workers were vary cooperative. We all worked as professionals. We worked on an ammonia project which was a difficult project."
good,"Busy day with contracts, visitors, dealing with managements, we are able to enjoy the flex schedule, the relaxed atmosphere in the local office"
good,"Great overall company, very well positioned for the future. Individual projects tend to be bogged down by out of date management practices (project management) and don't see the benefits of using Agile in the workplace."
good,"The Leidos experience was exactly the same as my Avanade experience,  a productive and fun workplace with no ping pong table, except the pay was a tiny bit cheaper.  Ping pong tables were in another room in the building.  Escort Operators to the Fairfax Cloud experience needed USME and CJIS clearances to enter the Operations Center (NOC).  With access provided by the Escort Operators, they observed developer sessions as they maintained the Fairfax Environment, stopping sessions if any passwords or connection strings were exposed (causing a security incident)."
good,This is a great company to work for. The pay has been not good since i know they have underpaid me tremendously. I have been told of a promotion but yet received one yet. We need more hands on with the tools given.
good,"High Paced environment where you must be willing to adapt, daily at times. Management is visible and supportive. Overall professional growth and advancement is very possible and doable at Leidos."

good,Great group! Many complex efforts to sink your teeth into. This company is good for training and advancement. Great bonus and recognition for hard work. I enjoyed the people.
good,I enjoy working at Leidos Biomedical and for the most part it is a great company.  The only negative thing I would have to say is that there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement in the administrative side.
good,Excellent set of skilled workers. It is a really friendly environment. Flexible working hours are available including working from home when approved.
good,"It was great until it sold out the Design Build division,  then layoffs occurred."
good,"Great staff to work with and enjoyed going to work everyday.  How to perform duties for persons that really apreciated my services.My manager and co-workers were great.  Not a hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  Unfortunately, I do not have a driver permit/licenses. ."

good,Ledos is a good place to work it has a very professional atmosphere. The people in the location are kind the place is clean and the work is very interesting .
good,Leido feels like a start up even though it been going for many years because it hasntbuttoned down a lot of processes and direction. This is both a good thing because you have opportunity to shape stuff and bad thing because it can be frustrating
good,I prefer not to speak on my experience at Leidos. It has been again a learning experience and would recommend to others.
good,"Leidos has an excellent inter-personal culture for it's employees. Leidos is a growing defense contractor, who is managing their growth well and balancing that with employee caring and culture growth."

good,Leidos is a great company that provides multiple avenues to broaden your horizons. The opportunity for advancement is very high here and the atmosphere is very welcoming.
good,"My issues with my current position is my commute.  Unfortunately, I cannot relocate do to the limiting time remaining on my current contract.  Other than that, Leidos has been fair and supportive of my career."
good,Leidos is a great place to work.  They are very extensive with there training and make sure you are prepared for the position you are in.  I enjoyed my time at Leidos and would go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,I loved working here.  It's a great company.  This company has offices all over the world.  It's the biggest Fortune 500 company that you've never heard of. They dabble in all aspects of technology and cutting edge systems for almost everything under the sun.
good,"Would love to work for them again. I happen to have a horrible experience with my direct superior,  but everyone else was top notch, professional, and an example of what leadership in every company should be. Many work events, fundraisers, and employee appreciation opportunities, as well as very competitive benefits and leave options."
good,"Professional environment--respects everyone.  Teamwork is key to success--everyone has something to contribute.  Management is caring, fair and supportive.  Workplace culture inspires high standards in ethics and to provide best services possible, while having fun doing it."
good,"Management was great at Leidos. However, working as a contractor for the government was stressful. Limited advancement within the company. When leidos split from SAIC was more stressful and raises and advances were less."
good,This was the most laid back atmosphere that I probably will ever work in. I absolutely loved working for this company and am sad to have been laid off due to a contract coming to an end.
good,I cant say enough good about Leidos. I have worked here for ten years. The management structure is great and you are recognized for the work you do. The benefits could be a little better but they are not bad. They could offer a little more but you will be covered on all fronts.
good,"Leidos went through many changes and  sometimes not informed.  The culture also became more cut throat as time when by.   I did not want to leave, lack of work was the primary reason for leaving."
good,I have been withy Leido's since it was created by a split from SAIC Corporation.  The work is varied and many opportunities exist for growth.

good,"Leidos is an excellent company to work for.  Very interesting applications developed for the customer,  I am working at a customer site with contracts from a dozen different companies.  In this environment, it is hard to describe the Leidos culture."
good,"During my duties OCONUS, I always felt the CONUS team had my back and took care of me despite being halfway across the world.  I only had a small taste of the culture at Leidos (it was SAIC at the time), but I enjoyed the small, almost squadron-like feel when I was back home.  Despite my contract with them running its course, I would be happy to go back to work for them."
good,"Typical day consisted of reviewing all-source message traffic and consolidating into usable information for long-term products and briefings. Trained a six person team on the job functions to include the use of Microsoft Office and Outlook for the production and dissemination of materials. Hardest part of the job was the ever-changing requirements for production. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of providing a quality product for leadership to make key decisions. Overall job experience with co-workers was great, we all got along and even got together after work on occasion."
good,Most of daily duties included vulnerability management and mitigations
good,"I did and always have enjoyed the time that I spent with Leidos, as a contract employee staying consistently employed has been a challenge, not to say that it was unusual but something I wish we could have worked out."
good,Leidos is a great place to work.  I love the team that I am on.  We work together on resolving issues and consistently support and build each other up.
good,"I left a terrible organization (Charlotte's LYNX Light Rail) and a month or two later I got onboard to a TEAM! Although the team is geographically separated we enjoy the ability to reach out to one another during difficult times in the field. The culture is relaxed and you are compensated well because of OT, mileage (.54/mile) and per diem. Generally speaking base pay comes in at market value for your area but the added benefits more than make up for it. Sign up immediately for the benefits program. Discounts are insane!"
good,"The work day was very packed, and I was often there a little late."
good,"Wonderful management, quick paced environment. Met and coordinated with people all over the country. Learned a lot of applicable skill in traveling and meeting new people. Overall a good company. Contracting life can be stressful when contracts come up for renewal causing uncertain futures."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Leidos, the company is very large which makes interacting with corporate difficult at times.  The specific contract I support has been exceptionally rewarding."
good,"Leidos branched off of SAIC. The organization is experienced and structured. The management were amazing, and I loved working there. I did see where they could have promoted from within and did not. Also, there were many years worked without a raise. Otherwise, I gained very valuable skills working for them. I would work for them again in the future."
good,"For a consulting firm, they have it together.  From the time the recruiters call you about an opportunity, they lay it out, and follow up when they say they are going to.  Clear hourly and wage discussion are followed to the T.  Never an issue with time or payments, and billing personnel to work every angle to get your expenses approved.  Nice intranet with every necessary app you can think of.  Great IT support.  Nice company."
good,"My first job as a contract employee."
good,"One of the best place to work for DOD  project.. Flexible, able to work from home of needed be. Team mades are very helpful and understandable. Excellent management."
good,A typical day at Leidos was always fun.  There was always a new study or project that someone was doing.  We were always looking at ways to improve the last project
good,"Great co-workers, organized work structure, good opportunity for advancement, and appreciation for hard work."
good,"I currenlty work in a very fast paced,sometimes stressfull enviroment, but enjoy every moment of it.  I have learned a great deal on leading a team and also being part of a team.  Both are fulfilling and very necessary roles.  The hardest part of my job is trying to maintain the heavy work load required to reach company goals while training a team of new hires. The best part is watching the new hires that I've trained and mentored become successfull."
good,"Love my job, my bosses and my team all one big happy family!! Great benefits for my family and the 401k and profit sharing are all very competitive to the market place plus the annual discount on buying stocks!!! Win win for all come to the Leidos family you won’t regret it!!"

good,"Great place to work, loved my co-workers and my Management.  If they had won the contract renewal, I would still be there.. If I had a problem, I would bring it up and my co-workers or management would work to resolve it.."
good,"Coworkers are great, work environment is great. Can be stressful at times, but that is everywhere you go. Mission comes first. Sometimes management is difficult to get alone for a meeting, best to email and set up a calendar invite rather than in person."
good,"I enjoy the flexibility of working outdoors.  The company was great, I did get a chance to work with great people and wish the position had last longer as I was going through a temp agency Aerotek, however I definitely would apply directly for Liedos again for an advantage and seek out additional opportunities, my suggestion is to do your research and find out what works best for you."

good,productive place to work with great people and management job gice you chance the grow by involing you in new projects that have impact changes to new software development
good,I enjoyed my time with Leidos and had the chance to build good relationships within the work environment I was assigned to. If I had to do it all over again I would.
good,"Leidos is a science and technology solutions leader addressing some of the world’s toughest challenges in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, civil, and healthcare markets."
good,I worked for Leidos as a government contractor. The management was always willing to work with us for issues like government building closures to ensure we wouldn't be on the hook for taking vacation time to account for their closures. I am currently trying to transfer within Leidos and patiently waiting for a position to open at our new location because I enjoyed my time as a Leidos employee at our last duty station.
good,"During my time at Leidos, I was exposed to a very diverse group of people. Management held many events for all employees to attend and frequently provided snacks on holidays, such as Veteran's Day. The structure of the business itself was very well maintained and professional. Overall, Leidos is a terrific place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking to work in the technology field."
good,"Great company with the current customer. There is room to grow and gain insightful experience within the IC. I am using my exact skills I interviewed for and very thankful for the offer last year. The workplace, the culture and fulfillment of the job is very rewarding."
good,Productive and fun workplace with excellent and professional co-workers.  I experienced an easy work atmosphere and enjoyed the flexible work hours when needed.  The hardest part of this job was being laid-off after 85% of project completion.  I like to complete a project whenever possible and I do miss the friends I made while working there.
good,"Leidos as a company is relatively new but it carries much of the culture derived from its old structure SAIC.  The area worked was primarily in support of the Department of Defense.  It is a good company to work for with competitive benefits to other defense contractors.  In our location, people enjoy coming to work and supporting their customers."
good,"There are a lot of moving parts to Leidos health, but the training is great and provides you everything you need to get through any task. The company was great for helping me hone my time management skill and provide clients with optimal support. Though the amount of thinks to learn was overwhelming the team made sure I had all the necessary information and tools to accomplish my tasks and duties."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was I learned and worked with linux systems."
good,"Great Place to work, very supportive of career growth and very flexible. I enjoy working with my mentors and learning from my colleagues. I wanted to advance in the company and my manager was very happy and supported me the whole way through the process."
good,"A great employer given their tough business. Serving the intel community has gotten way harder and that is hard on all employers and employees in that space. The post sequestration world includes ""low cost technically acceptable"" awards versus ""best value"", and buying manpower on multi-prime IDIQ contracts that were designed for buying printer paper. Rates have gone way down and you now see people abandoning their clearance to go commercial - you never used to see that. The post Snowden world includes security folks who are paranoid, badly overworked and having more than their share of dim bulbs. All in all very worrisome for national defense. For Leidos, the drop in rates has caused them to drop their contribution to benefits, and salaries are OK but small companies can offer better. The problem with small companies is that they have few contracts and if you are bumped off one you will likely be gone very, very quickly. That happened to me when I worked for MasterPeace Solutions. After two months the owner had lunch and said he wanted me in a leadership spot with up to 8 people under me. That was Wednesday. On Friday sequestration hit, the contract I was on lost 11 people, I was the second newest on the contract and I was one of them. On Monday I was told best of luck. From "" we want you in management"" to ""don't let the door hit you on the way out"" in three business days. Small companies just don't have the overhead budget to keep people very long. At Leidos I lost my spot on a contract and they tried very hard to find me spots on their many other contracts, and kept me on"
good,Great opportunities even for a contract company. Be prepared to be just a number in most instances. Insurance is not that great.
good,"Leidos has carried over most of the old SAIC work atmosphere, but with the new CEO improvements are being made constantly to ensure that Leidos is the best place to work."
good,"There was a corporate buyout and merger in 2013. This has left the original maxIT-VCS in shambles. But, the people are great and will help you every change they get."
good,Worked a contract for Wounded Warrior and enjoyed the opportunity to continue serving after my active duty retirement
good,"Work hard, play hard would be a great motto for Leidos. I have encountered so many happy, relaxed, fulfilled people in my time here. I couldn't be happier."
good,The company values its customers and employees both.   It is a great defense contractor.
good,This is the top best company in United States over 45000 + employees.
good,Enjoyed the Army and the lifestyle. The days were long but enjoyable.
good,Leidos is a great company to work for. It offers flexible work schedule and great team work.  It does have great 401K compensation and carrier advancement
good,"This company applies what I call a whole person concept where your work, your advancements and the balance of your work with your life is important.The company culture reflects this ideal by examples like individuals donating their leave to others in need and by the events that the company organizes to make working for LEIDOS not just about work."
good,Was Deployed to Afghanistan and Leidos paid six months differential pay which was completely unexpected.  They treat you like an adult and let you work without being too much in your business which is a nice change of pace from many places I've worked.
good,"Always a lot to learn, but it's very rewarding!  Working for amazing management always makes any job better no matter what. You really feel valued and appreciated!"
good,"Great company to work for, with a culture of employee development and retention.  Always open and available, the junior and senior leadership is there to help their employees always grow and development."
good,I worked for Leidos as an assembler and enjoyed the work.  It was a good place and I thought at the time I was going to continue working there.  What happened was a government contract did not end up going with Leidos.
good,"Leidos is a great company and there is no stress in the workplace."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Work with domain experts on cancer and biomedical research. Collaborative environment. Able to work on different type of projects to answer real scientific questions.
good,Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks.
good,"Leidos is a good company to work for.  It is continually picking up more business with the most recent purchase of Lockheed Martin's IT contracts.  The company offers great benefits.  However, the salaries are not competitive with market salaries and find that employees do not remain long term and often bounce from contract to contract to return to Leidos to be compensated for a higher salary range."
good,"This was the best job I have had in my career, met some of the nicest people and I am lucky to call them my friends to this day. The benefits were exactly what I needed."
good,Always tried to meet my needs and help me advance in my career path. very supportive and understanding of my needs and wants. Has helped me progress in my career path.
good,This company allowed me to utilized both my educational and work experience. They allowed me to grow and thrive and become better in all areas of my career.
good,I have been with the company for almost 9 years.  They offer a great benefit package and work very hard to place and/or keep people.
good,It is a progressive company.  The management gives you the opportunity to grow with the business whether it be education  i house or training on line.

good,"A typical day at work would consist of working tickets via the Remedy ticketing system from anything related to the Adobe Connect application including desktop application support and network related support.   "
good,"SAIC started out as an employee-owned company.  The employees took this very seriously taking ownership of their job and worked diligently.  We were all family, working hard to advance the company and along with my co-workers we interacted with each other through the good and the bad.  I made several friends from coast to coast in the U.S., Czech Republic and the U.K.  The hardest part of the job was when the company had to make the business decision of restructuring and lay off many of the most talented employees in Orlando and across the company."
good,"great place to work, flexable and people are great. Unfortunatlly the new government contract changed and staffing also did. They are very helpful in my new employment serch"

good,The company holds its employees to the highest expectation of work performed. Management has a finger on the pulse of employees which is refreshing. Working environment is not high pressure
good,"Laid back company with a personable leadership and cast of employees. The company offered very good benefits and plenty of employment opportunities. It was a pleasure working for them, although my time was cut short with them."

good,Leidos is a terrific company.  They highly encourage professional development and provide opportunities for specialized training.  They understand the value of work-life-balance.  It is a very ethical company with outstanding values.  It is a company that I am proud to say I have worked for.
good,"Leidos was a great company to work.  Due to my husbands job transferring is the only reason I left. The work environment was awesome as well as my supervisor and there were open doors to move within the company.  I wish there was a way I could have transferred to Warner Robins, GA."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working there, it was a lot of travel for the project but the pay was good, benefits kicked in really quickly and it was a environment that a technician can grow and rise."
good,"Open diverse culture that allows for advancement, opportunities and where the company believes and invests in its employees. Benefits and matching 401k are comparable to other like large businesses."

good,"Its was great, flexible hours, the co-worker was nice, training was not hard, and I could work 40 hours within 3 days. Leidos teach me news skills while i was there. Like how to pack and shipped boxes. Different technique to scan and index information. Typically we are support to scan or index 1,000 per day.
