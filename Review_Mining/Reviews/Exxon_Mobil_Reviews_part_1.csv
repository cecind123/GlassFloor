rating,review
bad,I have learned many different skills and chose no to continue my employment due to lack of opportunity.  Low pay no benefits lack of appreciation. Constant new ownership or franchised stores.
bad,"I was working 20+ hours overtime each check, simply because there wasn't enough people working. I was the only employee ever on my shift. Besides that, I was in the hospital at one point for chemical burns from a gasoline spill, I had to wait two hours soaked in gasoline before someone showed up so I could leave to go to the hospital"
bad,"Job Culture in ExxonMobil is ok "
bad,Manager is unprofessional was told there's no seniority so she gives the good hours to the people she likes and you can never get ahead was there for a year and a half never called in or missed any days still kept me on nights and weekends any new people she hired she put on days
bad,The store is always dirty . The manager aways using profanity to employers it’s like everyone manager they self I would not recommend nobody to work there
bad,"Manager play favorites, there were no breaks, and the one time I had to go to hospital they let me go saying I abandoned my job, would not let anyone I know work there!"
bad,Poor leadership from safety management with insecurity from the team. Lack of communications and site awareness with project managers and engineers. Played favoritisms among the staffers and contractors and not performing on corporate mentality (ethics/morals) levels when it comes to leadership style. Instead fixated on clique mentality. If you’re not part of the team then you’ll be removed.
bad,"It's Poorly Ran Very Stressful "
bad,Management was very unprofessional and rude. They were never considerate of others time and ability to operate facility. I do not recommend working for this company. The pay does not equate to the work that is expected to be completed by the end of the shift.
bad,The manager was very careless. The products in the store were all expired and he never showed up to the store or answer his phone. He would hire women who dont speak English (even though most of the customers only spoke English) and give them your hours.
bad,This place is not a good place to work. There is no teamwork. The owner is a joke. Plenty of code violations in this store but no inspector ever comes.
bad,Management was bad. Meeting new people was the best part of the job. Nothing was hard about the job management just was terrible and unorganized. I learned nothing from this job
bad,i ran the front greet customers and rang up sales and restoc what was needed for the night and close hard part was me staying behind doing everyone job
bad,It was a very bad place to work. People were never on time and instructions were very poor. The manager didn't know what she was doing and a lot of the time she was late getting in to relieve me.
bad,"Just an awful experience overall. I do not recommend working here. If you do, just make sure that management doesn’t give you an attitude for no reason."
bad,"-Poor management. They will publicly berate and embarrass you. "
bad,"If youre trying to support yourself off of one fulltime job, this isnt the position for you. 12$ hourly before taxes, no breaks unless youre a smoker, no lunch break, just on your feet all day for 12$hourly with no benefits. Also ExxonMobil is a climate change denier because if green technology were brought to the forefront it would drive down their bottom line and kill profits for gas. So in short,  theyre morally bankrupt and dont give a single rats toocus about any of their workers because we are all replaceable cogs in their oily death machine. Ps, all the food they sell in the gas stations is pumped full of filler and sugar, all youre gonna get from it is temporary hollow joy followed by a full day of wet farts and bacne."
bad,"Although I was able to get along with the owner, they were a very poor company to work for.  I was micro-managed as the store manager and not given the proper credibility."
bad,after I was hired store owners sold the store. new owner knew nothing about how to run a gas station.  I worked 7 days a week for months to help with the store to be fired and replaced by his family.
bad,the hardest part of the job was the like the more I work hard the more the manager kept jumping down my stroat with something and I latterly got fed up with it it was to the point wea I got accused of something I didn't know anything about like who didn't filter the grease and the time I was on the shift I did everything I was suppose to do because that was gocos was paying me for and I was doing evet=rything I was suppose to do and needed to be done like if the chicken spoiled she write me up I didn't have controil over ythe cooler not keeping that chicken fresh I was very dissatisfied how I was treated on thatjob and the wasn't even worst my time just being honest as I can be!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Working at Exxonmobil was a very disrepectful experience. My managers were terrible and they FORCED me to work unsafe shifts. I was pressured to work shifts I wasn't comfortable with, no benefits offered, and barely any safety at work when we live in a bad area. You work ALONE."
bad,The management was not very good not family oriented and unappreciative they do not like to give you days off nor do they allow sick time. I was treated very unfairly
bad,Sometimes i wouldn’t Even get paid the day I was supposed to. I would Have to wait days at a time. Almost a whole week after pay day to get paid. They were rude and very disrespectful to their employees and you didn’t get anything for work there. Hardly made money. Didn’t pay enough for what i had To do.
bad,Its not a good management . I dont like it . No career.  Bad manager. So attitude of mAnager . Better leave this job . No benefit . No vacation.  Nothing
bad,Created and improved upon bid documents and contracts.  ExxonMobil has no experience in lump sum turnaround work.  It was very difficult.  There was no commitment by the personnel to change from a T&M approach.
bad,"Fast turn around, owner very judgmental and brings employees into personal affairs, professionalisms isn’t a behavior utilized by owner or office employee (family), expected to go beyond expectations only to be treated poorly ,little pay hourly ,will replace to for very small issues ."
bad,"Got nothing to say. other than the manager was really good and he well was educated and a good friend (work wise), i really didn't like the pay less then the minimum wage, worked there for a while cuss i needed the money asap till i could off find something better."
bad,Det är jätteviktigt att arbetsgivaren skapar ett bra arbetsmiljö och säkerhet.
bad,"Management thinks they know better, Third shift cannot and will not be covered if you are sick, so come in on your hospital bed and spread your disease on the food you are forced to prepare because morning shift kitchen staff doesn't show, but still has a job. Night shift is left to pick up the slack from first and second shifts. No raises, ever, no benefits to speak of, and allow women to work alone at night with no help. Tasks are overwhelming, no way in the world you can get all the stuff done alone with customers all night long. It is one of the worst jobs I have worked in over 20 years."
bad,"Very boring and stressful environment which deteriorates  your self-esteem and confidence. No raises whatsoever and the managers work you as a mule. For the records, I worked in a gas station where you cannot sit at anytime. you need to be standing the whole shift time."
bad,My work experience at Exxon for the first two years were good but when the previous owners sold the station the new owner alot worse manager. Had to leave for better pay.
bad,the exxon I worked for was a privately owned one and had poor management plus very bad workers. they need to have the place shut down and corporate needs to take over
bad,"They did not offer raises until 5 years of employment. Have no opportunity to rise in the company, Employees are not appreciated, they only recognize when you come short on the rare occasion I did."
bad,The company lacked any real training program. The staff was highly combative and unprofessional. Management was more absent than present. There was little to no structure or direction provided by management or the employees.
bad,Never go there. It’s shut down now  I never would ever recommend them to anyone or send them business they sold out to another company and let everyone go
bad,Run & don't work at this cut throat place.  Cut throat & no one likes to help each other.  Management is only concerned with preaching what is in writing and getting to advance their own career.
bad,Management was terrible they were rude and unprofessional to employees. Racism played a major part in working there and it effects the work place when you are being judged.
bad,"Exxon is not a good place to work. They doesn't pay fair they steal your things, the food isn't even good ,and the management sucks, there rude, i hate it"
bad,"A typical day is spent cleaning stocking store as well as helping customers behind the counter and on on sales floor, interacting with customers is best part of job worst part is you work your butt off and really never go anywhere."
bad,"Management was rude, and did not treat it's employees fairly. Assistant manager was stealing from cash register. Assistant manager verbally and physically abused me. Owner told me it was my fault. NOT a good place to work at."
bad,"location is closed now, family owned business that was shut down and rebuilt into a different gas station. I would not recommend working with family and this location is no longer available"
bad,Just as before I would not recommend anyone working at a gas station. The only benefits are the variety of customers that you receive in the store.  I am a people person.
bad,the management at exon was horrible. the employees never knew what to expect for the manager. Poor communication between management and employees. To be honest if you don't have to work at exon avoid that store at all costs.
bad,I trained what i thought was my new assistant manger they gave her my job (manager). I did both roles for quite a long time then let me go w/o reason.
bad,"This company is highly unprofessional, the employees are underpaid and treated very poorly.  They are very discriminating, I have witnessed incidents such as employees stealing and the owner being aware of it and doing absolutely nothing about it, and then witnessed it again and someone finally being punished for it. They play favorites, so instead of doing what should have been done with one employee they allowed it since they favored them more."
bad,Family culture .. no experience manager with nasty attitudes .. everyone telling to get to the top .. can grow unless you kissing the operation manager
bad,The owner of the establishment had a very bad habit of micro managing anything and everything. Making it very difficult to manage at a managers level.
bad,"Its a Job at a gas Station unless you are management/owner and getting paid where you can live life comfortably,did you will be happier  but anything else its just a job to do, I do not want to spend my life or  2 years for working for exxon"
bad,The store is fast paced and was running smoothly till the new owner took over and he caused some problems and alot of people ended up quitting their jobs
bad,"Management poor "
bad,nothing but complaining and drama not worth it. You could work anywhere else and be so much happier with a decent pay check. I repeat anywhere else is better than here.
bad,"I have worked in the industry for 35 years, in every refinery located in a 60 mile radius,exxon is the rudest place I have ever worked. You are looked down upon with every step you take. I would encourage young men and women to not start out there career with this company.They do not reflect the type of environment I would want my son or daughter to work in."
bad,Company was constantly laying people off and raises were not existent. Management was overly strict and employee interaction was very impersonal. Company did not seem to care about it's employees.
bad,No breaks...too hot ...rude customers and too many manager changes...High over turn rate in management. No understanding or appreciation for their workers..to many chiefs not enough indians
bad,worst job ever the manager was mean it all about favoritism in that job I had no experience they only trained me for a day and then left me alone with no supervision the a week later they fired me cause there not what I was looking for if there training was better then I would of stayed there
bad,Good employee morale with recognition of employees and motivation.   Good benefits with flexibility when needed.  Top 500 fortune company.  Always room for advancement.
bad,"A typical day at work was performing management duties that were delegated by incompetent supervisors, supporting large engineering groups, including expats from Angola, making complex travel arrangements, securing passports and visas, supervising and training interns, and scheduling meetings, securing venues, requesting AV equipment, and ordering catering"
bad,Everyone here with the exception of a few were contractors. Not a fun team atmosphere. Not all of the chemists worked with the same level of commitment or integrity.
bad,"Working alone, overnight, was the absolute worst thing I have ever put myself through, I am a social butterfly and need to be around people, talking, communicating, in the presence of another human being. I was by myself from late night to early morning and I will never ever put myself through it again."
bad,it was a good work place until I started beig mistreated by co-workers and management. I was left to do the other shift duties due to me having graveyard.
bad,"The boss in this case is not the CEO of Exxon Mobile but a regional con-man who bought a gas station with the franchise rights. "
bad,Store never closed and employees not showing up for work at last minute.  No support from territory manager.  No personal life.
bad,"I learnt so many things working here I enjoyed the customers and the coworkers,i enjoy the job to its fullest,i was taught so many things there"
bad,"This store got robbed 3 times I was there. I ran the cash register, stocked shelves. I was not there long because of bad neighborhood. It was a temporary job that I am glad I got away from. My co-workers were great to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people that past through traveling."
bad,The manager here was rude and didn't let you ask for anything like days off.
bad,"Don't work for the company, silly childish US petrol company! That have been sniffing petrol fumes."
bad,I enjoy the customer service part of this job and my customers whom i have made friends but the management team is very unstable.
bad,The manger and owners as well as the supervisor where all unprofessionally. The work place was never safe and the pay was horrible i would not recommend any one to apply or work there. 
bad,"I unloaded trucks and did maintenance. They had bad hours, nasty rude coworkers. Most enjoyable part was quitting time."
bad,"Everyday @ work was joyful, the customers would never allow you to have a dull moment. I grew to know & learn my co workers very well. The hardest part of the job was not being treated fairly."
bad,Just like many other large corporations this company wants the most work while providing the least pay and benefits.
bad,they will not let you go to school and work. the boss was always hitting on you and trying to fill you up and we are the same sex.
bad,Very poor place to work. They offer no advancement opportunities. My co workers are fun its just the indians I worked for that made the place a boring place to work.
bad,horrible pay
bad,"Exxon management works you very very hard and avoids giving out raises. If you have children it's not the place to work as there is no work life balance. Management is stingy, stern and very micro managing. The company is very wealth, but offers very little. You can't even own their stock as an employee. Exxon employs mostly contractors to avoid giving benefits to full time permanent employees. Employees at Exxon live in fear of doing the wrong thing and getting fired as the threat of getting fired is always in your face. They guard you like a hawk and monitor you coming and going."
bad,"Serious lack of training. Hostile work environment. No room for promotion based on age discrimination. Management threatened peoples job, shouted and postured in an aggressive manner."
bad,"Checked in cash drawer, lotto and supplies. Customer service when customers in store, cleaned and cooked. Worked over night so tasks included: taking apart and cleaning cappuccino machine, filling water bins, making ice bags and cleaning the pumps."
bad,The manager is very discriminatory against males and everyone gangs up on people they don't like including the manager overall a very bad place to work under paid and usually under worked if they don't like u then no hours
bad,Would not recommend any one who is looking for a career in this company. I was treated like I didn’t belong when I was a hard worker and didn’t get no recognition.
bad,"no good would never work for Mobil unless you are getting paid at least a living wage. Poor management, came and went whenever they wanted and expected you to stay when they were late EVERYDAY."
bad,I worked for exxon i was used by the manager only to get her assisant back and forth to work and if i didnt my hours got cut.Very pour managment was hired for one shift and never got.And some of the crew was great.while others lacked and was made to pick up the slack.I would never recommend anyone to apply .The only satisfaction was the enjoyment of my customers.That was the only Pros about the job.I ciuld go on about all the cons.But dont have enough space.Oh and never got a break.nor do they have good benefits
bad,"A typical day at work would involve coming in doing a shift change on the register and cleaning and stocking whenever we didn't have customers. Our store manger was a good person and employee but the territory manager was not a good employee. I didn't learn alot while i was employed there, The most enjoyable thing about the job was all the customers i got to know and see everyday."
bad,"Worked with the EMIT group in the Edmonton refinery.  The interview was for a tier1 position and in reality it was a Project Managers position.  Safety is ridiculously high...papercut involves days of paperwork.  Was let go because rear passenger in vehicle did not have seat belt fully locked.  Server room is a disaster and was nearly electrocuted 3 times along with the raised floor being damaged and ready to fail.  "
bad,"Crecimiento Profesional? Depende de si le caes bien o no a tu Team Lead/ Supervisor y Gerentes... y aun asi implica estar en la empresa minimo 7 años! "
bad,Slave wage. Assistant mangers are being promised assistant manger pay and months later still being paid the same as the cashiers but doing more than even the manger including coming in on their days off to cover no shows.
bad,"On Exxon Mobil Corporate. They are a huge company. They have a very specific media campaign on how they want things done and how their employees are to reference them outside of the office."
bad,"I am certain the company means well, but they treated me horribly. Their “training” was ridiculous and not even relevant to my job. I worked with people who were not approachable, unkind and not open minded. The protocol there was like working for a government institution."
bad,I hated working here the management is horrible they target certain employees to get them to quit they lie and make  up stuff They are inconsistent with the schedule rules are not made clear they have horrible communication.
bad,I loved to work there but stressful with schedule and employees. Employees should be serious with workplace rules and focus on work environment separate personal life.
bad,"Normal job "
bad,"I went above and beyond to try to impress my manager's,  unfortunately I did not get any kind of feedback. But I did provide excellent customer service every day I was employed by Mobil Speedy market"
bad,"Needs new management at the location I was working. They don't want to pay you enough, even after I was promoted to shift lead & safety lead (which came with a lot more responsibility) I was still only paid 10.50/hour. I did my manager's daily paperwork, checked in vendors, checked gas pumps, held monthly safety meetings with the entire staff, operated a cash register, loaded/unloaded the safe & so much more."
bad,If you do Great at your job and your not related to or blowing someone in the company you will be let go. I've never worked for a more unorganized company in my life. Terrible people all around. Would smile in you face then stab you in the back.
bad,Terrible place to work. Management cares only about themselves. Would not recommend this organization to anyone. Long hours and expected availability even on weekends.
bad,"It's been very rough, I've had to work 16 hours a day, 5 days a week for little to no pay. I guess if you were an average Cashier member it would be much easier but as the store operators son who was short on workers and money to hire new ones my life has been horrible working here, I greatly wish to find a new job soon."
bad,The hardest part of this job is the lack of management skills from the general manager. There is no structure to the store polices and regulations.  Overall work environment is not a healthy place. The best part is the customers.
bad,"Clock in get straight to work, start helping customers, count cash. Management is unconcerned with employee issues. A few recent robberies occurred and the manager refused to show up for every one."
bad,"Sexist environment, Promises are not kept and no health benefits."
bad,great employees and supervisors the environement was a fun based company
bad,Very poor management and people talks about each other very often. Feels like you are back in high school. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,Customers are great  easy job basic gas station job  their schedules are unpredictable  employers  s&s Petroleum that are horrible to their employees and managers
bad,"I gave 34 years of my life to this company.  Working all kinds of hours on any given day including weekends and holidays.  On call 7 days a week 24 hours a day.  When you get old, they just kick you to the curb.   Wish I left years ago.  Have a much better job now with a much better work/life balance."
bad,"Working at Exxon as a contractor you learn very quickly that you are a second class citizen. You can and will be fired for if an employee decides to talk to a first line supervisor. In my position I got to be ignored pretty blatantly which allowed me to hear tons of conversations about the many contractors who were ""let go for performance"" for reasons like ""hes a b word bro"". I remember once I over heard a conversation between two guys talking about ""I miss the good ole days when you could just take a contractors tools home and no one said anything"" what is that? If you want to be treated like less of a human being until you are eventually let go then this is the place for you. "
bad,"The owner was very careless. He would use the restroom with the door wide open, while not only me, but customers were in view! Refused to pay time and a half for overtime. Was never on time. And I was let go due to the owner being to lazy to count the change in the drawer, so in his eyes I was short."
bad,Do not work here your co workers snitch you out if they dont like you.  The work is not hard but because everyone is miserable they want to make it harder for everyone else.  Management are snakes
bad,Use this as a stepping stone to a class 1 railroad. It is a great place to learn basic railroading skills that will translate to the bigger railroads.
bad,Most people were captured by the benefits then counted days to retirement.  Things changed so often there was seldom any continuity and always lack of connection to a common vision for the company.
bad,"The majority of IT work has been migrated off shore.  If you are in Calgary and are in the oil business, there can be a career for you.  If you are looking to relocate outside of Canada, there can be a career for you.  But this once solely Canadian owned and operated company (Imperial Oil - Esso) is now simply a source of oil for a giant American Corporation.  Stay away."
bad,They force to much pressure and stress on their employees. During contract days reminds me of the 50's where segregation was the way of life. Great day and stess relieved when I quit
bad,"Day one in offshore location i learned the policies of management for the platform, good relationship with my co-workers."
bad,its a job with no benefits as in health insurance or vacation or sick/personal days
bad,"Es muy difícil trabajar con automovilistas, la falta de educación y la prepotencia instaladas en nuestra pobre cultura hacen cuesta arriba el trabajo de cualquiera que tenga que lidiar con dichos individuos, y mas aún cuando la empresa en la que uno trabaja, no lo respalda."
bad,"not very friendly working enviroment, heavy schedule and not enjoyable."
bad,Ask me and I will tell you personally... I really thank the company for the opportunity but really bad experiences not with customers.................
bad,The management levels are after personal interest at the expense of the law. Some unscrupulous individuals are involved in nefarious activities to enrich themselves. They prove to be well connected with who is who in the society. If you show concern you could be victimized.
bad,"They have all these safety rules and the don’t follow them.  I worked at the Beaumont, Texas Refinery and it falling apart.  They patch equipment up rather than fix them.  They won’t let you transfer to be closer to home.  Not organized at all compared to the plant in which I came from.  The trainer I had would rather sleep instead of training me.  Totally a good Old Boy System. If you kiss butt you good."
bad,Was a dedicated employee for 7 years and I was going through some medical issues and was not fit for work I told my boss while in tears but I was fired shortly after.
bad,I wasnt getting enough hours they was talking about me behind my back .................... Also the manager went to another store that i was getting a job at and say things about in front of customers n employees
bad,"I was a Terminal Supervisor at the Everett Facility. I loved the job and yet the management created a horrible work environment. Other facilities that had good management treated their employees with respect. The Everett terminal could have been a great place to work, unfortunately management ruined a great working place and downsizing the management team created a work environment that deteriorated through the years.  Great company. Horrible management."
bad,Not worth it to have to deal with the injustice acts that take place with in the company! Dirty to the core!! Also you must be vigilant about keeping track of when & howl ong you worked for everyday & altogether at the end of the pay period cause if ur insure there's a good chance u might not get paid for the entire amount of hours you actually worked during the pay period.
bad,"ExxonMobil was not a good fit for me. I like having some semblance of control over my career, and this company offers none of that. There are no internal job postings; rather, there is a committee that decides when and where you move. They claim you get a say in it, but it's considered ""career limiting"" to say no. They LOVE the phrase ""trust the process"", which is complete nonsense. The process works for a select few, and if you don't fit that mold, it's useless."
bad,"Exxonmobil pretty much is the good ole boy system, racism is running ramped but it is hiding through planted people of your own race put in place to stab you in the back. Make sure to document everything you do and everything people tell you so you can have proof after the knife has been stuck in your back."
bad,I would not recomendó to anyone  this is the worst job you can get the management is rude and the customers are no better I have to clean up fecies from the bathroom walls about every week
bad,"The culture at XOM is terrible unless you're an engineer.  Then it's pretty good."
bad,"Being a contractor here was the worst idea I ever had. No room for advancement, no raises and no paid time off. Don't bother taking a job here unless it's as an employee."
bad,"Most people spent more time on Facebook or craigslist than they did working on projects for the company. The amount of time that people spend on coffee breaks is insane and completely ridiculous. Lunches are 30 minutes, but if you go for two hours or so, no one will say anything to you. There is no accountability at all."
bad,"the management is totally unprofessional, they do not provide the training that they say they do. They gossip and scheme against each other. I am even owed an Avon order for months from one of their employees who choses not to return my call, after multiple calls and messages. I have asked her to mail either my product, or return my money and she has done neither one."
bad,"It was an alright job, could’ve had been better. They were usually under staffed and if not they’d hire to many people. I wouldn’t really recommend anyone for the job"
bad,Limited advancement and ranking system promotes cut throat culture.  Very little respect as a research technician even though most have advanced degrees.  Most supervisors have limited education and show favoritism.
bad,"People are lazy, cut throat & back stabbers. Worst environment I have ever worked in and I've been working for well over 30 years for many companies since a teenager."
bad,"Simple job, weirdos at night Graveyard management great, flexible hours "
bad,"The manager there is slimy. He talks about his employees behind their backs. He lies to all his employees. He stars drama like a high school girl. A typical day at work is a long 8 hour shift where you stand there and for the most part get horrible customers. You have to side work which is easy, however, the managers will never be happy with it and will always complain about how you did things. 90 percent of my co workers were annoying and never did any of the work. The hardest part of the job is everything. The only enjoyable part of this job was meeting a couple new friends during this. Do not work at this gas station."
bad,"when i first started it was a really pleasant place to work,... then i met the owners and site supervisor. extremely rude individuals, highly judgmental of ones physical appearance and even sexist. not saying all locations are the same but the location i was in was horrible currently has a new store manager, but that really doesn't make much of a difference. ."
bad,It was a nice fun experience to work there at the time. We only had one boss there and he was ok to work with. All in all I learned stuff that I never did before which is a plus.
bad,"The job culture is horrible and it is a accident waiting to happen, training curriculum is horrible, equal opportunity is horrible, and being a Veteran does not mean anything"
bad,"This company is so full of bias.  They promote safety but sweep everything under the rug when something happens.  They force employees to participate in a safety program that is only on paper.  They require excess overtime, working 13 on and 1 off.  The management has no clue of the company policy and procedure and therefore make up what they think is the best.  Culturally, there is a diverse workforce, but contrarily, there is a large amount of reverse discrimination. The only enjoyable part of this job was the pay and the hardest part was dealing with inept management."
bad,I enjoyed working there. It was a very fast paced job and I enjoyed everyone I worked with. The management is very difficult to get along with however the employees were amazing. There was very little room for learning mistakes.
bad,I loved working at exxon but the management was horrible and non professional. I loved my customers but didn't to much enjoy my fellow Co workers
bad,"Non Applicable"
bad,The employees are all respectable enjoyable people. Someone you can get along with. They do there jobs. I really liked working with everyone there and i liked my job im just ready for something different
bad,Majority of the Exxon's are owned by cheap Indians who don't care about their employees safety. They're are no benefits. The customers take their frustration out on employees because of the poor functioning equipment.
bad,you have to work that by yourself at night time and I think it should be two people working with you at night time just in case anything happened I just think it is very unsafe to be there
bad,"The company will not consider one with a criminal background. No matter how long ago the crime took place or if the crime is non-violent. As an engineering major, I was extended an offer only to have it rescinded a month before the start date."
bad,ExxonMobil is a great company for a very energetic and highly skilled person who is wanting to make their mark in the corporate world. It is a difficult place for families as the dedication required to succeed will come before anything else in your life.
bad,Very disorganized operation with little to no direction. Imperial oil is a very one sided company who values  favouritism  And bowing down to the management on their sites in order to keep you position no matter what you are. I spent many years on imperial oil sites but their Canadian operations (Fort McMurray) I would rate absolutely about a 2 out of 10.
bad,Owner was terrible and didnt even live in the same state. Customers expected five star service at a tiny town gas station. Prices in store could qualify for highway robbery
bad,"It is not worth the time and effort to go into how bad it was working at the Quincy Exxon. Fact of the matter is they go through emplyoees faster than any place else I know of in my area, that is how bad it is there."
bad,"A company whose ethics and morals revolve around the almighty dollar. Spills to the water and injuries are not uncommon. Great culture on paper, but reality paints a different picture."
bad,"Great people to work with and for. Pay isn't the best, cant keep up on your bills with just this as job. Boss was awesome. It's always fun. There are some people who work there that refuse to do their job correctly and efficiently. They tend to stay on their phone and not help customers. You have to yell at them to come help."
bad,"This company is not one i would advise anyone to work for. To work in a full service gas station this was just a mess. The customers who frequented made my days but, co-workers and management forget about it."
bad,"•	One of 10 members of the LINUX development Operations Team that oversaw complete Exxon UNIX environment."
bad,"It a good place to work at and i got to meet alot of people. Friendly place to work everyone i work with it nice i learn more skills how to use the casher, do inventory"
bad,my typical day consisted of checking and completing the daily log. I learned how to manage time effectively. The management was eager to help teach me everything I need to know.
bad,"I found it very stressful to work under the management at Exxon, but I love my job and enjoy the customers. I kept the store clean and always stocked, cleaned the bathroom, and helped out next door at subway."
bad,"While I've worked with many foundations, most of them are merely tax write offs and there is no genuine concern for the downtrodden. The Whiskers Foundation REALLY cares"
bad,"A typical day at work "
bad,the best way to describe my experience at ExxonMobil is simply buyer beware! The culture or environment of this company is smoke and mirrors. No one in the department I worked in actual earned their position. This made for a lot of miscommunication and essentially no competence. The employees are given tons of restrictions. You almost had to ask for permission to use the facilities. Everyday was a nightmare .
bad,I started to work at exxon as a temp enployee. after working there for 7 months in total i took the employment test and they wanted me to be a mechanical engineer to work as an operator and i thought that was dumb.
bad,"Coming from a smaller company, it was a hard adjustment in realizing that a company really didn't care about you personally.."
bad,"The place is very good but the salary is very little."
bad,"There is a good experience in working with exxon & zadco joint venture project in abu dhabi ,UAE. Management is supportive and encouraging."
bad,"One of the worst places I have worked for. The manager that hired me was phenomenal and the only reason I enjoyed working there. When they transferred her to a different store, and brought on a new manager, the whole store went to garbage immediately. The new manager dressed in tank tops and made every vendor uncomfortable. Was verbally aggressive with employees. And came to work high every day."
bad,"Refresco gratis donde sabías a qué hora entrabas pero no salias, donde no tomaban en consideración si estabas de acuerdo o no, donde le daban más oportunidades a personas que no sabían lo que hacian pero al traineer osea yo nunca pudo crecer."
bad,My last year at Exxon was dismal and even though I was a high performing individual they did not engage me in any development discussions and decided that the best option for me was to go to a dead end clerical job.  When I refused I was literally bullied out the door and HR did nothing to support me.  So after 12 yrs service I was left demoralised by the whole situation.  Literally the manager was a complete bully.  So even after 10-11 yrs of happy service I would not recommend Exxon to anyone.  They don't look after their staff and treat those who have been loyal like dirt.
bad,"It was nice when I first started. Then when the owner fired everyone, I wasn’t being relieved in time for my other job which was becoming an issue so I had to quit."
bad,"This a is a good company to work for if:"
bad,The schedule was hard to manage because they were always short of people. Its hard to fit in their schedule when you have two jobs.
bad,"At Exxon, you're busy the moment you walk in the door.  I had the pleasure of working with a very pleasant manager; however, she was transferred to another group."
bad,"Overall a mid-level company, with in entry level positions people always get taken advantage off.  "
bad,I became a better people person but other than great customer service skills i really didnt get anything out of this job experience. After being bought by timewise we took major pay cuts.
bad,"The management is horrible, he’s super nice but he cannot read people for poo.  nobody shows up for their shift when they’re supposed to and the most reliable employee is always the one getting left alone for an 8 hour shift because of it. No one EVER cleans the bathroom, the store doesn’t even have tools to clean it in their utility closet. Other shifts leave so much work for everyone else"
bad,"Negative enviroment- Constant throwing of things, cursing at employees, and no work was ever full satisfied to their needs. Contacted management on this and they did nothing."
bad,"I enjoyed working here however, the manager was not very understanding in situations of sickness or health issues. I enjoyed all the tasks in which I performed most. Overall, it wasn't a bad expiereince."
bad,"Customers are very rude. They do not give a care in the world about you, dont expect them to. Very fast paced and stressful. Inconsistent scheduling. No benefits. Very poor raises. They usually already have their two fulltime employees so you’ll be part time. Its an okay starting job. Or as a temporary one. Not a career."
bad,"There really wasn't an interview process. I walked in asking about a job and was hired. After being promised promotion on several occasions I decided to transfer because they thought I was favored. After the transfer I was having to do extra jobs, such as kitchen and management without a raise. It took 10 months to get my first raise."
bad,This would be a bad place to work  told a friend of mine she has to quit eating and drinking she gained weight and he couldn't have ugly girls working for him
bad,"Very stressful. If someone was short an employee at a store, will call you in. Demanded your help from you in different departments. Wouldn't want to train to move up in the company."
bad,It was ok but lack of hours and pay and the manager was never around to do her part...But I deal with it because at the time I had just moved to mccomb and needed some type of work to help me .. But it didnt turn out right
bad,I will never work for another Mobil again. May not ever work for another gas station again because of the bad experience I had. The management had employee relations which caused them to move higher up. Disgusted by what is allowed to go on.
bad,"On a typical day you have stock count register do money drops. The most enjoyable part is meeting new customers and making the customers happy. Sometimes, when the store is crowed it can be a bit stressful."
bad,"Personally i feel like there are too many Managers managing Managers. EMIT Management does not backup their contractors during a dispute or employee complaints, contractors are still treated like outsiders instead of employees."
bad,working at exxon was a tiring job i was working full time hours with a part time payment i was only being paid 7.50 but i was working 8+ hours everyday. when i was only a part time employee
bad,"Hard working individuals supporting the XOM IT infrastructure, are released without advanced notification or explanation after having provided years (14) of exceptional service and support to their managers."
bad,Very strong company with a solid reputation as an industry leader. Working for a private company has a vast difference in SOP and guidelines.
bad,"Management favours local Czech people, training is minimum, colleagues were uncooperative. Very low salary, not enough benefits"
bad,The owners do not care about their workers one bit they could care less if you have children or sick family members but whenever it comes to them they expect you to cover their shifts
bad,"not a fun job that is a lot of paper work and more every day, if you are valuable to the unit you will never grow. you have to be a lazy person to get put on a day job!"
bad,You are belittled daily..no one ever shows on time and nothing is said about it..they put no thought into who they hire..it's more like a high school drama class than a work environment
bad,It's a very stressful job where you have to count and take customers.  Sometimes it gets very busy and you still have to count. Then customers get upset with you.
bad,The manager makes you feel 2in. tall even when your doing your best!..Co workers never showed up on time... would want you to stay over but not get overtime
bad,It has been good experience; but as a whole ExxonMobil is very unorganized and continuously procrastinates ways to improve the work efficiency.   They are afraid of change as an organization.
bad,I had a great time working there.  The work was easy and fast to learn. I enjoyed my days there and it was unfortunate that i had to leave from there.
bad,Worst job ever worked. Contacted by HR person who offered position knowing this was not going to be lasting employment which was not conveyed during interview.
bad,Work environment with most employees working here for more than 20 years. High demand in job with no supervisor and low salary increase and no agreed long-term career path.
bad,"Check out customers, Lottery scratches offs. Fill ciggerettes cigars, and sweep mop, clean drink machines, take out trash. Clean shelves. Count down Count safe."
bad,the work environment was a 5 out of 10.  no one took responsibility for their own actions and people were blamed without any cause.  highly uneducated management staff which produced a poor reflection of the Exxon company
bad,"I have been loyal with this company for a year, i have never been late, always clean, stock and aware of store maintenance, I have accepted inventory, learned how to properly file paperwork into the computer and was receiving 38 hours, After months went buy I am the only white, female person working I do not feel comfortable working in this atmosphere. I was also forced shorter hours not even making part-time hours. I live and pay all my own responsibilities and need to find a more stable company to work with."
bad,This was the first job I got when I came home from Colorado. It was a minimum wage entry level starting point. To much micro managing & drama
bad,"Someone wrote a review with the honest truth about this lab a while back...I should have heeded their warning to stay away from this lab but really wanted to gain the work experience. "
bad,Typical day busy. Learned how to use register. Management was poor. Co-workers was ok. Hardest part of job standing for 8 hrs (doesn't make any sense for any job to make you stand that long). Most enjoyed part of day was meeting new customers meeting different people from all over the world.
bad,"Wrost Company and management I have seen in my working experience"
bad,Exxon promotes a negative work environment with their employees and management. The was a since of bias at the facility I was employed. The Superintendent was very openly bias toward minorities and bullied the employees frequently. Would not encourage anyone to be exposed to this type of work environment.
bad,Before I signed on here at the lube plant I had several interviews at other ExxonMobil facilities. Since I took this job I can't get anyone to look my way.
bad,"It's okay if you want a part-time job. Nothing to make a career out of. The regulars are great, but it's the people behind the scenes that make the job not so great. If you just come and get the job done you still get talked about."
bad,"Working there is extremely stressful. You don't earn the proper wages for the amount of work piled on you. Unless you are in a higher up management position or ceo, expect to be treated like nothing. There is no job security due to constant turnarounds."
bad,"In my time at the store, the 2 years straight Ive worked here with no complaints never called in sick never been late, the owner of the store treated me unfairly and downright wrong most of the time. "
bad,Not for someone like me I'm 25 years old and dpnt need to be working a slow low paid job like this. If you honestly want to work here then good on you but honestly dont do it unless you're doing to it for just some money.
bad,"The convenience store side run by ARS, is a complete mess. The pay is too low to keep good employees around, management will promote and not complete the proper paperwork, the higher up could care less as long as the margins are being hit."
bad,"Working here is okay if you're still in high school. I started at $8.00 and I was almost at a year when I received my very first raise of $.25."
bad,"Overall i like the job, and the manager. Management just tried to keep the payroll low, some weeks i could get my hours, and others weeks i might get ten. But if they needed me i was always there to work, doing what ever they needed."
bad,"+ Colleagues"
bad,Management is unwilling to learn logistics/ warehouse. Tries to run the dept. like the military. Expect to operate in a safe manor and yet they put a strict time frame to get work done.
bad,"A lot of favoritism, many days I was token advantage of because of my kindness and work attitude. There was no drug testing therefore other employees would often cause negative customers who threaten the work place for other employees."
bad,workplace harassment from supervisors. you will be treated poorly by vindictive management. heavy military presence in regards to treatment and operations.
bad,when i worked there the company had just been sold. the new owners we hateful and treated the employees badly. they didnt understand english well or how to run a gas station. they would take advice on how we perviously did things
bad,"loved working there I was a temp, contracted ended, liked the position I was in & the people I worked with, wish it would have lasted longer"
bad,"This was not a great place to be employed if you have a family."
bad,I have a very secure job and I am at no risk of being fired. Other than that the job has done very little to make working there feel worth while. There is little room to move up the ladder and often work conflicts are left unresolved by management.
bad,"The New managers are not trained and expect you to do their job also,there is no raises or steps to move up.the customers are good and polite,but the managers don't interact with them as they should."
bad,"Engineering Manager sabotaged my contract extension after fabricating a trail of deception from which I was eventually exonerated. Manager purported a fictitious medical claim, and had a colleague feign that I had to be medically cleared before returning to work."
bad,"Los compañeros muy egoistas, todos se querian llevar el credito. No me daban mucha bola. El supervisor, malisimo, se preocupaba mas en como ir vestido que en guiar a los nuevos contratados. La paga, malisisma"
bad,I would not recommend a friend to work for Exxon cause management don't care about there employees and they are rude to the employees and to the public
bad,"Awful work culture, no work life balance. Horrible management style, they do not value you as a person, you are just a number."
bad,"Felt like just another number being assessed towards the bottom line here. My team was good, but management had no clue what they were doing and undercut folks efforts daily."
bad,"The job, regardless of title, is politics. The ""company"" chooses who they like, and they will get promoted. They will get the credit for whatever they can, regardless of who did the work."
bad,Management is terrible and the work environment is just as awful. I've experienced extreme prejudice since I've been working for this company. The amount of disrespect that is shown by the upper management is unreal.
bad,"the boss works around your schedule which is good. friendly coworkers and customers. job is okay. hours are decent but not enough, it was hard to get more. I got paid weekly which is always nice"
bad,"You don't learn much, and often left on your own to figure out how the job works. Advancement to an assistant manager only means doing all the dirty work for higher management and taking all the blame. There are no benefits if you plan on having a pay check, no over-time, and no pay raises unless you get a new position. Which doesn't mean much, it's only a 50 cent raise from cashier to management. Most enjoyable part of the job? Free soda and coffee, and that's only if you're store makes a certain amount of money. If you have a slow store, you pay for each refill. And don't plan on sitting down, there are no breaks."
bad,"They dont really work with you at all or help you get a set shift to work. Tons of drama with other co workers for no reason, need to get way better employees."
bad,Overall its not the best place to move up in the company. Even though you move up fast by working hard however the lack of compensation for the long hours is not worth it. You do meet some great people and thats about it.
bad,Employees have it great here but sadly there are mostly Contractors that are treated like a piece of machinery that is easily replaced. Regularly they see employees that get the perks but do less.
bad,"Working at Exxon is terrible. The pay is bad. They overwork their employees. Only few employees actually do their job right. We get no breaks or overtime. The boss doesn’t care if you are there every single day for every shift, he’s very shady anyways."
bad,"It was an average job, low pay under the table. Mostly had to work shifts by yourself under staffed. Store was in a bad part of town and was no security."
bad,"Slow pace, not enough training. They didn’t listen to workers need. It was a fast pace on weekends. Customers were in and out. No breaks were given. You take them when it’s slow, or you eat as you work."
bad,"Managent was somewhat okay"
bad,not mutch to say for working as cashier good start toget familiar with people and have confidence on yourself learn how to communicate listening to others.
bad,"Dealing with customers, understanding how to sell a product. Get to know the customer and thier needs.  Waking up early, ready for work. Made sure all my tasks were done properly. Team work was amazing. Taking notes and making sure that mistakes were not done."
bad,Good benefits but terrible Management.  Way to much red tape.  Very difficult to complete an easy task without having to get the permission of several managers who have no clue what the job entails.
bad,"I was overworked for the pay I was receiving. I left the company because I had to relocated due to personal commitments at the time, and I am glad of the occurrence."
bad,working at exxon would have been a better experience if i had a better manager at the time i was there the work was not hard but the manager made the enviroment stressful
bad,"While the pay may be great, you'll suffer in your personal life and mental state. The middle managers love putting people down. As a result, everyone's happiness is ground down to nothing. Management needs to learn how to be realistic and remember that their employees are individuals who want to grow and flourish, not just lackies to hang around all day fixing every problem with no money."
bad,"Great mix of projects, the environment was laid back. Family feel. Everyone got along with each other. I was challenged on a daily basis. Loved my time."
bad,Understaffed which caused lots of customer frustration towards employees. AC would routinely break every month for one to two days which made the inside of the box turn into an oven. Half the management was wonderful and the other absolutely despicable.
bad,"Handle gas station overnight in very busy Miami area.  Greeted customers, provided sales,assistance with directions, maintained inventory,  cleaned area and prepared report for next shift."
bad,"my day was typified by long hours, tiresome routines, strict work rules and a tough working environment."
bad,I got to meet new people each and every day. I got to learn how to go through the ordering process for product that the store needed each and every week.
bad,"The management was ill-equipped. There was no specific call in routine, I wasn't properly notified of schedule changes, and no benefits were offered in this position. There was no room to advance and raises were hardly ever approved."
bad,"I was just a regular"
bad,this was a job where the assistant manager would put down or get on employees while customers was around to hear. Very disrespectful and unprofessional
bad,"this position is just an interim job for me till i can find something better, i worked here before from 2009-2010, love my return customers, don't really like the nasty ones.."
bad,"Some coworkers were good, some not so much. Assistant managers were nice. Very gossipy though. I had a decent sized list of tasks per shift, so the day typically went rather quick. I didn't feel appreciated by the manager at all; the hardest part of this job was putting up with the bad treatment, despite the fact that I had worked as hard as the rest. The only redeeming quality of this job were the people I had met."
bad,"I liked working in this store I got to meet  different people everyday stocking shelves, an ordering , receiving waiting on the customers."
bad,"managers changed every few months. they had no idea what they were doing. buzzwords and presentations were important, not actual work"
bad,"Working at the exxon mobil i work at is oka i really enjoy my weekly pay but i much rather change careers because working here at first i knew i wanted to do great things and advance in the company and most likely to be become a great asset to this mobil company. But honestly i dont see the management doing that they rather have employee that half do things and im just not that type of person im a true believer if you are a hard working good things will pay off but the only thing im getting paid here is to work for a little of nothing while the worker that hardly do anything advance just because of the history the have with management so i want to find a career not just a job, and also a company that is going to respect my hard work and dedication."
bad,This job made me realize that I wanted to work in an office helping people
bad,easy and establishing good work training. cashier was a great job.
bad,"I was with this company for 10 years. The suck you in with great benefits, but you soon realize that they care only about the customer, at the employee's expense."
bad,"Meets new customer, satisfying customer needs, helping employees to get done the task that has to be done, Management not recognizing the hard work that has made, cutting off our salary and hours and no vacation was available for the whole year. hardest part of the job is giving all the best on your JOB but management does'nt care about the Employees all they want is just have the business to grow.."
bad,I enjoyed the front line sales to customers and finding ways to help each customer. My co-workers allowed me to rpmote a team enviroment and it improve sales.
bad,it was ok if you had the employees you needed to run the store but terrible when you didn't...high pressure from top.
bad,"This place for a work environment sucks... it’s slow at times the hrs are terrible, there’s no overtime, no benefits, no discounts nothin you get 9 an hr and that’s it.."
bad,It was a great place if you were single work life balance was terrible and they have a rule allowing them to force you to work a second straight 8hr shift.
bad,"XOM has many subsidiaries and each one of them has its own sub-culture.  Upstream seems to be more relaxed and better paid than downstream.  Corporate engineering function in downstream is very competitive and functions under a Good Ol’ Boy Network approach.  It’s not what you know but who you know for advancement and promotions.  Differences of rationalized opinions are often perceived as challenge to status quo, dismissed, and cause for punishment during performance reviews.  Culture is grounded on the use of catch phrases used by top managament and subsequently used by mid-level managers and the like.  Many mid level managers and leads are technically incompetent.  However, they play the game and are praised as valuable resources.  Too much burocracy, paper work, and useless check lists and initiatives.  The pay is great but at some point everything else starts to weigh in more.  If playing by someone elses rules, blindly following directions with no regard for understanding, this is the place for you."
bad,"Forced rankings and ill-equipped managers create a lack of trust. All employees work hard due to the ranking process, yet many lose motivation as they quickly fall in potential despite strong output."
bad,i was set up to be fired by scott because i didnt disclosed that i was pregnant when i got hired. he placed lotta tickets for me to sell never put them in the register i had to ring them as miscellaneous and i kept the slip to show proof. 85bucks worth of lotto tickets not registered so scott concluded i stole the money hee purposely didnt register those tickets.
bad,"The people that work at and manage Exxon/Mobile - 7/11 are good people, but unfortunately the management doesn't do well at keeping the balance of organizing and running a profitable store while treating and compensating its employees fairly. The result is high turnover, lack of agreed upon systems, and underperforming employees."
bad,Very good compensation and benefits. Culture is cut throat and competitive. Politics is critical to succeed  for all levels of the hierarchy. Backstabbing is a norm. Have not met a person who doesn't know the exact date they can retire with full pension.
bad,"If you want to see people outside of work, do not work here. Typically work 60-100 hour weeks as an operator. Make good money, but that's all."
bad,"The owner/manager had been stealing from the store, I didn't know until the other part owner closed it down and sold it. I would get home after working 9 hours straight and the owner would call me back in because he left and nobody new how to fix the problem when the computers/pumps went out."
bad,"there was good co worker, i like to work as cashier, and i like to give my costumer good service."
bad,"Typical day at work here includes standing behind a register for several hours per day, while managing cleaning tasks during customers."
bad,This is a temporary part-time job until I find full-time employment.
bad,good place to start with I was just came from Egypt working overnight
bad,"This is a very difficult place to work for, from corporate to field offices. They pay you good money while micromanaging you. Very inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. Supervisors make all the decisions regarding everything you do. The power is in their hands, if you are their ""pet"" you are golden; if not- your out. Upper management has a power struggle with emploees. You have professional degree employee's managed by non-degreed friends and relatives that have worked there for years."
bad,i had to take care of customers and keep the store clean. i really like talking and making jokes with the customers.
bad,Exxon Mobile was a pretty good company to work for in Houston.  Their managers were not the best and they treated contractors poorly.  I would not want to work for them to soon.
bad,"A minority has to be 2x more educated and 4x better at their job than their white counterparts. Racism, nepotism, and favoritism is the culture of the Louisiana plants."
bad,Itsa bad environment..bad attitudes..dont get sick..they get mad..think that you supposed yo work sick..if you call in they take everything personal..not professional at all
bad,"Safety first, unless you can make the company money or meet a deadline; then they look the other way while people perform policy violations that would get anybody else fired if seen. The company cares about lawsuit prevention and making money, nothing else. Don't let them fool you into thinking otherwise."
bad,"Worked for three contracts over a 4 year period with company. There was good and bad, but overall the heart ache, pain, and frustration they inflicted was not worth the trouble or time invested.  Ironically my 3rd stint with them had the highest title and lowest pay.  Worked with some good personnel, but the middle management is plagued with issues and a lack of responsibility.  The work and the people I got to know over the years was the best aspect."
bad,No work life balance.  Good company for the pay but not worth the stressful work atmosphere.  I am also not sure why you are having me review a job I had over 4 years ago.
bad,a day at work okay easy fast . it was mostly at night when I had drunk people come in try to steal or hit on me they would talk bad to me if I ignored them . but it wasn't always like that at night there some nights . & I did meet a lot people got feed a lot of food so it had its up & downs just like any other job
bad,The environment was in a very busy area which was known for being robbed. They would always schedule women to close at night instead of men. It was very scary working there.
bad,"Unfortunately I think the name Exxon is tainted by these kind of individually owned businesses.  The owner's do not respect person lives of these employees and they also do not show appreciate for them either.  I enjoy of ""Job"" just not the way things were preformed and/or handled."
bad,"IT has always been treated as just a cost.  With digital technology increasing in importance, the company is in a difficult spot.  They've hired mostly non-technical staff for IT for many years to save money.  Now they have a 6000+ person IT staff with very little true IT skill.  They've also got a mass of unskilled and scared management that's not sure what to do."
bad,"its a typical work place for a gas station, management manly hires female so it can be to much gossip and feel like high school, need to hire more diversity, assistant management doesn't know how to really mange and can put her personal life to work,"
bad,"The place has little structure, little in management or rules. One sick day meant you were fired, and then hired the very next day when they wanted you back in. Suspected of illegal activities."
bad,"As a former Mobil employee, the bringing together of two diametrically opposed cultures to form XOM was a challenge.  The benefits are as good as any company bar none.  However, you'll have to have the right personality to fit into a rigid XOM corporate culture."
bad,"•	Preformed custodial duties as needed"
bad,I liked the frred om of working 3rd shift. It helped me learn how to work little or no supervision.
bad,"A typical day at Exxon was a blessing with the right management. Beginning with stocking items for customer satisfaction. Then maintance of store and cooler area. After all is done, the customer service takes place; where you meet and greet different people from different places in the world. This was my enjoyment of being employed at Exxon, meeting new people and learning from them."
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the public
bad,Not a bad company to work for if they would pay according to your work. Your elected to work holidays without receiving holiday pay. Huge risk for robberies
bad,The manager did not speak English.  Very hard to communicate . They would not let us cash or deposit our checks when we got them. Sometimes the checks bounced.
bad,"The day shift was just one person, so I was always busy.  The work was very physical, and injuries are common.  But I enjoyed interacting with the customers and the crew."
bad,"ExxonMobil in general is a good company, what makes the company great are its people. And sometimes these people who was on top of their position who doesn't deserved will also destroy the company. In Middle East where ExxonMobil operates still has a very strong discrimination which does not provide equal opportunity or not able to recognized the value of its people."
bad,"Can provide you with good experience if you are working for the right managers but the continual rotation from position to position every 2 years leads to very few experts who are then looked down on by people that know less that they do. As the experienced expertize moves on there will be a massive vacuum of real engineers to run the show.  The force ranking system defeats the purpose of developing good professional people, just relies on uninformed remote managers that have no idea what you are really doing when you are working internationally and then they rank you against other employees that they talk to every day in the home office. Not a good system.."
bad,Not a bad place to work at but after awhile things got bad due to upper management. I loved my manager but upper was not pleasant. Place was old and dirty no matter how hard you cleaned
bad,"Light work, mostly cleaning and customer service. There are a few extra computer operations needed here than yoyr normal gas station becayse it is also a truck stop."
bad,No room for advancements but I worked at a private owned store.It was a very small town and if the owners daughter didn't like you she made it rough. I also caught them taking money out of my check. Not cool.
bad,sort-of an okay place to work. difficulty was the necessity to justify it's own existence as being worth its cost to the operating companies. I personally had trouble dealing with inexperienced middle managers put into position of authority before they were ready but that was the demographics at the time. more training for new supervisors may have helped but their (new supervisors) emphasis was on process as opposed to people.
bad,"Life as a contractor at Exxon is interesting. There is an obvious disdain towards them and everyone openly discusses how contractors can be cut at any time. "
bad,"Company relies only on placing people in different client places."
bad,"I was working for some income while I studied for my securities and life and health ins. licences to work for Prudential.  I absolutely LOVE working with the public at a fast paced gas station. Obviously pay wasn't going to work, but FUN job...FUN FUN FUN"
bad,Life of a contractor at Exxon is short lived as there's no future or career path. You're only as good as the number of tickets you put in. The employees that work there are very nice and the campus is AMAZING. Big brother is always watching and you will lose your job if you simply speed in the campus. Zero tolerance. You will also not get a raise as contracts are only for a year.
bad,"Wonderful company to work for.  Excellent benefits, great retirement.  Excellent vacation & sick time.  Great group of people to work with."
bad,Es una  industria totalmente distinta al resto. Me permitió conocer acerca del negocio. Sin embargo es una empresa orientada exclusivamente al control contable y poco flexible al análisis de procesos y cambios.
bad,"Men heeft ooit gezegd toen ik er kwam werken dat ik in een goede kooi zat, zeer veel verdienen maar verder je mond houden. "
bad,Tout le monde à peur de perdre sa place donc pas de confiance. Traité comme un chien et ça a perdu beaucoup au niveau prime et salaire
bad,"I would not recommend working here for anyone. It is not fun, not likable. Pay was not adequate, hours were not fair. Manager was rude, overbearing, and had an attitude. Co-workers, however, were wonderful to work with."
bad,"Management could be cleaned up a bit, need more employees, very dusty, could use a better cleaning method, overall relaxed phone use, choice of sitting. Great hours."
bad,Before management changed everything was ok. Worked over night so it was slow paced. Friendly customers but the area at the time I worked was not a good location
bad,Good job if you need the money but get outta there quick not really any room for advancement. Ohh i forgot to mention there are no benefits. So good luck
bad,"Good benefits, but not appreciated as person. Good ole boy culture can be exclusive and hostile. Field assignments may be detrimental if  detached from corporate network."
bad,"Lots of public interaction;  all types of dispositions.  Manager's attitude was unpredictable from day to day, depending on if the Regional Manager was on site."
bad,It was a okay job and most people never stayed as long as I did. You deal with hookers and drunks all night it was not the greatest job out there yep.
bad,"•	Maintained high-performance staff. Recruited and hired employees observing state and federal laws, including ADA compliance. Conducted onboarding and training, and coaching to motivate performance."
bad,"A typical day was, making coffee, counting merchandise, keeping store and parking lot clean and organized. I loved having a lot of regular customers, made a lot of new friends."
bad,"ExxonMobil is a world all it's own and definitely isn't the place for everyone, however it can be very enlightening, challenging, and several other things."
bad,I'm thankful for the opportunity because I was homeless when I got the job here and it got me off the street eventually but they didn't want to give full time and if they did it was like the minimum like 32 hours a week.
bad,Not enough hours and the pay was not that good the management was extremely friendly and would actually work with you schedule
bad,"controllo inserimento  materiali in ingresso del giorno prima da parte dell'ufficio ricezione, controllo delle uscite di produzione e verifica dello stock a  magazzino.

bad,Fun place to work . I interact with customers on a daily basis.  i enjoyed putting a smile on people face and holding conversations.
bad,"Great place to work for, great team, organized staff. I would recommend this job to any one who is thinking of working here."
bad,"turning on pumps"
bad,I would say to make sure that you really know the business before going into being a cashier at a convenience store.
bad,"long, boring how to deal with been there and relief don't show up.And also the hardest part after being there for 10 hrs. standing in one place."
bad,Mala organización de trabajo por parte de los managers
bad,"Open store, great customers, selling gas, food items and lottery tickets, ordered supplies.  I worked alone. The hardest part of the  job was to keep hotdogs and other foods refreshed when low because of customers in store.  Being able to chat with my customers when not busy"
bad,"While XOM pays an above average money for the work, its is ALL about the bottom line. Family is a secondary priority and the ""good OL boy"" system is hard at work, as most employees are second or third generation exxon. "
bad,"I Have learned to give people full attention , and answer with yes or no ma'am or sir. look at someone in eye when communicating"
bad,"This is a company that felt very much stuck in it's ways. As an independent thinker that values the space to upper creative solutions, my growth was stunted."
bad,"Working in such an reputable establishment was a great one because l was able to gain job experience and l also develop my skills on work process in oil and gas companies as reflexted in my CV. ln the process l acquire adequate training which is very useful on my day to day activities, the management also emphasis on safety development of personnel in all ramification and how co-workers coperate to achieved success in every jobs. The hardest part of the job was the risk involved in flying offshores for that number of years and the enjoyment part was the job experience which help me in my future carrieer."
good,As I was working at this location I started to notice management was a huge issue. The hardest part was dealing with my manager who was not nice to me at all.
good,"What I have learned working here is just how important team work really is, if co-workers are not on the same page then the work becomes horrendous and unending. "
good,"Good environment "
good,Mangers played favorites and never had a set schedule and always have to be avaibled for a call in. Had to finish work that was not completed by the shift before mine.
good,This job is very stressful at times. It's often times not worth the hassle. My management was very poor and the pay was horrible.
good,I appreciate the experience to run a store wish there was more opportunities or not privately owned.
good,"I was ""let go"" but I don't hold a grudge, it was my fault and if I could work there again, I would. I enjoyed the atmosphere and repeated customers that I was able to build friendships with."
good,I was manager at a gas station. I managed 4 other employees under me. The owner was easy to communicate with and to work for. There was no room for advancement. No insurance or incentives.
good,"I worked there for years as a cashier, hours were long & the money wasn’t worth the work. They weren’t family  ordinate  & were very strict.  Overall I would not want to work there again."
good,Over worked and I still enjoyed my job.no benefits and I had no outside life from my job. It all depends on  who  the operator is . I loved staying busy and enjoyed the customers whom came inside. I had no management above me who was able to help much so I learned alot of the business myself. I enjoyed and respected my boss but he was unable to be there at all for my time there.
good,"Not the best place to work if you were looking for a raise. Busy environment. They liked to keep us busy and working all the time, which is good it made the days pass by faster."
good,"8 hours stand, not a minute to rest. Eat while standing, do three people work by yourself... Perfect for machines."
good,"It was a gas station job, you basically took care of the customers needs. Cleaned the store, accepted payments and returned change to customers. The job requires employees that are willing to work any shift including nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,"My typical day working for Mobil would start by taking inventory counts and counting out my cash register to make sure there weren't any discrepancies between paperwork. I would stock merchandise, cash out customers, authorize gas pumps, answer phones, manage mechanic appointments, clean and maintain the inside of the store, along with the property. I made inventory orders for product and also received orders. I dealt with customer complaints and made the schedules for the rest of my team members. "
good,"My typical day at work is non stop from the time you get there until you leave from cashier, cleaning the store, facing the store, and unloading truck. I learned that the gas station life is totally different job then what I am used to. I get along with my all my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is moving all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,The hardest part of my job is the employer cutting hours for those who work hard and giving hours to those who slack. They do not give you a chance to move up to another position or learn a new job.
good,"There wasn't any place to move up in promotion.  I was able to do books, and manager duties, but not paid for it.  Working for Exxon was a great experience because I worked at 5 of them that the owner owned."
good,"cash drops, cash register operation, scan merchandise to register PC, mop floor , wipe down doors, clean restrooms, stock merchandise if needed, maintain a clean store,"
good,"You are constantly busy. There is a lot of inventory involved. Usually only one person per shift and it can get overwhelming. I got robbed at knifepoint while working here and was told by the owners to get over it, it was their money that was stolen. And had to sign a release form saying I didn't want them to pay for me to go to therapy to deal with the robbery before I was allowed to go back to work."
good,"Typical cashier job, handling money and lottery purchases. Dealing with rude and nasty customers. Having to clean the entire store and filthy bathrooms. Working alone and he having to keep your eyes in the customer's and your area."
good,"Won't go back ever and won't refer any"
good,"I really enjoyed working where I did. I enjoyed the customers and my employees. My manager didn’t view them as humans and treated all of us ‘below’ her. Upper management is good, considering what they have to work with. The reason I quit: I was promised advancement opportunities, but my manager would never give a blessing, she was too power hungry, called us cry babies amongst other names and was overall, a terrible manager."
good,When I first started to work there my manager was great. Than about 8 months after I was there she started to talked about ppl behind there back and smile in their face. (She is fake) she quit about 9 months after I started. Than we had no manager and only 2 employees which was me and another coworker which had been there for about 1 year so me and her worked alot of hours. I opened and she closed the store yes very stressful but we did it until the dm hired 2 ppl. Well they hired a manager which didn't know anything she had no experience for managment she even told us. So she quit within 2 weeks because she missed 3 days in a row and called out on the 4th day and she was told not to come back if she did not come to work that day. Because manager are salary paid. So than we was manager less again well me and my coworker that had been there for over 1 year and a half thought the dm would of came to one of us and see if we would step up and be the manager.  Well they didn't and one of the new girls that was there 2 weeks went and asked them and she got the position. Remind you she is 22 and has no manager experience.  And me and my other co worker worked for this company for over a year and when no one was there to work me and her ran the store by ourself so the store didn't have to shut the doors. So to me that is wrong and I still make what I was hired at I have not gotten a raise and neither has my coworker.  They dont care about there employees at all. If they did me and my coworker would of been told we appreciate everything you are doing and we are thankful. But nope nothing
good,Over all working there was a great experience getting to know that every day customers that come in serving all the customers but management was poor   If she didn’t like what you done she tried to take everything out on you  she would order some of the craziest stuff no one would buy because it was too high priced
good,Lack of advancement opportunities to those who really show the desire. Was in a very public facing role and questioned the ethics of what my manager wanted me to do ...took them 4 years to work the process of firing me
good,They were poorly ran due to management. Nothing was done about people not coming to work i didn't receive the pay for third shift. Vary unsanitary place to work
good,One the company sold the buisness the new owners ran it in the ground ...took out everything the customers liked and eventually it closed due to poor buisness management
good,"There are numerous complete breakdowns between the contractors and employees. No one communications until it is too late. Discovery of excessive spending, first aids, security etc."
good,This is probably the worst job I've had. Tr hours were horribles. I never got a set schedule like I was promised. I was hired in as an assistant manager but never even started training for he position and I was there for three months
good,"The job itself is not bad. Very easy, good customers. But the management is awful, at least at the location where I was employed. She had no people skills. She treated her employees poorly and talked to customers inappropriately. That is why I left."
good,It was a nice job I handled the register the deli and the customer. I cleaned the gas pumps. I had to stock the coolers and the products. I hand to handle safe drops also
good,Very good exposure for being working in the refiner for the last 9 years as a contractor they don't hire in IT so decided to move on to full time position.
good,"This company was as predictable as any other, under paid and over worked. Staff and management was OK, work load was simple."
good,"i would clock in "
good,"i enjoy the people that come in, but working the 3rd shift by myself was every unsafe to me. manager wanted to put all of the responsibilities off on other people."
good,"Safety is priority. Daily KPI standards that required to be action-ed daily.  "
good,"Interacting with several customers daily and responsible for the monies and accounting of the gas station."
good,"Fun experience assisting and helping customers, however moving up in the company is something else."
good,"on the days I worked behind the register I would come in about an hour before the other person left to take trash out and to stock cooler and any other item that was low. Then we would do shift change and I was usually by myself. We closed at midnight which was the end of my shift, lock up and go home. Since I did work alone often, I would have to make quick decisions based on the stores benifiets. My management wasnt rarely around because he owned other stores out of town and also lived near them. I loved my co-workers we all got along and they always worked hard. Sometimes there would be a few unlikeable customers that would throw a fit about prices or having to wait in line. But other than that it was fairly easy to make everyother customer happy. The best part was when all 3 of us would work together even the regulars liked it. They were such a fun group of girls, not a dull moment"
good,The managers dont listen to their employees. I learned that the corporate managers dont hire upper managers from within employees that are already there. Co-workers are not responsible and are lazy. The hardest part of the job is working long hours without any help. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers !
good,I worked in the mailroom. Pay was terrible and so were benefits. I enjoyed my coworkers but my manager was bipolar and you never knew how the day was going to be
good,Management is horrible no room to grow and low pay. They make a lot of promises that were never kept and blame is thrown on whoever for any circumstances.
good,"This Job is a great place to work. however, i didn't get too much of a welcoming feeling. Also in training they treat you like a kid instead of showing you what to do. & employees talk too much about their personal reasons. & the manager shows seniority to the people who's been working for years or months.  But besides that its a great job."
good,"Pay was adequate but difficult to receive raise or career advancement even if advancement was offered.Scheduling was flexible, but management would often change schedule and or hold associates hostage to work sporadic shifts if other associates were late or no-shows. Overall, unorganized management with adequate pay."
good,"A typical day is greeting the customers and stocking,cleaning,assisting the customer in their needs. Supporting management with the agenda for the day. keeping customers at ease and happy, while performing loss prevention duties. Keeping everything up to its capacity when the store is busy. When things are slow and you get to converse with the customers."
good,"Nice and friendly environment"
good,Working at Mobil was a good experience. The customers were pleasant. It was my job to provide excellent customer service. Management was o.k. My attendance was great.
good,"Once an employee clocks in, it is important to count the inventory and money in the register to relieve a person on shift. When all the necessary items are logged, you can then handle all purchases/transaction within Exxon. The management treats me well and listen to my concerns. The work culture is different from what I expected originally. The other employees are nice, friendly, and trained me really well. The hardest part of the job is memorizing many functions of the register. It becomes easier with practice. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with different customers throughout the shift."
good,"The exceptional quality of our workforce provides a valuable competitive edge. To build on this advantage, we will strive to hire and retain the most qualified people available and to maximize their opportunities for success through training and development. We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment enriched by diversity and characterized by open communication, trust, and fair treatment."
good,"Working there was great when there were enough people scheduled to take on a shift. There are no benefits and hours are competitive. Tips were better in the morning than the night. "
good,It was okay for a job i needed to have. But i wouldn't go back. However i do stop by there from time to time to purchase petroleum at this location. The only real deterrent was the weather
good,Not the best job at times it was so boring and management was horrible which is the reason I left the job not my choice of job anymore good luck to this who choose
good,I worked here strictly on contract. The job itself was great but that's it. The pay was pitiful. The benefits were pitiful. Management was nonexistent. Vacation/Time off was a joke.
good,Short time contracted job that paid very well but was a inconvenience due to traveling to job was given the right tools to do job only complaint I had was management
good,I was constantly threatened by patrons.  The location was in a bad area.  The manager was unappreciative.  The other people I worked with were not reliable.
good,"In exxon gas station I have a two year customer service experience such as greet, ascertain, help locate items etc. Security for the stocked items from theft and cleaning the store."
good,The Manger and the boss both made the environment uncomfortable to work in. I was not getting proper training like I was told. They are very lazy and also rude to the new employees. The boss was always trying to get me to do things I didn't agree upon. So I had chose to quite because it was not the state of work I had sign up for.
good,"Pros - It's a great place to start to gain experience in the working world.  The job is easy to learn and very repetitive.  The customers are often regulars and become great friends."
good,Some of the employers need to work on their communicates infront of the customers .but all in all i enojoyd working there they just need to update there systems
good,As being a overnight clerk/cashier it was scary. The only security that you have is the police and they do have a job to do. I do believe they should have at least 2 employees that work overnight ....
good,"Typically you will go in to the store you would work at either as a stocking associate or as a register operator. Sometimes you will do both in between customers. The store I am currently with has a two person crew. You will spend a lot of time in a cold cooler stocking drinks, cleaning, organizing, and assisting customers. If you aren't a smoker you will learn tobacco as if you were, the same applies to the lottery. I have been very lucky to have co-workers I am compatible with. The hardest part is the pressure and expectations of the management crew while the most enjoyable part are some of the customers who come in and share their humorous side."
good,"There was always something to do. Rather it was to help customers find something or cleaning.I learned how to use p.o.s system as a cash register. The management was not that great, but the my coworkers always had a new story that they wanted to talk about."
good,I worked my tail of for these people and they stabbed me in the back with promises of a better future with raises and advancements...
good,Responsible for taking care of customers who visited the store. A very stressful place to work because of rude customers. This was a part time job.
good,"Very nice manager however he did not participate or observe the division of the workload or the ongoing problems within his department. I was hired to replace someone that left for the exact reason that I did, extremely unpleasant and unethical co-worker."
good,"It was a great job, but if you want advancement do not expect this."
good,It was wonderful meeting different types of people and being able to help them. Unfortunately there was no room to grow in this company. So I found something that would allow me to do that
good,Only worked here while I was in school. I wouldn’t work here again. It might be different in other places but here it was one person all afternoon and when 5pm hit the line was out the door and no one was there to help.
good,"Great work place very fast pace, Have met a variety of people from all over the world. You do deal with some rude people. It has its good moments and bad."
good,"Pay is not very good but good work environment. No overtime pay. No advancement for as moving up no matter what education you have, no benefits availed."
good,"agréable entreprise, j'avais une mission pour 6 mois"
good,This would be a Nice job for a high school student but not for someone who has bills and a lifestyle to maintain the pay weekly Just is not enough to live on
good,"Entrar en exxon es como volver en el tiempo a los 50s....si sos de tecnología, alejate en cuanto puedas, a menos que lo tuyo sea más hacer la plancha y llevarte bien políticamente con los 'líderes' eventuales..."
good,"Scheduled to work 4 on 4 off, rotating shift.  Most 4 off you're required to work at least two of those days.  Very fast paced work environment, nights covered three posts versus one on days."
good,Liked the work setting. Just didnt like how the bosses ran the business. Too much drama there. Need to be a little more professional with their workers and how they run things. Not saying all Exxons are like that.
good,Fun Place Nice People Competitive Opportunity To Progress & Become A Shift Leader Good Workers Helps Customers But We Do Not Have A Employee Discount Or Employee Meals
good,Always keep busy. Subway located in store. Discount coffee and Subway. Friendly regular customers. Time and a half pay for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,Learning the job is easy. Working at a gas station is great if you live near it. The computer system is user friendly. You will have to do things like cleaning and stocking in addition to working the register.
good,"Only good as a temporary job while you look for something better. very low hourly pay. inconsistent hours. no paid time off, no benefits. you have to find your own replacement if you need a unpaid timeoff."
good,"In a small town there isnt much to do, so everyone comes to the gas station. That in its self can be a good or bad thing because in this case the store was too small and we constantly got overrun with too many customers and only two employees to prepare cook and serve food while also cashing out people and taking care of gas spills or other messes inside of the store. i just feel like they expected a little bit too much for what they were trying to pay us. in the end it was an alright place to work, personally wouldn't recommend to anyone though."
good,"All in all, a typical day at work me went well. Work days consisted of cashing out customers, stocking coolers, and cleaning the store, and restroom areas, also along with taking any trash out the designated areas."
good,No advancement opportunities not many benefits offered I practically ran the store on my shift because you work alone which is find in the daytime but night shifts​ are dangerous to work in a convenience store alone. You get another $.50 more than minimum wage.
good,It was mostly an easy do some times were busy. I had to get out of my shy habits. co workers were often late and they would short my hours on my check all the time. Hardest part was when drunk people would come in or a customer was just rude and insulting. I liked being on shift alone. Manager want above and beyond her job.
good,"The compensation and benefits are almost unbeatable. However, the work to life balance is very ones sided. You are required to work many hours of overtime on nights and weekends without advanced notice."
good,The pay is above the industry average but the lack of a work/life balance really turns the tables.  The management is incompetent and does not provide a clear direction on whether you are performing well or not.
good,"learned how to use the lottery machine "
good,"Typical  day was great and I learned new admin processes and management was great along with coworkers.  Overall, the job was great"
good,"overall it was a good place to work, I worked alone, the hardest part  was if I had any problems I had to figure it out alone with no experience which taught me to fix problems on my own"
good,This is a good place to start if you are new in your field. People who I worked with were reasonable and flexible.
good,"Exxonmobil, ""the corporate giant"", is a great place to wok if all your concerned about is making money. They don't care any more about you that anyone else or your family. "
good,"mon travail actuel me permet d’être totalement autonome pour tous ce qui concerne la gestion de mon emploi, ayant un poste de serrurier qui a pour avantage une trés grande diversité d'intervention"
good,"I had several people take off and not pay for the gas. The ladies I worked with where rude and it was easy to cook and run the register,"
good,"okay place to work, management does not back its employees, easy job, but not a very good team work envirment. the hardest part of the job was not being able to believe the management"
good,Not a very professional place hours are very low and management is lacking advancement  management are not up to par and employees do most of the work overall very poor place to work
good,"It was dealing with people addicted to drug, panhandlers, I was propositioned to do adult videos and they were trying to get to leave with them (sex traffickers). Other then that everyone else was nice and easy to talk to."
good,did not get along with the district manager and he left right after i did. Simple math was not a strong point at all with him..I worked sometimes every night shift 7 days a week for a few months before they found new people to wok there.. Heaven forbid i got a day off in that time
good,"My job is ok i mean it is very easy to do, i cash out customers and make sure that my area is clean before i leave. Depending on the days i put orders into system."
good,Didn't get consistent scheduling. Did not receive one shift. worked  back-to-back  Shifts ...close to open that is not something that I agree with. No personal reguard
good,good company to work for not much room for advancement there is not really much i would like to say. i enjoyed my time there and the people. there is not room for advancement
good,I  worked as Tableau specialist as contractor in exxon-Mobil. My experience when comes to learning agile was great but the Worst thing was the team members.
good,Inner Circle and no possibilities for Growth . The company is great but there is no way you can get promotions because of the good all boy system. There seems to be many people whose opinions matter more than the quality of their work. People who are ready to retire dont seem to care
good,At the store i provide a hard work ethic. I rarely show up late and never call out from work. I give it my all to make sure thr store is well taken care of.
good,"its a job , scary being female working night shift but it pays the bills , not allowed to sit down at all making it hard for people with health problems to work there , but it pays the bills ."
good,"Working at Exonmobil is a nice part time job to start with but as someone gets older, its harder to live on the pay.  There are flexible hours which is very helpful but there is not overtime included so it is hard to work full time."
good,The job itself was fine. My manager was a paranoid control freak that thought everyone was out to get him. He made coming to work dreadful. Plus the pay and benefits were low due to it being a contract position. It was a good job for that period of my life
good,"My boss was fantastic, the costumers were all kind, some of the workers were rude to costumers and other coworkers. Any issues that the rude coworkers caused were handled swiftly by management."
good,"Great provider for a family and great benefits. However, not much time away from work, constant call outs and not reimbursed for additional days worked."
good,The company was not organized and was hard to reach supervisors when issues came up especially during second and third shift.  There constant issues with the gas pumps not working properly.
good,I had my own discrepancies with my boss but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed working there and I would again just not at that particular location.
good,"Average  convenience  store experience.  Cashier duties, some cleaning, removal of trash. Absolutely no  paid time off or sick days. Sometimes  able to switch days with other employees to accommodate needed days off."
good,"This is a well paying company however the job was not good on family and lifestyle of a family oriented individual."
good,i worked long hours with no breaks. Best part was  I loved my regulars. I had a bad management team. the hardest part of my job was dealing with nasty customers.
good,"Poor security on money and items "
good,Safety is priority #1. Workplace culture is conservative and middle management doesn't seem to go to bat for their underlings.  Compensation and benefits are good but not impressive anymore.
good,Loved working with internal and external customers.  Company provides a work/life balance and recognized hard work.  Days when rewarded with extended lunch
good,"I didn't like the job at most,due to scheduled conflict with school hours,my manager wasn't willing to work with me around her scheduled,great benefit though,friendly enviorment/work place,love meeting new faces,enjoyed working with mycoworkers while it last."
good,"Running the cash register,cooking, cleaning and stocking shelves. Was a fast paced, some people you meet some really nice customers. I enjoy working with people."
good,"A typical work day was very calm, I learned different technique's and how to use different systems. the management where cool people to work with respectful. the work place culture was little had to get use to at times. The hardest part of the job was leaving and finding work after being robbed at gun point there. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"It was a decent place to work that offered benefits. Met some famous people that came through the area and stopped by to fuel up, use the restroom, and buy food and drinks."
good,"This is unnecessary to provide. It was through a temp agency.  I was satisfied working there, the position was terminated and the company managed the admin duties from their home office in Texas."
good,"running register ,paper work , cleaning ,stocking ,and dealing with public...  Exxon is a good company just wish they would appreciate more"
good,Being a gas attendant is incredibly easy and simple but the pay is the bare minimum and the gas fumes make you feel sick which is the worst part of the job. U will never get a raise or promotion and co-workers are usually foreign and speak little English. Nice part is you get to be out side and you have a lot of down time. Management will usually be Indian and all the supervisors will be members of his family. Don't recommend as anything but an in between opportunities type job.
good,Was fun working with the general public. I was responsible for ensuring the safety was up to standard monthly and conducted safety meetings.
good,"Providing first level support to customer sites, managing monthly reports and invoicing in Excel for all US locations. Responsible for ensuring accuracy between vendor invoices and the company database."
good,Was a good company but upper management not that great. Always had threats from upper management. Never had proper staffing. Worked 60 to 80 hours a week to cover bad staffing. Was not allowed overtime
good,Team Handling and Development for whole area and my job title is Area Sales Manager
good,good job until new management change what worked for everbody.
good,"Management is sub-par - they elevate people to management positions who have zero emotional intelligence, absolutely no leadership skills, and do not care about managing people or developing those in the early stages of their career."
good,If you love the oil & gas field then I would have to say Exxonmobil is the place to be. This company def has to work on the moral of the people and needs to adjust to the times and technology updates of this generation.
good,"I just go to say that when i was there the first 1 year and half everything was good, but the minute i got promoted things went down hill, employees could not deal with the fact that i was there assistant manager they could not stand it. so they make sure they make my work a living nightmare. Now I have a store where I don't have to deal with that kind of abuse."
good,This job gave me a new experiance to migrate with other people and learn about how people feel throughout the day. That allowed me to change my moods to help people feel better if their angry or just giving them the respect and good customer service!
good,"No benefits or raises, no payed holidays. "
good,Good benefits. a typical day at work. what you learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"learned a lot of things, experience great things during work, love learning the skills, obtain great skills , safety is very good, training is very fun"
good,Was always interesting something new every night .willing to work long shifts even overnight. Would always put my all into doing the work correctly and effectively..
good,I enjoyed working there because I gained more experience in many ways.i loved meeting new people and gaining a bond with them. The company isn’t the problem I think it’s about who you work for how things are ran.
good,Excellent managers. Easy job. Can get extremely busy at times. A lot of information to process at first but they work with you. Co-workers were good. Poor security. Emergency door openers on freezers did not work. Fast paced. Always something to do.
good,Hourly and salary employees have two completely different work experiences particularly with respect to benefits and potential growth prospects. It's almost comparable to working for two different companies.
good,I have recommended this position to other individuals. Overall I have enjoyed my time spent working for Exxon Mobile and consider it efficient and well managed company.
good,"ExxonMobil pays extremely well, but they demand far more from employees than the norm. You're essentially on call 24/7, due to the global makeup of employees."
good,Liked the job but overall supervision was poor. Expectations were not shared in a manner that allowed for full understanding of expected results. No mentoring to learn experiment procedures.
good,"You learn a lot, and the job is very demanding. On average, expect to work 60-100 hour weeks and vacations to get cancelled. Your time off is management's gambling chip. The pay is really good, and unless they sell the site you work at to another company, the retirement is very good as well. If they do sell your site, they treat you as if you were terminated, including the downgrade of your retirement. Expect to work all holidays."
good,They make job fun without them it was boring never the same people or atmosphere slow paced to fast paced in minutes lots of cleaning and stocking to do
good,some days are slow. others are fast pace. its pretty ok. theirs a lot of free time to myself most days. other days are so fast i can hardly think. its good for a first job to get experience and to learn how to deal with people.
good,"Pay is very good."
good,Very exhausting work especially when scheduled alone. Often times to much was expected for one individual to be able to complete during their shift all while running the register and assisting customers.
good,"I loved working there and meeting new people and serving customers with the best customer service. The company was great, to work for. Just wish they had health benefits and it was full time job."
good,"The ranking system is the worst in this company.  If the company is doing good, ranking does not matter. Otherwise, they use it to lay off people.  The company cares about the managers and not about regular employees."
good,"The rough area a lot of stress, not enough salary long hours but good co-workers very helping management is alright and on the day that's my choice so no complaints."
good,"The environment is pretty stressful and they're easy going about work-life balance. They're super obsessed with safety and it can get a little annoying because they go a bit overboard. However, there is a lot of work to do and although meticulous it was a good company to work for"
good,The job wasn't very hard just very demanding the mangers were nice just not very flexible with school and there were no benefits or room for advancement.
good,Managament could b better and better commuation. Other than that it was a good place to work for and coworkers where very friendly. Very nice customers coming in daily
good,I love working with people at the same time i was working i was going to school so this help with bills. i loved meeting different people everyday i just didn't like management they was not pleasing to people.
good,I am very neutral about this employer as a company. When I worked there the store manager was very uninvolved. the reason why I quit was because my concerns were never addressed and felt very unappreciated.
good,"Fast paced, high volume of folks year round. Great pay and benefits. Lots of contunious cleaning and stocking. Can be fun but not rewarding.  Strict guideline"
good,"If you need stable job you can rely on them. Need to multi task, sometimes you have to do all the work by yourself.Can be a high stress and very competitive environment. Not enough or significant raises. Everyone wants to be a manager but organizations are rather flat. Travel opportunities often limited."
good,Ability to participate in the lab environment and in writing papers and patents work.  Company has a large campus.  Company provided guidance in workday.
good,Nice place to work but it needs an upgrade . I liked the free soda . The manger was sweet..Barely saw her though. They could've had better security. I think I should've received a higher wage based on security issues at the time I was employed.
good,"handled the register, janitorial work, dealt with too many customers angry about the price of gas and acting like I had the power to change it."
good,"A typical work day at Exxon was not always a good one. Sometimes managers had nasty attitudes, and the owners were not better. I had to keep my composure plenty of times because of the disrespect and rudeness that came from managers."
good,"I work at a busier unit as opposed to some calmer, less stressful units so maybe my review is biased in some ways. The retirement and pay is good at Exxonmobil, but there are other plants that pay more. I often feel that management sides with the company policies, even when situations dictate that other alternatives are better not only for the worker but the company as well. "
good,First time I worked in an interesting environment but where i really learned a lot about working in a fast paced environment as well customer service was always key
good,"Great Company and salary but some supervisors require longer hours with submitting time in line of expenses. "
good,"my daily activities at work is getting my task done for my company,hardest part is keeping my tummy full lol, but there is nothing hard about a job you know you will enjoy,the most enjoyable part is knowing you help someone and you did the job properly"
good,"A typical day at work had its up and downs , days sales are amazing , and happy about achieving goals and more money , sometimes a lot of work needs to get done , and sales are low. But I am a hard worker , and I like to be positive at work at all times."
good,"It was fun to work there with the people and customers until the take over of newer owners. they were professional but didn't seem to like that other people had lives. I was injured at work there and they refused workmans compensation due to ""they didn't see it so it didn't happen"". I loved interacting and helping customers. Co-worker was great and I miss her. Learned how to be a team and work together. learned lottery and register. Hardest part of the job was when I was told I was going to only be working outside then was never permanently placed out there. Grant it, changes and adaptability are key in a company but don't keep saying it and not do so."
good,"cashier , stock, co-worker was nice part time work running daily work of gas station"
good,Great place to work while looking for another career. Fast pace a times.
good,I prefer not to give a review as this may be published and fellow coworkers or managers may read this and it could be used for purposes not beneficial to my career.
good,Daily we would go in and count our drawer and then begin work. It was a great environment with meeting new people daily. They also work with you with what you need off.
good,"XOM is highly regarded as one of the successful oil and gas company. Their international scale are amazing. However, due to the huge family of XOM, some local places don't get the equal benefits with other. "
good,My work environment is good on the co-worker level. I enjoy the people I work directly with. The job is different from day to day.The management level is a different case.They are often distant and not very personal at all.
good,This was a great job for me to make some cash in the summer while on break from college. Would have loved to keep it but it conflicted with my work schedule
good,"temp. job no advancement . low pay. seasonal cashier, unstable"
good,"Management was very bad, reason being the manager was very specific of the things that she allowed and refused to allow; meanwhile she does them herself. She is impatient and has a very ill tempered manner of handling business."
good,I enjoyed being able to meet all different people and they kept coming back and I always knew what they wanted. I enjoy customer service
good,"The typical day was filled with request in regards to users accounts and access that needed to be provided. They don't provide anything more than the initial training of the environment. Access on the network is limited. It reminds me of the old adage ""Don't let you right hand know what the left hand is doing."" Management was very tight. Working conditions weren't that great as far as space and climate. Learning nothing more than the environment. I studied on my own time to perfect my skill set."
good,"Very political, good ol' boy network despite all the pretty words. Hard to progress unless you happen to be amongst the favorites or have someone in your corner. For example, job openings are ONLY provided to managers, who then decide whether or not to nominate you for an opening...what a great way to hinder and cap career progression, not to mention legitimately discriminate against women and minorities. Additionally, once you come in as an admin, it is extremely rare to EVER progress into other professional roles, even after achieving a graduate degree. Don't come in as an admin with that ambition, you will be sorely disillusioned. Culture is amazingly cultlike - folks jokingly say oil runs in their veins. They go so far as to put XOM (in house abbreviation of ExxonMobil) on their license plates. They eat, sleep, and breathe this company, yet constantly espouse work/life balance. That's all semantics, as every executive or high level manager has an implied expectation to monitor and stay on top of emails and voicemails, even while sick or on vacation. Depends on the position level and salary as to whether you will get an accurate representation of life here. Higher paid employees generally view the company as a golden citadel of corporate heaven whereas lower paid folks will tell you quite a different tale. Definite socioeconmic class divisions within the company. Lower staff roles such as mailroom, janitors, cafeteria workers are treated as lesser individuals and often subject to disdain and rude behavior. I sympathize with them, and strive to treat them with dignity and"
good,"It was a good job, relaxed environment and good people to work with. This was a temporary position and lasted longer than expected."
good,co-workers were very fun and helpful
good,Job while I was in college. Room for growth. Hi-paced fun environment.
good,move petcoke via railcars loaded into hopper from the crane.
good,"I am very focused on my work, and consequently, am able to work quickly."
good,"The customers who were regulars were great. The employees were cruel. They wouldn't want to help you during a problem, if you were to ask for help they got angry or aggravated. The manager allowed it."
good,"This is a face-paced job and you have to have a lot of free time due to staffing and different closing hours. Depending on the location and the owner you can advance in the company.,"
good,"Between your peers and management, you are constantly being watched, every move. You are then judged by that. Don't get close or befriend anyone, they will stab you in the back to make advancement as you are ranked against your peers. They play favorites.  They act like safety is number 1 until something major happens then it gets covered up. Saw 2 good techs get fired for a verbal altercation but another tech stay after blowing a piece of shrapnel through the building."
good,"When you’re not busy it very boring, but if everyone does their part, it’s an easy laid back job. Small store, but somehow still drama...probably because it’s an all female crew. But for the most part it’s cool, customers are friendly and helpful."
good,This is not a good job to work at. It is so stressful. If you dont stock the cooler correctly you will get written up which is so stupid. I don't recommend anyone to work here. The manager is not a very good one and you also have to clock out what your clock out scheduke says and you still have to finish cleanibg before you leave.
good,"I worked at a privately owned Exxon by the Hollywood casino. The place violated tons of food safety regulations and employees deserve way more money. I worked there for over a year and I worked hard, but I still never got a raise. Co workers were lazy and childish, management barely even existed, and I didn't even get breaks."
good,I would overnight so when trucks came in I was really busy from turn 2 after bar rush is they really busy but between the hours of 3 and 6 it's kind of boring.
good,"It was an average entry level job. The customers were not exactly friendly, but my coworkers were decent and our manager was awesome. Was not a bad summer job."
good,7% company contribution to 401k (i.e. not a match) and competitive salary. Poor work-life balance (avg. 60+ hours/week). Relatively secure job with company policy to redistribute talent during down turns.
good,"Doubt that there are many jobs out there, if any at all, that can offer more stability. That is most certainly true. Unfortunately for hourly wage earners, ExxonMobil knows this and I personally think they use in place of a short-term incentive program or any other bonus. any time the word ""bonus"" is ever brought up, all they ever say is ""at least you have job security."" Not a terrible company to work for, but if you are looking for a place to work that truly values their employees, this is 110% NOT the place for you. Or if you are already working as an operator somewhere else and you are thinking about getting a job with Exxon because you think you'll be compensated more or get better benefits, all I gotta say is that the grass isn't always greener on the other side"
good,"A busy and productive place to work for. Always short staffed but you can get overtime if you wanted it. There is a diverse group of employees, very nice and laid back."
good,"Not much to list about exxon, if your able to get on. Nepotism runs rampant at all facilities. Don’t know if I would take the opportunity if I had an opportunity!"
good,Salaries are in the middle of the bell curve. Corp. culture is rigid & moribund. Performance ranking system is dysfunctional.  Career advancement planning is highly dependent on supervisors hearing about openings by word of mouth.
good,"On the daily basses I mostly did the same thing which it was being a clerk/cashier,  customers purchases check out and assist customers with any needs,  I learnd a lot such as upper management position. The only hardest thing about it was dealing with some of customers behavior or shoplifting other then that it was amazing to be part of that Exxon team we was good one team its was enjoyable going work everyday."
good,Company is very Into hiring and firing if you do anything within 6 months wrong your out the door. Job overall is easy just feel like your there morning to night Monday to Friday and the commute was horrible almost 2 hours or more everyday of driving.
good,While the company is a top employer world wide. The EMBSCC is on the downhill. We provided support services quite well but cost is a bigger concern to them so jobs are being removed and transferred to sweat shops in India and other parts of the world where they have more exploitable work force. There is a reason people are called human resources. Resources are to be used up then discarded.
good,"Be aware that if you are a contractor that you will not receive any opportunities for advancement unless you do WHATEVER your manager tell you, work enormous amounts of overtime, and you’ll pretty much lose every bit of your social/family life."
good,If you are just getting started in the work arena then this place would be a great starter but don’t look to stay there.  I think there is more opportunity for those who are motivated and driven elsewhere.  It is so easy to get comfortable there and not continue to reach for more.
good,A good first job. Not a place to set a career. The tasks were fairly easy and the treatment from management was understanding of needs in the business.
good,"The ""concept"" of working at Exxon was great, loved the location and the flexibility. It was not the best experience coming in as a contractor because they offered no training."
good,"Hard work but the staff are friendly and are willing to work with you. My job title was customer service/clerk but the job itself includes many more duties and responsibilities such as cleaning the store, cooking/preparing food, baking pastries, replenishing stock, etc."
good,It's okay place to work for quick money and find another job while working . Not to be looked at as a career job but a job to help one get out of a financial hold
good,"Low sallary, aftre few years no opportunity for porfesional growth, unexperienced management, no support from management"
good,"The typical day, I would arrive 10-15 minutes early (my job ethic)I would count my drawer, talk shop with customers, count cigarettes, clean the floors, face product, take out trash."
good,"Overall it is a company who gives you a lot of knowledge that u can take with you forever. Training is always a plus in the oil and gas field. A Company of this size, you quickly realize just how the corporate world really is. In- fact, there is no room for promotion."
good,"I work for a privately owned Exxon, I found working for them to have it's perks, but for the most part you work like you own the business without any of the benefits of being an owner. There is limited staffing with one store and this can be problematic when anyone calls out. During busy times there should be more then one person on shift for safety issues and to help with the work load."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Exxon/Mobil mostly for the returning customers I had. Management was also very flexible and easy to work with around my busy schedule, which was a huge plus."
good,"This was a contract position.  I worked for several EXXON managers that were great.  The job was good.  The office was private and time off was accepted.  Contractors, however, for the most part, were invisible."
good,As an assistant manager you have to do everything which is required to run the business and deal with all kind of customers on daily basis. Its a hard working place and serious business
good,"Note: This store was bought out by Timewise, and has gone through changes, since I had left in 2010. "
good,"This was an entry level position for me. Therefore, I didn't expect a large hourly rate. I thought the pay was fair. The boss was good to his employees, and genuinely wanted them to succeed, taking time to show them things they could learn on how to provide great customer service. Manager was also very diligent about making sure we did work well. Quality is the key here, and I noticed he has built a great business of regulars who come in because his station is kept so well."
good,Working at the gas station was a fun experience you meet new people everyday the time goes by pass you always have work to do as well as you do have your issues here & there but nothing you cant handle .
good,"Opportunities like this are hard to come by. Very interesting and challenging work. Travel can be amazing as well. But the culture and environment is an acquired taste."
good,"Difficult customers and employees, not too much room for personal growth.  Large customer base in comparison to other locations, so you'll be constantly busy from start to finish."
good,"Hours/days were incredibly inconsistent, and were decided randomly based on how the manager felt that week. The manager would change the schedule in the middle of the week, and not notify any of the employees. Co-workers were only interested in doing the bare minimum to get their paychecks and go home."
good,"Worst job I ever had. No set pattern. Flavor of the month environment. Some can get away with murder, others get murdered. Safety is talked but not actually done."
good,"Same as previous jobs...this job ended up not getting enough hours to support myself financially. "
good,"Work hours are not balanced, every week the shift changes.  It's good if you have things to do during the day, but tough on your sleep cycle.  "
good,"very good atmosphere to work in."
good,This is a okay company to work for if you like to be micro managed. They have a pension and a good 401k.  They are trying to be a little more competitive with there salary but they are still behind other companies.
good,Great company which follow all guidelines. No true room for advancement under this title. The schedule for the chemist position is not job work/life balanced.
good,"complicated system for jobs to work and jobs completed."
good,"1:1 meetings are a façade as they don't tell you about your performance or things you should improve or work on."
good,"The good thing about working ag mobil is that its family friendly, independently owned and operated, management listens to its employees, its good for a college student just getting out in the world"
good,My experience here was awesome. The 2 gentlemen that owned this particular store were amazing. I met great people. The job is hard because its steady.
good,"I met some pretty awesome people during my time at Exxon but once management became a little foggy, things changed in ways that work for some but not others."
good,"You depend on your management, if they like you, there's room for advancement. IT is not priority so expect work with old tech."
good,"Talk to each other on a casual basis. Say “Good Morning!” with a smile. You don’t need to have"
good,"A great work environment, was provided with anything I required to carry out my job efficiently.  Kept informed and involved in everything that was occurring within the department I was working in.  Really enjoyed all of the people that I had a chance to work with."
good,"you cleaned, stocked, checked in vinders, helped people with finding things and got to hang out with some really cool cops."
good,Working there was just a basic job to help pay the bills.  There is nothing special to say in a bad way or good way about this employer
good,Good pay. No life.  Most people are robotic.  Good travel opportunities.  Do not be different... you will not survive.  The company is very selective and management is lacking.  Everything is political and not merit based.
good,"This job also had a Baskin Robins located inside.  I learned how to properly measure ice cream for shakes, sundaes, etc.  I also learned how to decorate ice cream cakes. I enjoyed being able to try the new ice cream that came out."
good,"ExxonMobil Business Support Center employs more than 1000 people, half of them are foreigners. The company offers free language courses, various trainings, life insurance program, free fruit 2 times per week,ergonomic program and fitness program. They pay average in comparison to similar jobs locally, career prospects are not transparent, new vacancies are not published anywhere. The management is fine, the work ethics allow  to report a mistake immediately, nobody is going to shout at you down for this. They exchange your keyboard, chair, computer for ergonomic ones in case you feel pain from typing. There is a physiotherapist employed in the center for consultation and a fitness trainer coming once per day to motivate workers to stretch. Despite all this benefits many employees are feeling down, as there is little place for creativity or influencing things.The company has many  procedures, safety obsession, lots of supervision. Colleagues in most cases are great, but some teams are too competitive. Typical day consists of a lot of emailing, reporting, some meetings, phone conferences."
good,it was a good job pumping gas for people and running the register and met a lot fo cool people but it is no longer a company anymore.
good,"For the most part this would be an excellent company to work for."
good,Exxon Mobile was a good job at the moment. The manager's  were fun and there were almost never a problem unless an angry customer walked in the station.
good,"Large organization with lots of opportunity. High caliber people. Quality of department management is inconsistent. Strong corporate culture, which has its positives and negatives. Size of organization can be a plus, but occasionally results in moments of getting lost/overlooked."
good,A day on the job is very easy. Punch in then go to your register and await customers. When they place a order in then you go to the kitchen and start cooking. Sometimes I can get really busy so you inform your co-workers for help. The co-workers and management were very kind and collective people. There were no hard parts and the best thing was the free food. I learned more how to cook and handle customers.
good,"No benefits and Not good work delegation"
good,I learned to priortize my day to day operations. The customers always looked forward to seeing me. I provided a clean store.
good,"Aprendi muito em relaçao a liderança de pessoas, gerencia com otimo negocio sem planejamento, como todo ambiente de trabalho existem pessoas muito eticas outras nao, a parte mais dificil sao as açoes nao programadas na maioria das vezes saia algo errado, as viagens era a parte mais agravel."
good,you starting your day by releaving your sale associate than at the right time read your assignment of the day. Good Management. Good Co-Workers.
good,"Ensuring we are ready for rush hours, inventory counting all day long"
good,"Work force tended to be very white and male until a supervisor/manager bucked the trend in the later years. Dismissals were often unfair and created a very uncomfortable work environment. Was told by the older workers it was a harsh Exxon culture. It was not a Exxon-Mobil merge, rather, Exxon devoured Mobil."
good,Exxon is a good company that is flexible to your schedule and has a good customer service. They are understanding and make sure that the customer is always happy.
good,"It was decent place to work at. I learned a lot of new things. Working as an assistant manager, taught me how to actually manage the gas station all by my self"
good,"I am really good with people, especially patients! I'm a very quick learner as well. I have common sense and can problem solve. I have assistant manager experience and can thrive well in Any environment!"
good,"the culture was up and down, The company was brought out by another company and alot of people was cut from there jobs. So the morale was low I had alot of titles to fill in employees that were cut."
good,"We used to do what the name implies, we washed cars. Obviously we would clean and shovel around the place too. Many people were slackers and would not show up most of the time, but the management often yelled at the people that tried, rather than the people who were slacking. I finally got fed up when I not only had to stock the freezers in the store (they had employees who often just stood at the register doing nothing), but I also had to clean mold off the ceilings with water and a rag. Nothing else. It was extremely annoying as I also had to sprint to the car wash to make sure I ALSO washed the cars. They expected too much from the people that tried to work hard because they were so accustomed to people not trying."
good,Enjoyed working there and it sas a great learning experience to help me out in my future cashier jobs. Pay was not good compared to the work you were required
good,Good company with bright future for dedicated people. Room for advancement if wanted; great pay as well as well as benefits for employees. Good opportunity for overtime as well
good,"I loved the relationship I created with the everyday customers. It helped to run a good business and very awesome atmosphere. The manger while I worked here was terrific, always made things very simple."
good,It was challenging at first doing turnaround but the paychecks were excellent and we all worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job was enduring long hours.
good,"A typical day at work is 8 hours in front of a computer."
good,"a day at work was pretty decent just did not like having to be there at 5 in the morning most costumers where friendly to me. my only problem was the pay, it was a cut above minimum wage not enough to do anything with and there was no break time or lunch time."
good,"management needs a refresh, very old school mindset. work life balance is improving. too many meetings. some technically challenging work, though not pervasive."
good,"Decent work, but rude customers and can get stressful. It really depends on the people you work with, that will make the job enjoyable, because some managers can be mean."
good,"Submitting  daily reports on a timely manner"
good,If management was better it would be a great place to work but as is at the moment the management is the bottom of the barrel and violates so many rules to take advantage for themselves. You can have a job today then have it stripped away the next for no fault of your own
good,"The job is a good job, I worked night shifts always had to stay stocked up on drinks and the candy always cleaning that’s mandatory for the job. I liked getting paid weekly always had money coming in"
good,It was nice job to have.  We did not get paid overtime nor holiday pay with no insurance.If someone called in we had to work their shifts with last minute notices.
good,"The best overall that a person could've "
good,"Split  shift limited contract"
good,I worked for an independent Exxon company and not Exxon Mobile. They did not provide benefits. The required overtime for store managers and did not compensate for that. They did not provide adequate monies for employee recruitment.
good,Basic gas attendant job. Only work there part time. Everyone there is very friendly and fun to be around. Most customers that come in are very friendly as well. Toughest part is being outside during the winter. The best part is working during the summer in nice weather and having barbecues on the weekends.
good,"worked 10 minutes from exxon, easy relaxing day without doing too much. didn't have a problem with a lot other then it was slow and didnt do much volume to keep me busy"
good,"Learned a lot while there. Good for individual just starting out in construction. Worked through an agency.  There were many agencies, all doing different things. Need to be more consistent regarding safety."
good,"it was a great place to work, with great people. it was close to home and I worked days. the pay was OK. Was giving time off if need to take care of family"
good,Great opportunities for growth and advancement for those willing to put in the hours. Great benefits and compensation. The company has opportunities to improve workplace culture and promotion of work/life balance - but have made moves in the last year to help with this.
good,Working at Exxon was okay you get to meet and serve different people and it really helps you tolerate people with horrible attitudes you will run across more than a few
good,it was ok  there were a lot of rules for just about everything and you spent a lot of time just figuring out what the rules were and on top of that you had so much work to do if there were just less rules
good,Its a gas station no real hard work. Best part of the job is the interaction with different people. the hardest part maybe getting off on time with last minute arrivals.
good,Managers are supposed to work 50 hours a week however I was working 70+ hours a week due to a high turn over rate because of the owners! Owners are very strict and rude with employees. The female owner often tries to fight or cuss employees. Went down for a knee injury was out almost 2 weeks but still getting someone to drive me to bank deposits and store orders for the owners and they refused to pay me full salary.
good,the job was pretty easy. Can be stressful at times. You clean and stock the store along with managing money. You deal with people every day. You don't get to work a forty hour work week.
good,The work life balance with this company is hard on family life. The company has good systems in place. The focus on the company from an operations stand point is the development of engineers. The movement is too rapid to maintain continuity and leads to poor decisions being made.
good,"The location was convenient, the people were very friendly, and they were extremely concerned about quality of work. There were more full time, and long tenured employee's, that there were contractors. The chances of conversion to full time were just not available for me. I wanted the chance to advance, but that was just not going to happen. As difficult as it was for me to decide to leave, I left with the hope for a better and more promising opportunity elsewhere."
good,The management team lacks greatly when it comes to noticing potential and moving associates up the chain. I was very pleased with the experience I gained through my time spent there.
good,Need to improve a lot because its cultural structure represents all bad points if you consider organisational behaviour
good,My days are very busy. It would be nice to get hired on as a full-time employee and not work as contractor. Work Life balance is good. The location is great and off the freeway. Easy access and great eatery.
good,"ExxonMobil is a very strong and well disciplined company. However, it can be political, robotic, slow moving, and stuck in its ways. I was exposed to many different sections, divisions, organizations, and business-lines while I was at ExxonMobil. One of the primary things I noticed was the culture, happiness, and well being of the employees ranged dramatically section to section. Some areas of the company were very good while others were terrible."
good,it was ok not enough hours management was great there was no team work someone was always stealing and alot of people loss jobs cause of one person stealing
good,"The pinacle of corporate america. Their Clinton NJ site is located about an hour away from Manhattan. Very secure company, but its like molases moving up with this company."
good,need to be competitive with co-workers through a rating system. Jobs are being transferred to other countries. Roles change often.
good,It was a challenging job. As we worked inside the refinery.  Great learing experience. Maintain Payroll for over 300 employees.
good,"Good place to work, but fear of job cuts runs deep as oil prices tumbling down. Bad day for all of us in the OnG industry. Good work/life balance, great support from colleagues and supervisor in dealing with challenges at work."
good,A typical day at work would include getting the job done in a safe and timely fashion. Even with big jobs the workers would all work together in a good environment.
good,Manage change frequently for what reasons is unknown. security is very much needed due to crimes that were committed in parking lot. the store and mercandise is overall in good condition although they should of kept hot stuff pizza
good,"Learned about the oil and gas industry and the tools used at the front end to support systems, sales, and software. Worked with a team of two others to troubleshoot Point of Sales systems at several different Exxon stations. "
good,"I enjoyed working in the control room, it was challenging. There were times when it was very hectic and others just routine. The control room was the hub where all the operators would meet and discuss the shift objectives. Working in this business for the past 28 yrs. your co-workers become family and that means a lot. It was a big change when Mobil merged with Exxon, management constantly rotated."
good,Horrible management and bad employees. I worked very hard to get my job done and finished by the end of my shift but everyone before and after me would jus lazy around. and wait for me to get back to pick up their slack in their poor working habits
good,typically you just clock in an jump right in. You can learn great customer service because your always hands on with customers. The management was great an there wasn't really anything hard about the job once you were properly trained.
good,"A typical day at work consist of a 7:15 morning meeting in which daily work logs are read and work is distributed amongst all employees & contractors. The safety environment at Exxon is second to none, I love the one task at a time mentality. The management can be verry help full at times and at other times they can be a little over board. The employees are sometimes hard to get along with but the contractors are great to work around. The hardest part of the job has to be the stress level & paperwork. The most enjoable part of the job is being in your own environment."
good,Watch the store... cashier.. accept shipments.. Not much to it. Management was fine.. co-workers were fine as well. Hardest part was staying awake since there isn't much to do. Stock some shelves makes the store look clean..
good,My day started by opening the store and getting it ready for business. I would check vendors in through out the day and put away merchandise. I really enjoyed all the different people I got to meet and work with.
good,"Everyday i go to work, it is always busy full of rude people. The manager isn't bad but, could be a better one. Long story short my job didn't keep me happy for long."
good,I worked the grave yard shift and it was not a very safe work environment at a gas station.The pay was not good for the amount of work
good,"Work life balance is good"
good,"Too many layers to manage and execute construction projects "
good,"The benefits are great. The culture is geared towards the younger generation. "
good,The store is family owned and there isn't a lot of benefits such as health care coverage. I am at the end of any chance f advancement and the pay is very weak.
good,"Nice co workers, great benefits, decent pay, strict policies wjekdkvkskxkfkdkckkvdmkcmcmcmcmcmcmcmcmcmcmmcmcmcmcmcmdmdmfnxmmcmcmcmxnxnmccmxmcmmcmcmcmcm"
good,The store I worked for is no longer open. I did enjoy my time there while it lasted. I LOVED my regular customers!!! The owner was fair and caring!!!!
good,"Not for me"
good,"It  is a good experience, an opportunity to learn and grow. Just keep working hard and abiding by business policies and procedures. Thank me later. Keep pushing."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. Seeing new faces constantly, all different types of cars and business trucks coming for their full. Occasionally would help an elderly lady put air in her tire which always felt good to do. Washing windows also meant a potential tip here and there which is always great to received."
good,Meeting new people is the best part of going into work. Some days are better than others but overall a okay place to start working if your a young adult without bills. Pay can be better.
good,"Great people I worked with. The job itself wasn't for me, standing hours on end working a cash register and dealing with interesting customers... some may love it"
good,Working at ExxonMobil headquarters in Melbourne gave me the experience and tools to develop myself to a high level of responsibility and ability to handle critical situations.
good,"Nice perks plenty of uncertainty.  Job security is always in question in the IT sector of the business.  "
good,it was a learning experience .il it recommend to my peers. Infact il reconsider applying again myself .Honestly i have nothing but good memories while working for the company.
good,"Most are oldie managers. Expected all the their paper policies but facts they don’t really how to follow. "
good,Opening store counting merchandise inventory control register count down time clocks bank transactions slow pace work and customers service and security
good,Super Saftey conscious company. Good pay. Descent benefits. 40hr company. Good place to work if you live near by. But entering plant property the traffic is horrible.
good,The stakes are high in the oil industry. ExxonMobil employees need to love their professional area of expertise and demonstrate the highest standards of quality work and honesty in this company because their standards are very high.
good,"Bad management. I had 3 different supervisors in 2 weeks during performance reviews. My supervisor did not know anything about what I did or anything about my work ethics. I received very good feedback from all my knowledgeable others except for one that had more enfluence, therefore was ask to resign or go under performance improvement plan. I resigned!"
good,They were a ok job to work for while being there. They work with my schedule as far as me getting my kids on the weekends. They also gave me the hours i needed.
good,"Exxonmobil is a company that if your not willing to relocate when they need to somewhere else, you will not advance. Family and work will clash."
good,"i like to working hard and i want to be successful by any means"
good,"Management is not very helpful, majority of duties are left on 3-4 employees, a lot of internal and external theft and managers hiring untrustworthy people."
good,I really enjoy working with the public. I am quick and made hardly any mistakes. I had to stick tanks and take trash out and stock coolers. Had to keep up with the fountain drink cups. I worked all by myself which was fine I had no problems.
good,"I've held various positions with this employer, loved most of the positions, great opportunities for development.  After spending close to 20 years there, I think it may be time for a move before retirement."
good,overnight cashier customer service stocked store and all coolers and freezers cleaned store inside and out prepped breakfast for the morning crew made coffie did my end of day and did my lotto and cig count
good,It was a relaxed job the issue was I was not able to work as much because I devoted my time on my education and it did not offer me a set schedule. Due to scheduling I had to move from this job.
good,If you are willing to do alot of manuel work then this will be the job for you to start with. The coworkers are very friendly and are willing to help you if you dont understand
good,"Hard working place in the scorching sun, only got paid 11$ an hour completely not worth it just gained working experience from all of it nothing else really"
good,"Overall, Exxon is an ok company to work at. The compensation is good, but this wouldn't be the ideal place if work/life balance & thriving company culture are top things you're looking for."
good,It's an ok job. I mean I loved working there it's good people you really meet all kinds of people working in a convenient store. You find out just who does what in your town
good,My aunt was my manager. My opinion is bias towards rhe work environment or anything revolved around the business.it was family owned and operated. But i was benefited in one way.
good,"•	Maintain personal passwords and keep IDs active"
good,"Usually very busy from the moment I would clock in. My managers were very nice but not exceptional. There was a balanced mix of types of people for customers and All ethnicities. The hardest part of the job was dipping the gas tanks for a gas reading. The stick was more than twice my height. The best part was a lot of really friendly people were my customers, fun to talk to when I was able. It was kind of rough on days that my co-worker would call off work and I had to work alone. The store would be very quiet."
good,It's a good job but wouldn't make a career out of. Where I am at now seems to be playing favorites and there is no room for that in any job. I am looking for something that I can help people with no conflict behind me.
good,Most of my time would be behind the cash register checking people out. Hardest part would be working by yourself during busy hours. Most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people everyday some friendly some not so much. I learned that being patient is a great thing to help make your day less stressful.
good,"Every person in Exxon works alone on their shift. I always like to work so I kept myself busy stocking the coolers, stocking the cigarettes, and every other merchandise that needed to be filled. I would clean the bathrooms, unload the trash on each pump, and inside the store. For me the hardest part of the job was lazy employers that made it hard for me because I would end up doing their job and mines. I enjoy the customer satisfaction I provided for the customers. I made sure coffee was always freshly made. All cigarettes were put out, and every drink availible  was put out so we would not miss a sale. I learned there that great customer service applies everywhere you work. That people always remember and appreciated a pleasant exprience versa a bad one. That good customer service is always good for business."
good,"Exxon is a good place to work if you are a teenager in school. Quick money. They start out at $8.50/Hour  and you are paid weekly and its quick to get a raise, your checks could well be over $280/week if you work enough hours. If you are out of school and in college, that could be an issue because they want you to work more hours and you can say goodbye to your social life. your shifts could range from 9 to 12 hours. Some days they will have you closing a whole week and it would be torture. I hardly have a social life anymore. Every day you cashier customers or you would be on the other side of the store cashing checks. The hardest part would have to be that some customers can be quite rude and entitled. That goes from both the store side and the check cashing side. I really do enjoy my coworkers are they are fun to be around and shifts go by quick if you work with your favorite coworker."
good,"Performing general office duties including but not limited to the delivery of outdoor and indoor mails and documents, photo-copying and binding work"
good,"The job was so relax, but the money was not enough to pay the bills. Everyone there was so super nice and willing to help each other out. Would have love to stay there for ever"
good,This was a great place to learn some of my customer service skills that have carried me over through my career.  I think this is a great place for anyone to start their career.
good,good but not challenging place at least on business support centers.     There are low cost places with just support administrative work and no place to grow.
good,"It's a slow paced environment if you're the type that doesn't like fast- paced environment. Hours were decent, pay was decent also. the only thing I didn't like about working here is that when I was pregnant and I had doctors apt they never wanted to work around that then I got fired 3 days after going into unexpected labor."
good,"This was a 24/7/365 work environment in a sometimes difficult neighborhood. Employee rollover was too high, and I was basically on-call at all times. A stressful job, to say the least."
good,"where I worked, the management was terrible.  thieving and placing the mistakes on the employees, management not working and making employees work early or later than scheduled."
good,I answered the phone took orders and made the best pizza for my customers my day went by straight I just made pizzas all day and cleaned prepped and washed dishes
good,"No ping pong tables - at all. This is a stable job, but there are almost no career growth opportunities. At least for my role. Also, Exxon prefers to hire cheap labor - so, try not to work for them as a contractor"
good,"ExxonMobil is one of the highest paying jobs in the area, however, the corporate culture is stifling and they only promote from within so ideas are stale."
good,Too much corporate politics. No doubt it's the largest energy company and if give the opportunity to go and work for the I will definitely consider then
good,"It was a very unstable work place with a lot of deceit. But besides that, the money was straight they made sure they paid me. That's my  experience as stocker for Exxon"
good,Its a ok place to work. You are not a constant work schedule it changes all the time. The co-workers there are amazing its a great starter job... everyone is very friendly
good,Overall this was a good place to work.Had a great team to work with. At times the job could be very demanding and sometimes had to work in high heat for extended periods of time. Always kept hydrating fluids in the area.
good,ExxonMobil is a company that gives back to the community. They have taught me a lot since I've been there and I enjoyed working with many of the folks I've met at ExxonMobil.
good,"No review for this company at this time.  At this particular department, no room for advancement and promotion. Management is sometimes clueless to the overall culture of the department"
good,"I was a cashier, money transactions and stocking coolers and aisles ."
good,The breaks was good and long for the most part but the schedule was very messed up having to switch from day shift to night shift every week with only a day to get your sleep schedule changed
good,"Empresa con muchos beneficios contractuales, pero con tareas muy operativas."
good,"ExxonMobil is very hierarchical, making it difficult to get your skills and talent recognized without putting in years in the company. Technology is not as cutting-edge as in IT companies but with the limited skillset of current talent it's easy to stand above them in annual reviews (even if it does not help with pay raise)."
good,Good place to get basic skills obtained as a start out position while working through high school. works on your people skills and money handling skills
good,EMCO is a contract company that assigned me to ExxonMobil exclusively. The job opportunity has no growth potential and no foreseen opportunity to be hired on to ExxonMobil itself. This means that a person will most likely be in the same position for there whole career.
good,"I was a contract driver. Good money and good times. It was hard to see this job go, but that's the life of contract work. Would definitely work for them again."
good,Enjiyed my job the customers were real nice people one you got to know them . Hapoy to have met my fellow emoloyers they all where great love the environment with the emolyers nice job
good,"Didn’t work there long enough but it was a decent place to work , decent paced and low stress. Co - workers were helpful and honest .Not a bad place to work at all."
good,"They understand that people have lives outside of work, and that these lives might sometimes impinge on (or even take over) their time and attention. They realize that allowing for some work-life give and take means not only that they won’t waste time and money on unnecessary turnover, but that they’ll build loyalty and commitment. They know it’s give and take, not give or take."
good,most of the customers coming were regulars. We would see the same people everyday. You get to know them and what they want. You stay busy all day and have a coworker to help with duties.
good,"Company always does well.  Stock has appreciated tremendously over the years.  It is bureaucratic, but a large corporation like that would need to be."
good,"Offshore platform. A ton of clashes. One of the clients changed the height of all the levels, to save money. But left no room. Very unfriendly client that made bad choices that reflected back on us. but I'm sure they all got a big bonus at the end of the job."
good,it was a great job that gave me the chance to meet new people every day and grow more responsible with my work ethic it was a awesome opportunity that i wont forget
good,"ExxonMobil has outstanding benefits, but in order to succeed you are required to conform to a conservative culture that stresses reliability over innovation. The company is extremely resistant to change."
good,I really enjoyed working as a contractor for ExxonMobil my previous supervisor Angie Beard Thompson was an amazing person and learned a lot from her. Work environment was great. Every day was  a challenging day after changing supervisors. The workplace was amazing and would recommend it to anyone. Rate of pay was fantastic. I learned a lot and wished I could have stated longer. Working in the QA/QC department was a challenge. Overall the colleagues were great towards me. Always tried to make me feel comfortable.
good,"Everyone knows ur business  "
good,"I spent 25 years working for this company rising to mid level management. I would still be working there but after the merger with Mobil Oil, many mid level managers were laid off."
good,Sometimes it could be unbearable because of the management. Other then that it was a decent enough place to work. I would just like something different.
good,This job at The Montage Exxon was an ok job? I was making my ends meet. The hooked me up with a stipend of $20.00 a week for free gas as part of working there.
good,"No lunches or breaks. Must serve the customers at all time.  As a cashier, if you work over night, must handle all complaints/issue with the customers."
good,Every day was a difficult day in dealing with corporate policies for dealerships. Workplace culture at the dealership was very friendly and professional.
good,"stocking and ringing up customer purchases"
good,the job was easy but the people where harder to get use to coming in and out. once you build a routine it becomes a easy and fun job.I enjoyed my time at exon
good,EM has good work life balance but the compensation structure and performance evaluation process is very subjective. Management is not clear on a set standard of goals and objectives that are expected in order to be successful. Performance evaluations are more a popularity contest than based on actual achievements throughout the year. Service organizations are not paid fairly unless your an executive. Job concentrations in Engineering and IT are highly valued.
good,Great job if your an employee. They do not value their contractors and let you know daily that you are expendable. Management will look to blame contractors.
good,"typical day is run register all day, stock cigarettes and tobacco, keep store clean, keep cooler stocked and shelves stocked, keep coffee made and beer pulled to front of cooler"
good,"Typical day involves working on my priorities for the week"
good,"gossip and drama is all that was,  hours sucked,  paychecks sucked,  poorly managed,  co workers are rude,  they didn't do their jobs,  just stood around"
good,Typical day at work was hectic and crazy. I learned that the customer is always right no matter the situation. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the homeless and thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job was the occasional great customers that came in.
good,Flexible work schedule that allows you to be off throughout the week and off every other weekend. Great health benefits. And opportunities to do volunteer work which I enjoy.
good,"ExxonMobil is a decent company to work for. "
good,"Dallas management is out of touch with boots on the ground. Support Services are the red headed step children, and everyone knows it. Hard to fathom a 30+ career somewhere that doesn't value your contribution"
good,"Pays the bills, it a big company and there are always hours available to work. I have learned a lot and I am certified as a forklift operator. The hardest part of my job is trying not to make any mistakes. Safety is always first with this company,"
good,"Gained experience in all aspects of running a store, both good and bad. Best part of the job was the customers. Gained experience in ordering and working with venders."
good,I was a contractor there. I had limited acces to administration tasks. Most of the telecom network stuff was done in houston and that did not do me any good as far as my skills. They were sold to PBF energy which is good for me because I get a chance to utilize my skills.
good,Had good benefits and was easy to move up to management if wanted hours were not stable  but still good place to work for to meet new people and learn more inventory rules
good,this particular job was an entry level chemist position directly out of college. it serve the purpose for that time frame. It was a stepping stone and an opportunity for experience in the field.
good,all of the exxons in town have closed in town since I have worked there. but all around it wasn't a bad job just had little room for advancement I would work there again
good,"I learned much abut the financial side of the drilling side of the oil and gas industry. The management there were very friendly and the atmosphere was not to stuffy like other big businesses. Also, its a great place to meet alot of vendors if you feel you want to move on to another company in the future."
good,"Yes, while you got to meet new people every day and you had regular customers, the job it self can be really boring. On the other hand if you like people and no challenge, the this is the place for you."
good,"Environment is toxic due to pettiness, and obscene language. They actually have a swear bucket, and it is usually full. Worker's are required to control things, but have no authority to do so."
good,"a typical day off work would be handling lots of customers,. Stocking and maintaining the aisles, keeping a tidy sales floor and register area as well as cleaning and tidying other stuff in store such as the glass panes, gas pumps, back rooms."
good,there is good and bad in the way they do business but im just a average employee what do i know. they need to try to get employees to stay and not leave a week down the road and learn how each employee works.
good,its was alright helping people you would have to catch people stealing fixing things it was very fast to work and a lot of customers are rude with you
good,"I've worked at Mobil as a fuel attendant, and while there were some employees who were taking the job seriously there were others who could not give a half baked horse about their work. One coworker would arrive half an hour late or not even show up on her shift. To be fair, this job is usually targeted by young high school students. That does not excuse their nonchalant attitude and refusal to do their job. Other than that, I have no complaints."
good,this is a great place for engineers I plan to do medical research . This is why I don't have any liking to this place. The employee culture Is great at this time
good,I knew the owner of this store and his son and I got along well so when his son was my manager I loved it and had a fun time with customers but when they switched management I had struggles.
good,"Exxon was a unique experience in location and corporate responsibility. "
good,Management is very understanding of personal issues that might arise. Love the customers and enjoy doing my job. Customers are usually in and out and purchases are simple to do with the register.
good,Fast paced environment. Have to keep up with the demand of testing to support product development. Involves hard work and lots of standing. Work is always busy.
good,I liked working here the people was very nice and I like my coworkers they was as nice as they could be. I loved the hours and the pay. My coworkers made sure if u need3d help they was there for you.
good,It was an okay job just not enough staff. People hardly ever came to work on time and nothing was done about it. I enjoyed assisting customers. It was not a hard job over all.
good,"I loved my customers and environment, but there was drama between two members of management I couldn't deal with. My mentality is when you're working, you're there to work - not make friends. It was too social oriented and there were only a couple co-workers who felt the same and did their work. That being said, I felt like it was too much work for too little pay. I would also be scheduled to close til 12am one night and be back in at 8-9 am the next morning, so scheduling was also a big problem for me since they wouldn't work with me at all on that."
good,"people that work there can be very messy so much so it takes away from the work that needs to be done."
good,Several years of regulatory coordinating with several companies while providing updates and recommendations to management team as it relates to oil and gas regulations and rules.
good,Loved working for the cooperation did not like working there once it was privately owned as much. I was solid work and consistent until it was takien over by owners whom were not experienced as much.
good,"This is a great job with great benefits and pay, but that is all.  The shiftwork is not healthy and management is clueless.  You are allowed to do your own work at your own pace which is good.  Again, pay is good for a single man or married man with no kids or maybe 1.  The work environment is somewhat relaxed.  It is always heavy on safety but they want the work done now, which totally collides with getting it done safely sometimes.  The managers are usually fresh out of college about 3 years and don't have a clue how to run the place."
good,Great place to work you must be willing to travel all over the world pays good sometime the jobs has good benefits dental plan
good,"i have already reviewed this company.ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses technology and innovation to help meet the world’s growing energy needs. We hold an industry-leading inventory of resources and are one of the world’s largest integrated refiners, marketers of petroleum products and chemical manufacturers."
good,always on time always had something to do kept busy made sure coffee was fresh for my customers greta customer service skills were used. always had repeated customers got to know he people
good,"Short term contracts are reviewed by management and they will extend it or release as deemed by performance. The atmosphere was very pleasant, great group of people to work for. Very friendly and great cafeteria, and gift store. Building is extremely clean, covered parking for all employees."
good,"This company doesn't exist anymore, so there is no point in writing or even submitting a review but they were ok to work for"
good,The store I was working for I worked for two. The gm for both is awful. I would never work there again.. Nothing is ever done right nor do you talk to your employees like they are dirt.
good,"This is a very fast apt restaurant, each store is in complication for the number nd people from all over .  You had your regulat I think t o to much emotion involved"
good,"A typical day at work, would be to review stock and inventory. Having problem solving skills in junction to customer service and handling any issue in a timely fashion. I've learned how to multitask as well as handle the company's money. Managing the company's orders and food distribution. Co-workers were friendly but come and go. The hardest part would be to stay overnight for people who didn't show up. The most enjoyable would be the satisfaction of customers, and upbeat environment."
good,"I enjoyed working for the public there and trying to fulfill my.expected duties that was difficult with high volume of customers as a manager and doing register,and ordering,and do certain types of people you have to deal with.The pay was poor."
good,for more or less they really dont care about there employees very much and i feel as though i was hugely under paid. i wouldnt want to work there ever again it just wasnt for me .
good,"Great place to learn about different people. Great co-workers, once you get a hang of the customers and the other employees you will have fun. You really do not feel like you are working."
good,Assessed customer needs and responded to questions. Cleaned and 			straightened work area. Issued receipts for purchases and gifts. 				Worked with customer service to resolve issues. Weighed food to 			determine correct pricing. Operated cash register with proficiency. 			Worked overtime shifts during busy periods.Conducted daily pre-shift 			and weekly departmental meetings to ensure organizational efficiency.
good,I come to work and count the register. Make sure that everything is done correctly. I learned how to work with people no matter the situation. My co-workers were always on the same page as me. The hardest part of the job i want to say was keeping count of cigarettes.
good,Location is difficult as the weather is hot and humid.  Training inadequate.  Good co-workers.  Unit support presents opportunity for improvement.
good,"ExxonMobil is full of robots who adhere to whatever guidelines are thrown out, and why wouldn't they, the pay and benefits are bar-none."
good,"While working at the Exxon shop, I was able to see an opportunity and to act on it by developing a new program for after-hours clients as well as the rental car program and new training programs. The management was extremely supportive and I was given the latitude to explore and plan these new programs, while supervising and training the technical staff."
good,I worked through a corporate contracting company and they were not very secure in maintaining employment for their contractors.  The position was very easy although training was minimal.
good,"i was summer help. so all i did was clean the parking lot and mowed the lawn. timed the bushes, Clean bathrooms mop the floor things like that"
good,"Review Process is less than desirable; not objective"
good,Exxon is a very large plant that always had work just not a lot of overtime. Its a very dirty place to work and hot. Its a ver safe place to work.
good,Working at ExxonMobil has been the greatest opportunity so far in my life. I have enjoyed working with multiples and diverse tasks on the daily basis. From ExxonMobil I have learned to balance life and work. The hardest part of the job was to interact with multiple people and finding discrepancies in data store in library.
good,"At Exxon mobile, as a gas attendant the job was very demanding. Pumping gas is very easy but attending numerous costumers at the same time was difficult. my math skills weren't too great but working there improved them."
good,No management help. Catty people. Good job for high school only.Not enjoyable. Management always blaming lower level employees. No room for growth.
good,"Reviewed employment applications and resumes"
good,"There are some very good people there, the clashes with management are highly apparent, it enjoyed the opportunity while it lasted. I was hoping to transfer closer to home, but I was terminated instead."
good,Worked with logs and maps for the Geo group.  Was very physical and fast paced yet fun to learn and meet new people in the industry.
good,"I enjoy working with the public I enjoy the fast pace work. It's a real good kind of place to work meet variety of people. Management is great here, not to many raises. Over all it's a good job."
good,"Some customers were very rude to me and other gas attendants, treated us like we were nothing, yelled at us, swore at us, etc."
good,A typical day would consist of lifting up to 50 pounds and a lot of cleaning. I learned a little more about cooperation and team work
good,the manager was very rude and did not do a good job of taking care of stock and inventory making it hard to my job as a cashier. she was also steeling money out of cash register and blaming it on other employees. the work environment was very unstable and hostile.
good,"A typical day at Exxon was what one might expect for a gas-station. Although most of the processes and knowledge I acquired were rather simple, the hardest part of the job was handling lottery tickets. I eventually got the gist of how to operate all Lotto transactions, but I most enjoyed the customers and people I worked with."
good,cashier stocker supervisor growing withing company fast paced environment good place learn customer service skills always looking for good help
good,I like the job and everything I did but the moved over 60 miles away and i didnt renew my contract with them. Not willing to move
good,it was pleasant.  I would not call it a career opportunity because I was just a hourly employee but my overall experience with the company was outstanding and I would recommend others to seek employment there.
good,An ideal place for a first job. They worked around school schedule and sports. Taught responsibility in the work place.
good,"There were many issues on the daily basis that needed to be resolved for customers. Management worked with employees' schedules, but did not always show appreciation for them. I enjoyed working with a lot of my co-workers."
good,"Highly demanding job  responsibilities and schedules, but great working experiences overall."
good,Great gas station. great employees. Busy Location. Amazing car wash. had a great experience.
good,"its a nice decent job."
good,"Working at the gas station was the first place I worked once I moved to Newburgh. The basic responsibilities included cash register management, stocking, taking inventory, and assisting customers. I was able to work on my communication skills, but it was difficult to work long night shifts and attend classes in the morning."
good,Managed to learn a lot from working in this company. Colleagues are all excellent & helpful.
good,"Safety responsibility for all,( i.e. clients contractors )"
good,"I was paid handsomely and got amazing opportunities.  That said, the culture was horrific.  With a seriatim ranking system, it was everyone for him/herself.  I came from Mobil Oil pre-merger, where I was accustomed to team based variable pay. It drove very different behaviors.  After nearly 8 years, I took a scant handful of colleagues into my life post XOM."
good,"Pretty simple going place, many days I've worked there had busy moments of people coming in to buy smokes and gas up their cars. Operating the car wash machines to clean customer's cars was fun."
good,Enjoyed working for the comany.Cares about workers. Great management
good,"Temporary contract position •	Support refinery operations contract services in planing, management and administration of contracts to vendors"
good,Ok job to work at as a teenager.  Great experiences but had to move on
good,"great company to work for, learned quite a bit.  In my short period of employment I learned the basics of being a manual machinist."
good,"well it was an ok job at some point in my life it help with tbe bills , and for a younger person who need some extra money"
good,great place but looking forward to returning to school. too much conformity
good,"Pros – Pays at top of scale. Good vacation policy for new hires with experience. Still has a retirement plan."
good,"IT is not an ExxonMobil priority, which should  not be surprising given ExxonMobil's industry."
good,Here I was able to gain much knowledge of the corporate world. Huge corporations run slightly different than medium and small business. I learned more regarding policy and organization than direct job skills. I was able to attend school and earn money at a job that provided me professionalism and bureaucracy. I maintained merger data disk inventory and did overflow work for all team members.
good,Very difficult to make quotas and that seemed to be all managment cares about.
good,I worked evening shift waiting on customers and took care of diningroom.
good,"The day would start early in the morning we got lots of customers it could crazy at this time. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Exxon. I learned a lot about cars that I never knew before, thanks to my helpful co-workers. Over time i enjoyed being around cars. The hardest part of the job was cleaning my hands after work."
good,I worked as a auto appraiser.  My dad was in the body shop business for 30 years.  I got the experience but liked property insurance better.
good,"Responsible for collecting payments from patrons frequenting a gas station. Accept payments for gas, food, medicine, cigarettes, or alcohol and deliver change. Fill patrons' gas tanks if necessary."
good,"Typical work day comprise of  preparing  mailing forms to customers, categorization through mail and perform a variety of administrative duties by using Microsoft Office Suite."
good,As a retail company they focused to much on safety and not enough on customers.
good,It was  a nice place. Polite mangers and co workers. The hardest thing about the job was going into the cold cooler to restock the cooler
good,"My review of this job is well maintain. I loved my co-workers, we were very pleased with each others behavior on the job. We got our daily work done daily on time before our shifted ended."
good,"worked hard constantly"
good,I enjoyed being appreciated by my manager enough to be promoted to Assistant  Manager within the first six months I was employed. Enjoyed learning new skills everyday along with learning new computer system software. 
good,"Too focused on results, not people. Felt like you were ""working for the man"""
good,"Extremely laid back, control of the register and gas pumps. "
good,starting my day with smiling faces dealing with customers. running the whole store working with co-workers was the fun part of my job. leaving the store to go get inventory for the store. depositing money. having a good relationship with my employees and my customers. 
good,"Decent workplace, when i was working there they were going through owner changes."
good,I enjoy my employment with Mobile Gas but I am seeking stability and full-time employment to further my career and knowledge. The most important part about my job that I enjoy is providing # 1 effective customer service.
good,"• Performs a variety of clerical and administrative support duties including, but not limited to providing assistance to the record center with logistics needs for upcoming move to new facility, assist ExxonMobil staff, clients, and vendors."
good,"Each day was pretty much the same, usually the same customers everyday or every two days. I learned about how to sell tobacco and alcohol and keeping calm when in a difficult situation. The management wasn't all that great when I had left to college, but now its new management. All my co-workers were the best to work with. The hardest part of the job was then the manager kept putting me to work the night and close by myself because it was hard to get all my duties done and close the store in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part was that my co-workers were pretty laid back so there wasn't any tension between any of us."
good,"ok place to work, they only want part time employees i need full time"
good,"good place 2 work ,,would meet all types of co wokers , .worked as a cashier ,,did paper work .like seeing my reglaur customers"
good,"My early day, six am, starts with the opening of the facility and setting up front of the house items for the day. The best part of my job consists of getting to know the customers by name and knew what they were purchasing before they came in the door. It made for a comfortable day that put with the bonus of smiling faces."
good,"my day was always busy and productive, i learned how to operate a car wash, my managers were always helpful and supportive, my co-workers were friendly and dependable, was closing at the end of the day, was meeting new people and talking with my co-workers."
good,"This facility has various divisions that are run differently from one another. Some are run better than others, and are evident by the attitudes of the workers. There are some instances of management who have grudges against other management, thus hampering growth from within. Nepotism runs rampant in some divisions and keeps moral low. The decisions that are made in regards to becoming a supervisor are some of the worst choices. Oddly enough, across the fence its the exact opposite. The chemical plant has its quirks but at least they are somewhat fair and level compared to the refinery. Engineers dont normally stick around for too many years if they can help it. Its not what you know its who you know when it comes to advancement into a position you may actually want."
good,"On a typical work day, I would open the store print up the paperwork, make sure the inventory is correct, check in vendors, put up the truck, cleaning, making coffee, etc..."
good,"Highly hazardous job,must be oraganized at all times and very flexiable for relocation, co workers are great, management could be alot better"
good,The store was sold to Circle K. Exxon paid their employees a good rate of pay.
good,For me I used to work nights it was quiet I got everything done. the store was set up for the morning shift. I learned that I shouldn't be too friendly with customers. My co-workers were great I can't say a bad thing about any of them. The hardest part was that I was the only one working there overnight so when it got busy it was rough. The most enjoyable is if I would get an occasional morning or afternoon shift and I got to work it with another co-worker we knew what we had to get done and we got it done hours before we were scheduled to come off.
good,"The gas station was very accommodating to my change in schedule when I went back to school. My coworkers were very pleasant, and my employer was very understanding with my mistakes, as long as I remained diligent in my work."
good,Working was great except for the robberies I endured and lived near bad part of town so some of the customers were tough to maintain but overall was great manger and friends I made
good,Great stepping stone.  Unfortunately upper management were poorly organized making it different to pursue a career with Exon.  I would not suggest Exxon and or this position as a starting point for young people.
good,I enjoyed working with new people an seeing your regular customers. Unfortunately the owner sold his store an was bought by someone eles or Id still be working there.
good,The competition there was intense and you were likely to get a knife or two in your back if you were not careful.  I also have had better benefits at smaller companies.
good,Didn't receive enough hours and the pay was entirely too low for all the work you have yo do. Most of the tire your relief never showed. Would be my last option of work.
good,I was a contractor at Exxon/Mobil.  My job was to train expats during the offshore transition.  I was responsible for some operated and non-operated properties.  The operated property generated substantial revenues.  The non-operated or non-core properties were offshore to Argentina.  I learned that it was very difficult to work in an environment where jobs were being sent to another country.  I felt that it had an impact on the employees morale.  I believe the hardest part of job was communicating and training people from a different country.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see where your hard work paid off by accomplishing the objectives and goals that were set.
good,"Great place to start but conflicted with school since hours were so steady. (9-5 , 2-10) etc. Gave me tons of customer service skills. I enjoyed  my co workers and the open environment.There's many tasks, not just standing in one spot all day."
good,"I have been there for about 2 years, but my time at ExxonMobil was fun. However, when you're a contractor, and you know there's no advancements, it's not motivating."
good,"A good place to build or gain customer service skills."
good,"This can be a good place for you if you like oil & gas but I would recommend getting out early if you don't."
good,"ExxonMobil is a good company, but is not a good fit for everyone. They pay well, but their performance assessment structure does not foster team work or collaboration. If you are tolerant of bureaucracy and things moving slow then you will be OK. Most stay for the good pay and benefits, but afraid those are the highlights."
good,"Great benefits and pay is ok but not the highest. Management is a revolving door, if you don't like someone wait 6 months and there will be a new regime. People are ok but there is always a bad apple in each group."
good,"Not a place for career development and growth, It pays well, but frequent movement from one role to another, training is really poor, one will not get a chance to learn anything here"
good,"Good place to work, nice facilities and great people.  Very traditional work environment, having difficulty adapting to modern technologies and innovation."
good,"E' una grande azienda di elevato livello ma con tutti i difetti delle aziende americane che pensano di gestire i dipendenti senza alcuna attenzione ai contratti locali Europei ed Italiani, trasferendo persone senza alcun riguardo alle situazioni individuali e personali, così come avviene in America."
good,"I was on loan to ExxonMobil from my parent company Jacobs Engineering for 10 years.  We had a continuous service agreement with Exxon  to support their Pipeline Engineering Group.  Although I was not an Exxon direct employee,  I always heard good things about  their benefits package etc."
good,"cut throat management style"
good,"ExxonMobil treats employees very well when it comes to benefits and compensation.  The vacation policy is old compared to many companies today.  You get 2 weeks starting out then 3 weeks at 5yr anniversary, 4 weeks at 10yrs, 5 weeks at 20 Yr and 6 weeks at 30 years."
good,"Diverse, brilliant employees who unfortunately only care about their paycheck."
good,"Liked the job but I was a contract worker, treated like employee. Found that there was allot of hidden stress. Many people were overworked and felt forced to work. I saw many people leave with each change of management which happens every 2 to 2.5 years."
good,"As a former Exxon  employee, my experience had helped me improving my customer service skills, the use of the cash register, and being  bilingual girl."
good,I like working job was dependable and easy to learn . Would like to work there again.but at a different location.always great on gas and other items.like
good,"EM has a competitive culture that encourages self-promotion within management guidance. The challenges from my experience include changing market (restructure of contemporary oil products), limited technical expertise,  and redirecting management initiatives. It is a fun environment but is corporate functioning with many facets - manufacturing, projects, business analyst, management, etc. "
good,"I enjoyed working there, and planned to spend a career there, however, the medical department created more stress, and superseded the decision of my cardioligist"
good,"this place is ideal for professionals with families. generally no opportunities for personal improvement or career, average age is very low and people tend to leave after about a year."
good,Its ok if u like drama. If u kiss butt u can get far here. U dont get paid enough  for what u do. But working with the public is fun. It a fast pace job. There is always something to do here
good,Alot to do stocking cashier cleaning some cooking and serving food.regular customers liquor store on one side.its in a good location.places for truck drivers to park awhile.greyhound bus stops here
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo, estuve casi cuatro años, aprendí y crecí mucho. "
good,It was a 40 hour week with tasks laid out by my supervisor to complete daily. I did have my regular daily tasks along with monthly and annual tasks to complete. Management was typical over all. Co workers were approachable for the most part.
good,"-Good school learns a lot"
good,"Exxonmobil es muy buena empresa para trabajar aprendi mucho sobre recursos humanos, customer service, controles, en hacer el trabajo de mejor manera y sin errores."
good,"enjoyed seeing the customers most were daily customers, management was amazing, always willing to listen and give guidance, most unenjoyable part of the job was dealing with some of the other employees I felt intimidated towards the end of my career."
good,"To start off, at the beginning of my shift I would first have to count my register and then everything else that is in the booth, like the safe, scratch off, and cigarettes. After, make coffee and put some items on the grill while still attending to the customers. Later, do the back stock, fix the cooler, and clean the inside and outside of the store. Also, I would take vendors when orders are coming in and sign them into the book. I learned how to order some of the items that we would need for the store. If my co-workers need help with sometime they didn't mind asking me for help. The hardest part of the job is always trying to find something to do. The most enjoyable part of the job enjoying some of the customers."
good,"Corporate culture is very competitive.  Rating / ranking modeled after typical corporate systems putting employees into thirds against their peers within their groups.  Difficult to improve / damage ranking after the initial placement at >1 yr with the company.  Advancement largely tied to the success of your supervisor and the ability to politically campaign for yourself."
good,"ExxonMobil is a good place to work, but is worried more about making money than its workers.  You are just a number to them that can easily be replaced with contractor given the chance.  There are great supervisors and then the others.  The company preaches family and personal safety and health, but when it come time to miss an extended about of work because of an injury or a major illness in you  immediate family, it is looked down upon when you return from missing work.  You are treat like the red headed step child because you missed work and you missed it because of personal health or to take care of a family member.  I was next in line for supervisor when i had major heart problems and age 35 and had to miss a good bit of time, and upon my return all i recieved was negative attitudes from management, written up for something I didnt do, and pretty much told I had lost my chance from advancement."
good,"Good pay, good work.  As a consultant not much opportunity to advance."
good,I deal with hundreds of people everyday and i believe that is why i enjoy my job so much!
good,"Es una empresa muy buena para laboral, al ser multinacional permite tener asignaciones de corto plazo en el exterior."
good,At Exxon I learned how to work with many different kinds of personalities.
good,What I learned was how to work 12-hour rotating shifts and that is also the hardest part of the job because your personal life comes second sometimes. The management is ok could be better. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of my co-workers and the pay.
good,- working from 1pm-10pm but because of the pressure given to me i usually finish at 12am and I actually cannot related my work to my career.
good,"ExxonMobil is an excellent company for making a career. It gives excellent treatment to its employees. The given tasks are well measure because the company cares a lot for the employees mental and physical health. "
good,"Great Compensation. You are most definitely compensated richly. However, the work life balance is poor and seems to be leaning more on the work side. Also, the environment in highly competition, but not in a way that support health individual growth, its more or less taking credit for good work and displacing credit for bad work"
good,I didn't feel respected as a senior member of my team.  the bottom line was more important than maintaining the workforce.  Our work was outsourced to a foreign country to save money.
good,"-ExxoMobil is a great employer that tends to recruit fresh graduates to educate them with their beliefs, rigid controls and processess system throughout their career journey. "
good,"Great place to work. Management was pretty hands off as long as you do your job.  The only thing that was discouraging was if you were a contractor, it may take a very long time to get employed by the company."
good,"As a Co-op, learned a lot and was exposed to a wide variety of projects."
good,I enjoyed everything about the job i stock everything from shevels to coolers also did kitchen work and love my customer no one can say they left my store unhappy
good,"Exxon has been loyal to it's employees.  The company demands a lot and the company has great benefits.  The only flaw that I saw in the company, I thought they didn't allow you to grow within the company.  I believe Exxon has a system that predicts how far you will advance within the company based on the school you attended.  I believe that's a mistake.  I believe continue to improve throughout their career regardless of the school they attended.  Last, Exxon paid for their employees education but has the tendencies of letting there people go work for their competitors versus recognizing their advance degrees."
good,"Flexible work schedule, check equipment  make sure everything is working properly, monitor and clean equipment, assist the manager on his duties, inventory"
good,"Prepare yourself for lots of meetings. With a company this size all decisions require input from a significant amount of individuals, all of whom will only see things from a siloed business perspective. The company is attempting to change but actionable steps are hard to come by with a resistant culture. Ranking system awards those whom are liked instead of those who complete necessary work. Lots of projects are started with few being finished before being thrown into production."
good,the company allowed time for extra activities but it is now privatised. i enjoyed working at that time but there was not much room for career progression
good,want a challenge ...nice atmosphere and great coworkers. want to work on heavier jobs. clean attire provided. coworkers. want to work on heavier jobs. easy work
good,Working at ExxonMobil can be very financially rewarding. Salaries are among the top in the industry. Working the rotating shift can be difficult on family life though.
good,"This place is slow at supplying you with the tools needed to perform your job, unorganized, and indecisive in certain matters.  I was suppose to be there for a 1-year assignment.  After much less than a year of working there, my manager came to me at the end of the week and notified me with no prior warning, that they no longer required my services.  I was ushered out of the place like I was a criminal.  Before this, I had received no complaints about my work of any kind."
good,"Not all ExxonMobil sites are the same. Beaumont promotes based on “good ole boy” of who you know. There is very little diversity, mostly white males.  The ranking system which is used to do salary increases and raises is also based on who you know not performance. Same people get the raises every year."
good,"Do payroll and staffing first thing in the AM. Start of Shift Safety meeting.  Would oversee the days mechanical work and first out permits.  Write all Blue Permits needed for the morning.  Attend Refinery Supers meeting.  Do permit audits and oversee the days work.  Turn in daily log, make relief."
good,"Like all companies, Exxon has good and poor management. Some issues with being managed by a manger in another country since locals get preferential treatment."
good,"Fast paced, environment, with lots of opportunities to learn, grow and produce high quality results. "
good,"I am currently a contractor in the Global Marine Services department.  However, I am currently pursing my BS in Business Administration with a specialization in Human Resources. I would like to continue my career if possible in the Human Resources field."
good,"The Exxon that I worked for was a family owned business, loved them, no issues. Didn't deal directly with Exxon so I cant speak to them personally...."
good,Keep u busy great intepactiom close relatiomship with locals. Good training patient helpfvl managdment. Make life time relatïonshhp. Fresh fôod everyone hejps oup amd does their part
good,"Very nice place to work, but still a big corporation, so the job can be very routine."
good,"Jobs like this are a Dying Breed unfortunately in this country, was supposed to be my career to enjoy up to retirement age but was short-lived after Exxon merged with Mobil,  the company decided they no longer wanted two risk delivering product so they slowly started Outsourcing the deliveries."
good,"I didn't realize how oppressive it was until I left. I'm paid 3% less now, but I am happier. Great benefits. Golden Handcuffs."
good,"Os dias variam entre bastante corridos e dias calmos, salários um pouco abaixo do mercado, política de avaliação de funcionários precisa ser revista, muitos setores sem metas claras."
good,"This was my first job and I was enjoying working with the Exxon on the run store was amazing clean and nice, very friendly environment to work."
good,It was too long ago for me to give a solid opinion. I was part of an internship program in the commercial contract area 11 years ago.
good,Strong company with significant industry clout.  Significant gap between highly experienced and new to the industry staff which creates a concern for future employee experience within the workplace.
good,"Meeting new People Everyday. Satisfying Customer needs, Excited to be on the Job, Management is Fair and Caring a lot for the Employees, Flexible Schedules, Co-workers are great and fun to be Work with."
good,Very nice and comfortable office surroundings. High profile company.
good,"Pumping gas, dealing with money and customers, co-workers were OK. Meeting new people while working."
good,Helped customers on everyday basis. Enjoyed computing sales and keeping track of + percentages.
good,"I enjoyed working at this gas station. It tought me how to work with a more ""tougher"" customer base than what I was used to, but I adapted well."
good,Great pay but expect to work long hours if you want to be successful. Just wish it was a better work life balance. The culture is work hard and everything else comes second. Learned alot through my experience
good,ExxonMobil is a large company so change is difficult.  They hire one type of person and if you don't fit in their mold you will not advance.  The only thing keeping most people there is the pay/pension and job security.
good,"at the time that i work there i was 18-19 years old, it was a fun place to work as a teenager. the hours were great most of my co-workers were fun to be around."
good,The benefits are great but the company seems to divide its employees by how much education you may have or by your job role. The company has different benefits for employees who are union represented then company employees which seem unfair
good,"A typical day at work I spent cashiering, stocking, and keeping the store clean and safe for customers. The management wasn't very professional. Dealing with that was the hardest part of my job. I enjoyed the customers the most! I grew close to them and even made a few new friends."
good,"Working for Exxon has helped me learn excellent customer service and cash handling skills. We get hundreds of customers per day, so usually the day goes by fast. As a cashier I get to interact with diverse customers."
good,"Compensation and benefits have been great during the good times, but are slowing due to commodity prices. Recognition at the top that culture needs to change, but perceived by most that it is lip service only and no real change happening at mid-management levels."
good,To use parallel processing and scheduling are the two hardest part for me . but i did it because of suportive co-workers And supportive mgt.
good,"My job is very simple, I inspect cars and 18 wheeler's for contraband  going in and out the refinery. My co-workers are very nice and friendly. Over all it is a nice job to have."
good,"As a manager for a team of records advisors, my daily responsibilites are responding to request, providing team with client list and needs. Updating SharePoint site with new policies, work items and office support documenation. Gather documentation for status, risk and client needs to ensure managment staff members are informed, this provides all of the financial obligations needed for organization. Answer client questions, concerns, support team efforts and abiities. Provide training as needed."
good,The entrance in office changes according to the shifts and the tasks of the day (from 6 am to 11:30 am). I learned how to handle with stressing situations focusing only on the targets requested. Relation with management is professional and respectful as well as with colleagues. The hardest part of the job is the amount of hours necessary to accomplish all the daily tasks and the time available for problem solving (short)
good,A typical day at work was always a fast paced and good day. I learned new skills such as drill work and laying of concrete.
good,"Great location if you want to constantly be busy, but the customer demographic local to the area can be quite difficult to deal with. The management staff keeps a well run store and station, but no opportunity for advancement leaves a lot to be desired."
good,Challenging work environment . Some of the challenges are the remoteness of the field and work groups within the process. There is a lot to be learned at this location.
good,Working for Exxon was different. They were a large company when times you could get lost between the shuffle but with hard work and dedication you were able to be noticed and get the job done.
good,"It is a company with very good starting benefits, but the career is too slow and ""long-term"" so opportunities and promotions take a long time to develop."
good,"A typical day at Exxon consist of a lot of stocking,you see a lot of the same people every day its really an interesting place to work, its extremely safe."
good,I learned how to handle hostial situations. And I also learned how to be a people person. I'm very good at what I do. I stocked everything and was also front cashier.
good,Training and certified in many skill sets which make me valuable for any company.  Have work experience in many different cultures and possess the ability to adapt in any environment to get work complete.
good,"I held a Cashier position. It was both fun and challenging. I had hundreds of regulars I came in contact with on the regular basis. I dealt with cash transactions as well as credit card, debit, check and voucher transactions. This job consisted of stocking coolers, and other items as required. I dealt with many food vendors regularly and I had to complete paperwork after every shift. my Co-workers were the best, I didn't care for management or the way in which they operated at times, however it did not effect my work or work ethic. the Hardest part about the job was dealing with the tailgating crowds due to the fact that we were directly across the street from Southern Miss. The most enjoyable part was being able to multitask- perform all of the duties required of me while interacting with the public."
good,"ExxonMobil is a great place to work, We had great benefits. I worked for more than 10 years. I had the opportunity to learn a lot of skills.  I was supporting 3 executives, 10 direct reports total of 30 people.  The hardest part of the job to support 30 people, very busy job, I was handling payroll of 30 people, international/domestic travel arrangements for executives, scheduled meetings with high level managements.  Some days I had to stay late, worked long hours but no overtime.  The job was very busy and crazy but the coworkers were very nice.  I had a wonderful relationship with some coworkers. The most enjoyable of the job that we had the opportunity to go to a lot of events, had so many friends."
good,"plenty of work, constantly on the move and expected to achieve the overall job task, management was a little sloppy, the hardest part of the job was to cover a lot of work in so little time, and the best part is that people counted on me to help out with the production and gave me a satisfaction that I was looked to achieve great things."
good,Exxon was a good company to work for I just got sick of working 80-100 per week and wanted more family time.
good,Working for Exxonmobil the day is spent assisting customers with food and beverages while providing a pleasant a shopping experience. During my time working for Exxonmobil I've learned the value of creating a unique shopping experience for customers by providing the best customer service in a timely fashion thus increasing customer retention. Management at Exxonmobil is strict but seek to improve the work habits of all employees and most certainly lead by example. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult situations and managing that situation in the calmest and most professional fashion thus avoiding confrontation between employees and customers. The most enjoyable aspect of being an employee at Exxon Mobil is enjoying all the delicious coffee you can ask for and working with a great sales team!
good,I enjoyed working at Exxonmobil because they have a balance for life after work.
good,"At first it was tough but once I got used to it, it was very easy. I worked so well and gained lots of experience and got to meet different kind of people."
good,Itl had really good managers. The bosses were very fair and leniant. The work was pretty easy and was able to do at your own pace. Had to have good basic math skills.
good,"You will be a small drop in an oversized ocean. You will be one small employee in an oversized organization. The culture is old-fashioned and pretty slow. This is a place to sit in one job for 30 years until you retire, not a place for expansion or growth."
good,"Great environment,not very organised though, managers not organising staff breaks properly. procedure's changing from different sites"
good,"Good company, but very rigid. Great work-life balance with pretty good comp. However, finance is more accounting in nature and you have little control over your career path."
good,"Eine Arbeit muß sozial verträglich sein, eine gute Altersvorsorge beinhalten und eine erträgliche Fahrzeit gewärleisten."
good,"performed automotive diagnostic analysis, as well as repair and maintenance work. Suggestive sold maintenance products to customers. I learned the value of a hard days work and that hard work and effort pays off in the end. I also learned that top notch customer service is key in creating satisfied customers that will turn into valued repeat customers for the business. I worked with individuals of all sorts of different backgrounds and ideas, this certainly taught me the value of team work, getting along with others and diversity. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, but I always put in the time and effort required of me to accomplish my days tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of creating satisfied customers and seeing people leave with a smile."
good,Managerment Needed worked on Emplyees Lazy Sometimes or come in Late. Customers Greatly wonderful to Help.Management Needed retraining In there Field and Emplyees needed to come in on time
good,busy store but owner was unfair. i was over payed because of previous owner but he was a great person. other than that i enjoyed it because i stayed to myself due to working overnight.
good,Ergonomic work environment
good,"I miss working for XOM, had they not moved to Houston I would still work for the company.  Although I complained (but who doesn't complain about their job) I still enjoyed the perks."
good,You get raises in a short span. I was one of the hardest workers there.
good,Rang up customers items. met a lot of different cultures while I was there and a lot of unfriendly managers. it was the hardest.
good,It is a gud place to work and easy stocking working on register dealing with customers the manager are good to work with a good invirment we clean are area
good,"Working overnight is extremely difficult and hard on the social life, but I got paid well for what little I did. The management was horrible and unforgiving."
good,The job was nice and relax. But that was a job that was boring to me. I don't like sitting around with nothing to do.
good,"I was a trainer, cook, cashier, and a problem solver which was typical everyday because some believe if you do not get paid for it why do it. I enjoy helping so why not take the opportunity to make someone's day brighter. I met a lot of interesting people, we were on I-35 (the highway from hell) always busy never lacked in service or anything other. I got a long with most both management and workers but the challenging part was trying to please everyone which we all know is impossible especially when attitudes flare and sales are refused. Texas tolerates no errors especially when it comes to beer and tobacco procedures-no means not this time, meaning your thoughts are off and I am here to ensure you get home safe no matter what the other cashiers do. I am me and I follow rules they are there for a reason."
good,I am a contractor so it wouldn’t to much make a difference in how Does ExxonMobil really works. But I know from being out here around Exxinmibil they treats you no different. But it’s jus our sorry company we work work for through exxonmobil.
good,"It was overall a fun job. It was an Exxon Baskin Robbins mix so ice-cream runs were the name of the game. Learning to make new and interesting dessert combinations was certainly one of the more enjoyable aspects of the job. As the only one on overnight staff multitasking took on new and exciting meaning, customer satisfaction being the number one goal."
good,Would recommend this for someone in highschool but not for someone who is needing full time hours. This job doesnt offer a constant schedule so you never know what days youre workimg until sunday of the week before
good,I stayed. Busy but low on pay scale and worked to many hours for part time and doesn't offer good benefits and not very good hours but manger was nice
good,I learned while I was employed with the company that in retail that inventory control and management is very critical. I also gain knowledge about handling and keeping count of big sums of money. A average work day consisted of a checklist of duties that were to be completed upon every shift so it was basically same duties in routinely manner.
good,usually bagging ice and stocking coolers. hardest part of the job was when we got busy co workers always called in and left me working most of the time
good,"It was great, I had a decent amount of hours. The shifts were usually the same. Everyone that worked there at the time was friendly and easy to get along with. Management wasn’t the greatest."
good,Good place to work but no room for advancement. The management wasn't allows on time. Had to work past myschedule shifts due to unorganized scheduling.
good,"cash register duties.  Count drawer, and clean up at end of shift. Sales to help other kids.  Check the gas pumps.  Make sure parking lot was clean of trash.  Change trash bags deside the gas pumps."
good,"My short time at Exxon was stressful, un-professional, too much drama and chaos, Too many bosses and no direction. They violated my HIPPA and rights to privacy act. The General Manager set a horrible example for employees to follow. Over-all experience was very un-professional enviroment."
good,Teaching at-risk teens was very trying and risky.  I loved the return students years later who said I changed them & brought their families by to meet me.
good,"The job itself is great. Easy enough to get everything done, as long as the truck order has been done right, witch is too often not done right. As for the employees, they are all very nice. As for the way the store is managed, it could be done better. When you can't take a sick day because nobody wants to ever cover. When I am throwing up all night long in the store in front  of costomers, I feel the it's the managers job to make sure things like that don't happen. And then while we are already short staff as it is, half of them have gone on vacation this week. Leaving 2 employee's working everyday occasionally pulling doubles when others are unable to work their time or don't show."
good,Mobil is an easy gas station job. Tasking is set and not extremely straining. As long as you can help customers and take care of the gas pumps and sales its a good job to have.
good,"good place to work lot of advancement strong company good management nice people opportunity for travel and advancement"
good,slow and boring at times. its connected to a Whataburger so that is convenient for food. bunch of regular customers which I really do enjoy. only thing I don't like is no raises or career advancement.
good,A typical day consisted of stocking drinks and straightening up merchandise as well as clean when not busy with customers. Also kept coffee made. and cigarettes stocked.
good,"Very fast paced, good employees to work with. Must be motivated to stay there. Must like working with the public, and have a lot of patience with customers."
good,didnt work around my hours i could work would not change my hours of work that i could and couldnt not good at allowing the days you ask for off. manager did not help with any work that needed to be done and you had to be talked to about what you couldnt get done by yourself. if you didnt get something done everthing fell on me when nobody else did their jobs i had to go over everyones side work and do twice what i had to do because nobody else did theirs or else i would get in trouble. very stressful when nobody does their jobs and others have to go and do it for them. there were only two of us that did anything and if we didnt we would get yelled at by everyone else because they actually had to work and bosses would do nothing about it.
good,"The workload was too much,as I was handling all the work load of all persons in my department. Good place for enhancing your skills and they give good training opportunities within the organisation. Management is not friendly and supportive as too much politics within the company. Good Ergonomics Place as its very important for Exxon for their employees"
good,"Looking for the opportunity to develop and improve ,myself, looking to be given the opportunity to develop within an organisation, looking for an organisation that will enable me to apply my skills and continue learning"
good,Has provided good learning on some issues and has strengthened my knowledge in project management with good analytical mind of solving problems encountered during project execution. co-workers has being very cooperative at helping to resolve issues especially safety concerns. overall the job has being interesting without any part of it seen as hard or difficult. Every part of the job has being really interesting and enjoyable.
good,"Long hours due to lack of employees, no job advancement. Management was a nightmare to work for, I have been a manager at other convenient stores and when I tried to input on how we should do paperwork in order to find where mistakes were being made then I was told that they would do it there way."
good,Expect to much an don’t wanna pay management stay with attitude cuz she bitter about a man  just to much can’t keep no mangers at all need improvement
good,"Overall environment is ok. Area around location, and local patrons overall decent. Rude and belligerent customers as well. Management in store was acceptable."
good,worked for Qatargas from 2005 to 2018 in Qatar. great experience and exposed to most challenges in the oil and gas industry. serviced in many departments
good,"This job taught me some good work ethics, had good customers also. The job had allowed me to get more skills for future jobs such as, people skills, organizational skills."
good,"As long as you do your job correctly, it is a great place to work for. I loved my work environment and who I worked with. But when my mother got sick, and had to deal with her cancer after my step dad unexpectedly passed, they did not want to work with me. I don't blame the company. I believe it was just the manager of the store"
good,It is a great place to work.. Not a competitive place to work.. Managment and team are great people to work with... Great for people who want a part time and need the extra income.. Not great if yoy need a job for livinging..
good,"Large separation between company employees and contractors, makes for some uncomfortable situations.  Sometimes difficulty to feel as part of a team.."
good,I really didn't have a lot to do with Exxon . There name was on my gas station and that's about it. The roof leaked on the pumps when it rained. They promised to fix but never did.
good,Working at mobil was a good job but ultimately is not a great place for a career. I felt underpaid at the location I was working at. My bosses were good but I felt that they could have managed the employees a bit better. Hours varried either by seniority or who they liked more which usually came down to what gender you identified as. I enjoyed how laid back you could be with the customers who liked you the most. There would be stressful times but the good weighs evenly with the bad. I will always recognize that it was one of my major stepping stones.
good,When I worked for this company I thought it was a great opportunity to get my foot in the door for a Oil and Gas company. I only worked in a file room so I did not get much exposure to other aspects of the company. The department I was in was outsourced and I was not able to say after the transition.
good,ExxonMobil is a good company to work for. The biggest issue I have with the company is stressful environment and competitive nature of the work place.
good,Was dealing with the customer and working by yourself and getting all your duties done before your shift is over with and having to use the restroom in between customers.
good,Working at he gas station was fun meet a lot of great people but it's also a very dangerous job. A typical day at work would go very smoothly. The stock truck would come around 11am-1pm.
good,"Fair Management. A lot of hours. Paid overtime. Closed on Holidays.Generally work 8 hours per shift. Only one Co worker. Responsible for customer service, also daily, weekly and monthly paperwork. Weekly inventory. Ordering and receiving product. Stocking, cleaning, pricing."
good,"i really liked the people and the work, its not that bad i cant complain nor will i publicly discredit a company. every job has its ups and downs and a company is only as strong as its weakest employee. team work is important and coming together to meet the challenges of the day in the work place to make it productive and great for all!"
good,"Exxon Mobil is a good company to work for to make a lot of money. They pay very well and there benefits are average. However, they have a great safety program that is not working well. They have an excessive number of managers and a low number of field workers. This creates an unsafe environment because the field people, who are the most at risk, are being rushed and overworked in areas where safety is of utmost importance. Field worker are required to work an enormous amount of mandatory overtime with irregular hours and no scheduled breaks."
good,"If your working a 9-5 job this a decent job, but very unrewarding. It's a job to pay bills and what not. The people you work with will are fine and the management is decent. The hardest part of the job is when it is extremely busy and ringing up products continuously for hours upon hours. It is enjoyable, but a person must always look busy."
good,I had dealt with many customers while completing other tasks. There was a hard par of this job. The thing I enjoyed most was working with the customers.
good,"I learned so much at this position. Tracking sales, inventory, revenue and the art of promotion. This is one of those dream jobs that everyone should be so lucky to have."
good,"Busy mornings, customer friendly, learned lottery and gas pumps necessities, learned management skills (training), hardest part was being energized early in the morning for the sake of customers, most enjoyable part was turning a customers day around and even the customers turning mine around."
good,Management favored a lot. the store manager is amazing to work with and very understanding. Work was what you would expect from working at a gas station
good,Working for ExxonMobil was not a hard job. It is a lot of physical work and you have to keep in mind the hazards and cautions that come with working around gasoline.
good,"Great onboarding."
good,A decent job and quite relaxing however your experience as an employee there depends heavily upon the store managers integrity. I was licky enough to wind up with an awesome manager and together we made sure that store had a rating of 100 on every inspection. However most stores are lucky to pull 60
good,The work environment went downhill under new bosses. They began short-handing staff and cutting hours so they can pay themselves more. Quality of work was not monitored well either.
good,"the overall experience at exxon mobile was fair.i worked third shift so it wasn't very busy so I spent most of my time doing detail cleaning such as windows or walls,sweeping parking lot,cleaning gas pumps,restocking shelves and counting inventory."
good,"Normally I would clock in, check all the coolers and make sure they are fronted and faced forward."
good,"Night shift is a fast paced work environment, we are the behind the scenes people who get our store ready for the next day, for our awesome costumers!"
good,Lots of duties to keep you busy. Learn new skills. Learn how to manage your time. Clean work place. Mornings and lunch rushes can get tense. You must be fast and hard working to work here.
good,"I really had a connection with all of my clients and they made me want to stick around. Our compensation was poor, and when I wanted to discuss PTO in accordance with contract I was told I was given the wrong contract to sign so it doesn't count. Just FYI this was a personal training job at ExxonMobil through Optum."
good,Not paid enough for the work you do. Job is stressful. No room for advancement. But the bosses are great. No benifits. However you meet a lot of people. It's fast paced because it's always busy.
good,It is a little hard to balance a social life and a work life while working for Exxon. You basically are on call always. But it is over all a great work experience. You really gain a lot from this job.
good,"This job was everything you would expect while working at a gas station. Opening and closing, cash handling,  general store maintenance, customer service. The management and family that ran the business were helpful and kind."
good,"This company unfortunately continues to allow the existence of the good ole boy network to thrive in 2017. There is upward mobility only if you are a part of this network, if not you will find the going very tough."
good,"Mostly handle cashier, stock taking, and customers. Some place the supervisor are rude and won't even release the staff even when they already shown sign of sickness."
good,Most days started off with me preparing breakfast and prepping lunch. We open at 5 am so its my job to make sure the box is full and ready for customers. One thing I love about my job is the positive feedback I get from customers and management. I wouldn't be able to be a successful as I am in the field if it wasn't for that criticism. The hardest thing to deal with at my job is knowing that I have to leave eventually. I look forward to showing my knowledge and skills with my future company
good,"Overall the company is a good place to work. The company culture and work life balance is ideal.  However, specific managers are not skilled or experienced to manage  people or projects."
good,"Excellent benefits for direct hire employees, hours are normal day business hours for all members of the Desktop support team. Lunch hour is available for all employees, they have a cafeteria that is open from 7:00 am till 2:00 pm, Monday thru Friday."
good,"Sigh to work and count your register. "
good,"a nice place to work, morning shift stocker,the co-workers was good"
good,I handeled money stock coolers cleaned and did a lot of customer service.
good,I learned how to work and deal with various people and under various conditions. I enjoyed meeting new people and forming great relationsips with my frequent customers. The hardest part of the job was having ugly customers but I learned how to handle them. 
good,This was an awesome job opportunity that taught me maturity and the importance of establishing a professional working rapport with co-workers and management. It's also where I first began to utilize my skills in excel due to the various charts and schedules that I was required to make.
good,It was more fast paced. Co-workers were great to work with nd customers were excellent. Progression was a little slow but it was possible.
good,"My time at the Exxon was good, some difficult days as at any work place made me a great problem solver and how to work around different personalities."
good,I had a great experience working there. Customers have a different cense of manors in AR. I hated having to Leave. I was a cashier in real time. My manager loved me cause I clean when I don't have anything to do. The owner loved me cause I did maintenance on things that saved him money.
good,"Too much work and not enough pay. hours aren't set and management is terrible and lazy, there is no set schedule so its always changing and at the last minute"
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"working at Exxon mobile was definitely an experience to remember, the customers and coworkers were great people to be around. they made it a very friendly working environment and made work fun. counting lottery and cigarettes had to be the most demanding wok task but was very simple for the most part."
good,"Job was easy. Run cash, lottery during certain times, stock and clean. Graveyard shift, you get some crazies every once in awhile but if you’re know to put out coffee, cops will stop by to check on you regularly; they’re pretty much your only customers besides truckers."
good,First job I can say I kind of enjoyed working on I used to work overnight the pay is excellent better than South Carolina and more options Wendy's is next door so food is close and u meet all kinds of people
good,"If I could change anything would that they would give people a proper break mandatory by law if you work more than 8 hours you get a 30 minute lunch but not here you have to wait until there is no one in the store to run to the bathroom and hope no one walks in, it would be nice if an employee is doing great after x amount of time there give them a raise."
good,"A typical day at work is mostly interesting, attending meetings and doing the core job. ExxonMobil is a good training ground for any employee who is ready to learn and persevere, The workplace culture is world class standard as well as a conducive environment for work. So much emphasis on safety and getting the job done right at all time.  There's always this culture of working under pressure for goals to be met. This is because one usually has little time to prepare and deliver."
good,"A very decent place to work. Lots of hours and opportunity for overtime. Management needs a bit of work but otherwise, if you are hired here you will be here for a long period of time before job hunting else where."
good,"ExxonMobil was like a university for me, I learned more here then in any other wor place. It is a very structured company where everything is already written down, leaves small space for innovation. "
good,"My experience working there has been learning. I have had to professionalize in customer service, learn to work at a quick flow of customers so a stressful or fast pace environment. Inventory management and reconcile of cash flow."
good,I loved the customers and the job itself. I had to relocate so I had to quit. I really enjoyed the job. I would like to find another job like this one.
good,"Expected to work Excessive hours, lacking in development culture, too many high.y paid chiefs resulting heavy overhead. In turn operated in the red and the closing of the corporate store division."
good,You get to me almost every single type of person. You have to deal with every single person and there attitudes. Everyone is different and you have to be nice and kind to each one even when they annoy you.
good,Pays well.  Overall culture is too policy and process driven.  Takes forever to get anything done due to the size of the company and the policies and processes to navigate to get the simples of tasks completed.
good,"I was responsible for opening the site before 6am. Security checks would have to be carried out before opening. Days involved serving customers and ensuring staff were fulfilling their duties. Also collating all paperwork and monies from the previous shift ready for G4S. Ensuring the site was clean, tidy and safe at all times for staff and customers. Maintaining the stock levels whilst double checking rotation of dates. Ordering sufficient stock to a time and date schedule to make sure the necessary items were available for both the customer and the promotions which were regularly inspected without warning. Accepting delivery of both produce and fuel, adhering to Health and Safety requirements at all times. I loved the fact that I never knew what challenge I would experience from day to day and it made me think on my feet but I enjoyed finding a solution. My favourite part of the job was interacting with the customers and I met lots of lovely people who returned again and again due to the service they received. The hardest part would be stocktaking in either extreme heat or freezing cold."
good,I started out as a cashier at this job & 3 years later received the honor to be a manager. I was sent to management classes provided by my company to educate me on how to handle different types of issues I may encounter as a manager. I loved working for the owner that ran this particular store. He was fair in rewarding hard workers. This is where I learned to really deal with public face to face & became strong in my communication skills. I enjoyed my job  here at this Mobil .
good,Enjoy with the rem workers and we as like family in there.I learned t team work in there and hope using for any new job.Also integrity was there because  the treatment was very good
good,Go in at either 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. Learned various laboratory tests. Management is very friendly. workplace culture - everyone is hardworking and easy to work with
good,Salary and benefits are great.  There lots of committees and projects that are going on to help you develop.  They expect a lot from you and encourage you to go above and beyond.  Lots of pressure to meet targets and become overwhelming and unrealistic.
good,"before starting work in this kind of place where i work seems very easy but when when you get inn you realize its crazy a lot of work have to do,but everything is good when you start working"
good,"Great company to work for, nice people but tough on family life. I wish work culture can be relaxed a little for family commitments."
good,"good fair management run the cash register stock shelfs clean in and out of store,while people come in and out. cook food for custamers run lotto and stay busy."
good,"The job isn't bad if you can deal with heat, but the bosses are completely hypocritical and play favorites to a farther extent than I've ever seen."
good,A typical day at work is pretty laid back and productive. I learn that different customers have different vibes and learn how to satisfy them with giving them the best customer service skills I have. My managers are really good people and understanding. I enjoy my coworkers and the hardest part is not being able to evolve in the company and I want to be able to excel.
good,main store manager had double standards. there was a lot of drama between other co workers. it is not a company id work for again
good,"A typical day at the gas station was for me to clock in, make fresh coffee for the customers when the come in. Then i counted my drawer, and stocked any new shippers that came in. I learned how to count  products as far as cigerattes and separate new and old items. My co-workers were ok but most of the time i worked alone. The hardest part of this job was not knowing things and being there alone having to find things on my own. The most enjoyable part was making people happy and meeting new people."
good,i would go to work and enjoy who i work with and my manager was the best and we together and get all of the work done and had fun doing it.
good,"A very challenging job. Most of the staff are all senior staff. I have learned about how to manage a group of senior staff, operation, safety and sales revenue of the station. The most enjoyable part of the job are meeting a lot of different people."
good,Putting up with different people arguments and challenges. But im a strong minded person and I worked there for 4 years and loved it.
good,got to know the community as well as multiple duties to stay busy

good,I learned money handling skills and how to complete transactions
good,"Operations... what else can describe it! Running the systems, processes and job queues."
good,"Checking out customers and keeping up the stores appearence, Loves my manager, nice co-workers, stressful at times,"
good,"great retail and customer service training,management do there job well fun-loving enviormental status your learning more and more every day"
good,"I was a cashier at a high volume gas station. I work alot of over time and work 2nd shift. Then i moved to 3rd shift and loved it even more. I would make coffee and hot dogs, cleaned, stock shelves, inventory and aduits. Also make sure the trucks brought all inventory that was on my ordering sheet. I was also a safty captain."
good,*A average day of work was assisting customers and cleaning the store.
good,A typical day was working on the register and stocking the cooler and cleaning the store. I learned how to conduct inventory. Management had a few issues. Never acknowledging my hard work for the company. Hardest part was stocking 30-packs all day. Most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Exxon"
good,"Process operator, with lots of overtime and high stress job, work 12 hour shifts in all kinds of weather and hazzards , great in working in teams and with people"
good,When I worked here they had been a much smaller franchise Mobil. It had been dirty and not up to par. They recently renovated the place and it is way nicer and much bigger.
good,"They worked with me when I needed certain days off or wasnt able to stay long on my shift. Always have a huge variety of goods, including food, alcohol and the best hot food possible, but must go on 3rd shift"
good,I enjoyed working for Exxon Mobil . In the field of work most task are met with the proper equipment . It was a good work experience for me. My co workers were all hard working.
good,"You have to do certain tasks depending upon your schedule.  It can be cleaning the restrooms, stoking the store, taking the trash out,  cleaning the shope..."
good,"Pretty bad honestly, but that’s mainly due to the hopelessly outdated little box that is the mobil station. Cold in the winter, hot in the summer. What’s not to love?"
good,"As long as you were willing to sacrifice a little social life, it was definitely worth it. The shift pattern was challenging but there was plenty of scheduled leave to help recover."
good,"Good Work Environment and Culture."
good,It was enjoyable work at times other times I didnt feel safe cause the other co workers were drug users I worked inside the store and outside the store shoveling snow taking care of gas pumps cleaning parking lot stocking shelfs.
good,"Counting out drawers, making count of inventory, cigarettes making coffee in morning. The hardest would be lunch making sure pizzas, sandwiches, taking orders, if by yourself or not train proper way to someone that is new. The most enjoyable part would be a customer that is happy to see u or someone’s that appreciate the time and duty u do in your job."
good,"As a contractor, one of the better, more forward-thinking places to work - depending on your team. They have tech struggles, but they have work arounds. The location is great and the environment is nice."
good,"I worked there on as a contract employee. I did not have the benefits as a full time worker did.  It was a great job, I worked with a very talented agency to produce incredible marketing communication pieces."
good,"Good Company, International environment, young environment, work life balance company, good place to start your career of course, good location in Prague 5."
good,"Scheduling could have been better, and management could have handled no call no show better with proper action.  The work environment was great all employees worked together collectively majority of the time."
good,"Working for Mobil was an overall okay experience, there was not much room for advancement to become a member or management. The managers were friendly."
good,"Clock in, and start working. As I would stock costumers would come in so it would be a spread out job. Always something to do from stocking the cooler to helping on the cash register when busy in the store."
good,"- Very busy/ Learn a lot from project after prpject."
good,ExxonMobil construction was a good company to work for a talk to a lot of things tricks and trades on the job to help you farther alone and Millwork / carpenter work only thing I will say little bad thing will be it's the fact is you're not hiring on with the construction company when the job is finished they basically lay you off so it's really no job security
good,Exxon gave me the ability to improve my skills as a leader while giving me an environment of wanting to get stuff done.  Daily tasks were laid out very straightforward and workplace culture allowed us to complete them at our own pace.  Management was easy to communicate with.
good,The day to day task was ever changing to provide you with all accountable office skills. Interacting with any and all kinds of other co-workers to gain comfort.
good,"Good environment, safety is a primary concern and responsibility, work load is realistic, chemist and managers are able to answer any questions or concerns in a timely manner"
good,"Working any shift could be very busy, but the time goes faster that way. The salary wasnt the greatest but there is always overtime. The staff is usually friendly as well."
good,this job is good for people with good customer service skills who enjoys working with people. i learned alot on how to manage time and how to get through busy hours without panic. my favorite part of the job is to meet new people.
good,It was fun but the manager was simple . I enjoyed working there but I had to leave because some of the people . I recommend people to work there but just watch the People there
good,"This company - ExxonMobil does not not change much over time, all business processes are very stable. Career track at ExxonMobil is typical. Career growth is slow."
good,"As the title says, it's been a long time.  From what I can remember, it was a great place to work, just definitely felt like a number!  Things might have changed since then."
good,Is a great job with my old manager I really enjoyed it and I don't lot of responsibilities and things to do I always felt like I kept busy and was treated fairly when they switch management the new manager did not want to work did not treat employees fairly and had no respect for any customer
good,"XOM is a great place to work if you are single and looking to make money. There is tons of mandatory OT and you’ll be working swing shift. You’ll be making six figures by your second year. However, if you have family, you will rarely see them. You’ll be at work on nights and weekends. You wont have a great family life"
good,If you did your job properly there they didn't mind too much if I took a break often.  If the work is done they are happy. at least when I worked there.
good,Fast paced customer service based consist of alot numbers and must also be good with face to Dave encounters while doing exchange for goods overall a simple job
good,"easy job will get busy somedays. pay not to good, but if you get inspector license you get raise and 50 cents for each car you do. managment is laid back as long as tasks are taken care of"
good,"Great place to work for as far as ownership. Fun environment, decent workplace and home/life balance. Management needs a little work. Shows a little bit of favoritism."
good,Working at an Exxon Plant is similar to any other plants.  One unique aspect is the strict policy concerning safety at an ExxonMobil Plant.  I am currently trying to work there again.
good,It was a ok places. But I want more then 7.25 and I wish there work with the hrs. Because I was on school. I wish there treat their employees better. But yea.
good,Exxon is a gas station that is overall a wonderful place. It gets quite busy and requires steady time on your feet and a steady job. In order to work there you must be a people person to deal with the public.
good,"It was a rewarding experience in the sense that I got to be in touch with different people and perceive the joys and sorrows of a small town.  This,  for my anthropological imagination was a great opportunity.  As a student it gave me the opportunity to help pay for my studies and I will always be grateful for that."
good,The company is built with large project teams and you are able to learn both great technical and execution aspects. In some groups you are able to switch positions every few years to allow continuous growth. .
good,This has to be one of my favorite jobs that I have worked for. Minimum wage was the pay but I always would work 32 hours plus a week which helped me pay my bills and have a little extra. The management was excellent never had any problems and if I could go back and work there I would.
good,Nice place to learn and grow in terms of new tools and technologies. Management don't hesitate to bring in new technolgies that helps in the growth of the employees and the company as well
good,A typical day at work involved being out in the climate gauging barges and field tanks. Being in this field I was able to pick up on how operations are ran throughout the plant. You also get to learn about different products and how to deal with them when gauging and sampling. Management started off pretty good until there was a change that cause a lack in communication. Hardest part of the job was just facing different climate conditions but once you get used to it becomes easier. The most enjoyable part of this job is the down time you get when loading or discharging of cargos are going correctly.
good,"Opened and closed the store, cleaning the store, stocking shelves when needed as well as drink coolers. was a really great company to work for. Hours was great"
good,Overall a good company to work for .It has it's challenges like any other company..Not much of a chance for any advancement once you become a lease operator..Outdoor work in weather conditions are a challenge to deal with especially during winter months..You must be a self starter with miminal supervision which I like..
good,"A typical day involved interactions with  all managerial levels, clients and outside resources such as attorneys and experts.  It was fast paced, with a lot of responsibility,"
good,"The folks at ExxonMobil hire some exceptional people, and they expect them to do exceptionally good work.  If you're up to the task, it's worth the effort and the reward."

good,"I would typically clock in and then count the cash register I was assigned to that day, and then cash out customers as they came in either for gas, cigarettes (or anything behind the counter like lottery tickets, cigars, etc), or any other merchandise we sold in the store. I would assist anyone who needed help at the gas pumps outside, swept the outside lot as well as maintained the floors inside. I made sure the hot dogs and coffee were changed in a timely fashion, wiped down all counters and general maintenance of the store. My coworkers were fun to be around, management was nice and fair. Hardest part of the job was making sure the customers were happy, especially when the gas pumps makes them lose their money.

My manager was very well trained and was very easy to get along with. I really enjoyed her company and miss her a lot. My co-workers were excellent. There would be times where I would have to cover their slack but that comes with any job you get if you have lazy people working.

good,"This was a great place to begin my career in Intelligence Analysis. Once you mastered the majority of your job, there was little to challenge you and little opportunity for advancement other than salary. The job to an extent is what you make of it. Since I left, analysts now apparently have the opportunity to move up to other series like Program Manager/Security Manager. So that is a positive outcome."
good,It's a wonderful first job to have. It's even a good job to have on the side if you are looking for extra money. The work environment is okay if you enjoy people and provide good customer service

It should also get rid of several old-school management who do not help get things moving."

good,"My typical day started at 6 -6:15 each AM."
good,Work as a cashier at Exxon is a fast pace job. I have people frequently in and out the store. It is a neighbor gas station so I most of the time see the same people everyday. I recognize and know most of my customers by face and even name. Exxon is the first and only gas station I have ever experience and it has been a challenging job. I have had to tell with several thieves trying to still items out of the store. It is an interesting job but it also keep you occupied.
good,I met so many different people that were willing to tell me many of their flaws to try to guide me to the right path. This job made me so mature at a pretty young age. It taught me hard work and dedication.

good,Typical day at Exxon/SGS Petroleum Service of consisted mostly of loading wax rail cars and trucks. I was a rover and would go from rack to rack to do various jobs since I was qualified in different areas. The hardest part was never getting step up pay since it wasnt in the budget.
good,"Good Experience, good people, good job learned a lot. they have alot of old and new mixed in on the instrutments so it brings back some learning lessons."
good,"On a typical day I will negotiate with suppliers, coordinate with internal clients and manage the purchasing of services and materials for production operations in Iraq.  I have developed negotiations techniques, communication skills to manage complex relationships with international supplier and clients and many of the nuances of the supply chain and procurement process.  Most employees in my group have been with the company for at least 15 years and are very knowledgable in the area of procurement.  The hardest part of my job is maintaining constant communication with contractors and clients in Dubai and Prague, mostly due to time differences and travel distance.  The most enjoyable part of my job is developing relationships with a diverse global team and having a direct effect on production operations."
good,I have worked a contract with the company for seven years. I am very glad to be presently working with Exxon Mobil employees.
good,I provided customer service to hundreds of customers daily. I learned how to run a convenience store by taking care of the inventory orders and making sure we have everything we needed. I managed the orders and the money that went threw the store. I would tell the owner what we needed for change and fill the safe. I had great coworkers that provided the same level of great customer service. The hardest part of the job was when the store got really busy and I had to keep up with the busy flow of customers. The thing I like most of the job was having the daily interaction with the customers.

good,Great Customer Service Experience. Working with Exxon Mobile gave me a different aspect on how customer services really work
good,Very large organisation with a globalized work environment.
good,"ExxonMobil (XOM) is a very proud organization with a good grasp in how to conduct business in the market. The business culture is very conservative, operates according to certain practices that have been in use for over 100 years, and have a mostly low threshold for risk. Recognition is dealt to individuals more often than organizations and they purposely encourage competition between employees. They want everyone to work for them for their entire careers but do not expect to have to compensate everyone as much as their competitor's. Mostly, they are a ""numbers"" company, not a ""people"" company. The most frustrating thing about XOM is their level of secrecy that is wielded as an implement by management. Many things like ranking, changes in project assignments, and future personnel moves are treated as corporate secrets. Self preservation abounds in management while self awareness is sorely in short supply."
good,"Strong culture for personal safety. Can get long streaks of OT, good or bad. Their is a culture here of work autonomy but if something were to happen then you better make sure you followed all procedures"
good,I loved that place and was there so much that the customers joked about me living in the store. It wasn't a day that didn't go by that I wasn't happy in that place. They taught me a lot about life as a young man who was on his own for the first time in life.
good,"A clean and organized policy they have. I gained some really good experience in sales and customer satisfaction, as well as inventory management and built relationships with suppliers."
good,"Working at ExxonMobil helped open doors to learn new things and the training given to me helped me get my current job. "
good,I loved working there it was just to far from home. The people were all way nice and they loved helping out as much as they could. Plus my hours fluctuated around my life schedule and this helped me go to school and work at the same time.
good,"The people and company were good, but I didnt like where I was placed. I was told the only way to secure a job was to exceed expectations and then some."
good,Exxon was such a fun environment & meeting regular customers was extremely cool! My only issue was getting paid less than everyone else & also getting the least hours. They seemed to be stingy with that.
good,"Exxon is a great company with awesome benefits. If hired in, you are probably set for life."
good,while it has its restrictions it was a fun place to work and network. and create new friends and business  potential with well connected people in the area.

good,"Walking into the Mobil for the first time was a bit of an eye opener for me. I had never worked in a gas station before. I learned the ropes of the business pretty fast. I went from being a cashier, to an asst manager in 6 months. Being an Asst. Manager taught me many life lessons. Mobil is a great place to work and there is always room for adavancement."
good,"Exxon was great, but I was a contractor, working for kelly services which is a terrible recruiting agency. I'm just so surprised why a good company like ExxonMobil hires their new employees only through Kelly?!?!?!"
good,It  individually owned and they need improved especially in security.Overall is a good company to work for you have ups and downs because of the neighborhood it is in.
good,"Working for Exxon could get stressful, but overall was a decent place to work. Management genuinely concerned about the employees and very accommodating. I would definitely work there again."

good,Typical day at work is filled with a good balance of laughter and hard work. I learn something new every day. Management supports me daily. The building is full of diversity and it's fantastic. The hardest part of the job and keeping up with the workload but it's doable. I love my colleagues.
good,"Typical day can be getting numerous paper work done by hand. Nothing was on a computer when i worked for them. Getting deposits ready for the bank if i had any to do, counting the money for are petty cash box and getting change for it. Keeping the store clean, stock, and organize. Keeping the coffee fresh."
good,"Provides and develops people to new things. Great place to work with."
good,"It was usually fairly busy, but most came in for snacks, cigarettes, beer, and gas. As it was my very first job, I learned to interact with more people than I was used to. Management was decent, though there were areas they could work on. Overall, it was a nice place to work. The hardest part of working, especially as a fresh face in any employment situation, was keeping up with everything at once by yourself. I would have to clean, stock, refill the soda fountain, brew teas several times a day, as well as keeping up with transactions throughout the day. It would get a little overwhelming, but it was the stepping stone to understand and better handle the jobs I would obtain in the future. It started my love for helping customers and making friendly conversation with new faces."
good,"Great work environment in a fast pace industry. Good opportunities to learn multiple crafts and develope working skills. Also, safety driven work culture."
good,I loved working at exxon. they are family oriented and they work with your schedule.. You feel like you belong and they treat everyone with respect. Management is always willing to help.
good,"Contract work environment well defined and structured."
good,"ExxonMobil is a great company to start the career in. The learning (training, personal development, variety of smaler or bigger projects) is unbelievable. I have learnt and tried tripple many things in comparison with the same time spent by my previous employer. You are the owner of your career, you need to look for opportunities and help your supervisor to lead you. I see this rather as an advantage. You can be part of decision making if you are active and confident. When you perform well you get a raise every year. If you don´t you don´t. The system is quite fair. Every day I am in touch with number of colleagues from CZ as well as other colleagues from all over the world. I write number of emails every day, oftern attend meetingsm teleconferences or deliver presentations or trainings. I love the people in the company, the friendly environment and team spirit are great. I get often suprised about how the company cares of its employees through number of site initiateves and educational presentations."
good,Campus is new and nice. Very upbeat and work culture is positive. Man amend was good and the benefits were good also. People that I worked with were professional and helpful.
good,"Management is focused on the wrong things... a safety ""culture"" that is not realistic to the point of managers becoming delusional about their safety ""systems.""  The culture has created the perception that you will never be able to complete anything as well as expected.. too much red tape, procedures, work permits, and processes that hinder work efficiency.  Job satisfaction is not paramount... safety meetings and process items are the driving force now.  Seems that the workload is important but yet, productivity is very lacking due to encumbrances placed on the workers by management's systems.  Bottom line is that techs are eager to ""get away"" from the office and do the actual work. Work permits and processes have killed the fun and great work atmosphere that we once enjoyed.  Projects are now done 90% by contractors... and some contract companies are passing on Exxonmobil due to cost being more than the benefit.  Most enjoyable part of working at Exxonmobil was project work where we actually got to build and start a new system, train junior employees (when time permitted), and of course working with good project Engineers."
good,"Typical day was responding to client requests, drafting complex documents, communicating with senior management, documenting work processes, and providing advice on general corporate and public relations matters."
good,"Taught me alot of things and helped advance my customer service skills. Appreciate that the manager covered for me and changed the schedule (we talked to the person being changed about it) if I was sick but didn't want to call out of my shift, or if I needed to leave early. No benefits because it was considered part time though the owner tried to ensure that all workers had 30-39 hours so they could get paid enough."
good,"ExxonMobil has strong and health policy and procedures  to manage all the process and mitigate all kinds of risk. "
good,"Very cool place to work with lots of nice amenities to enjoy. Company does look to advance with technology, but is still behind trying to catch up with its competitors. Management changes frequently in my department. Sometimes people are placed in these positions with very low leadership skills."
good,"As the Technical Analyst I provide the support coverage during Asia Pacific time zone, where all the support call will be route to my team base in Kuala Lumpur. This the beauty of the Global Support and location is different time zone. I was able to provide the support coverage for the team member in US ( different time zone by 12- 13 hours)"
good,Exxon mobil is a good place to work manger was super nice. Exxon really care about their employees great people to work with very understanding supervisors.
good,"Very safety focused, safety first, results second."
good,It is an outgoing and easy job love the employees it is a great place to work if you are looking for a first time job or have no cashier experience or just want a part time job the only issue is they need to teach and train there employees better then what I was taught .
good,"Excellent company to work for. Respects its employees. Have a good work-life balance. However, it is exposed to oil price volatility, which endangers job security for many employees."
good,"I loved working with the customers because I enjoy helping people."
good,"A typical day at work was handling customer requests via phone or email.  "
good,"Clear focused direction, with great attention to details. Target driven with an open door policy. Questions about existing processes not encouraged as belief is 125 years of experience shows sustainability"
good,"I looked forward to working on a daily basis. No day was ever the same. In the convenience store industry it's hard to keep honest and dependable employees. In order to endure and survive you definitely had to have ""thick skin""!"
good,I never knew there were so many tasks to do around a gas station/convenience store. My favorite part of the job was making new friends with the everyday friendly customers.
good,"Interação com membros da equipe e setores em várias partes do mundo. Ritmo dinâmico, necessidade de pró-atividade e adaptação a mudanças."
good,Fun community to work in. Dealing with surprises on a daily bases. Meeting new people every single day keeps me on my toes and helps me not get to comfortable with my work. We also have regulars that are a blessing and help keep me sane on days that I would rather stay home
good,Job was simple and easy to work at. Learned how to clean and stock properly. Only paid minimum wage and is a smoking environment.
good,"The Mobil gas station provides a a safe working zone in which everyone helps each other out. At Mobil you have opportunities to advance in the company. You also have to be able to keep a eye on customers while doing other tasks.  Employees must be able to clean, count money, and help customers get air for their tires and put gas in their vehicles."
good,Good recruiting and compensation. Allowed for multi views of Energy field. Would have enjoyed more opportunities to see different side of buisness. Competitive work environment.
good,"As an administrative Assistant I supported approx.15 co-workers.  Provided weekly/monthly and quarterly reports to Management and shareholders as requested.  "

good,Great place to work with great people.  ExxonMobil takes pride in their culture of safety.  I would recommend the company for anyone looking to work here.
good,Expectations were high which motivated me to work hard. Every two to three years you would be moved to a different department. This allowed to gain experience in different areas
good,"Got to Mobil 5 minutes before clocking-in. I worked two morning shift which was 6am to 2pm and two evening shift that was 2pm to 10pm. When I clocked in I make to help any customer that needed assistance. Then, I would look around and see what need to clean or stocked. I work with one other person on the shift.  We had to switch between the cash register and clean. We both could not be on the cash register at the same time unless we had 3 or more customers in line or if customer has a long request. When I turned management I had to do paper work in the morning and take out anything that the other employee could not get to. Then, I trained new employee, and took care of any complaints the costumer had. I enjoy the people I worked with, never a dull moment. There was always something to do."
good,"Everything is systematic, documented and organize. Has multinational co-workers and a good management from superior."
good,"Everything in ExxonMobil is already in placed. There is always a process for everything you want to do, be it in your task, procurement, HR, general activity etc."

good,"ExxonMobil has a very structured work environment, but a very inflexible work culture, the firm is usually slow to change. Though, they are making strides and the new campus in Woodlands is an example of that."
good,"Depending on the day I would come in early, unload merchandise that the vendors would bring in to the store and stock the merchandise on shelves. The hardest part of the job was working by yourself, sometimes it was nice, other times it was difficult, it made time go slow. The management was wonderful, they care a lot about their customers and their employees and making sure they are happy. I learned that customers are always right even if they aren't always right. The pay was good. The most enjoyable part of the job would be talking to the customers and making them smile."
good,"I enjoyed going to work. I learned a lot on my job and I was eager to  continue to learn and grow in my position. Management is like everything else, there are no perfect apples they all have their bruises but some are more polished than others. I met a lot of great people while I was there. Idon't know if I could say there was a hard part to my job as I love a challenge. The most enjoyable was learning something new everyday and not being bored."

I had learned how to use the SAP efficiently and providing excellent customer service to our customers and clients. Procuring maintenance material in timely manner for urgent repairing and also make arrangement in logistics."
good,Customer Service and porper data entry was the main dutie. I learned to have patience woth the customers and how to maintain inventory. I worked most shifts alone  so I didnt really have much experience woth co-workers. The ahrdest part of the job was the work hours. I mostly enjoyed seeing new faces and being able to assist with customer needs.
good,"Great coworkers."

good,"Opening the store on time and delivering the best customer service possible was a typical day at work. Also, I ran the register, store order items, daily paperwork, daily bank deposits,and stayed over if an employee called in. Having to reprimand a worker was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was getting off work."
good,"typical day is cash handling, customer service, stocking, receiving and ordering"
good,Exxon has incredible benefits for it's permanent employees. Unfortunately it is increasingly using contract workers for a great deal of positions. Also they seem to still be behind the times when it comes to gender equality. At the administrative meetings it's almost all women. At the management meeting it's almost all men. The people are nice to work with at least.

I was 1-going to a wedding, 2-Im not about to cancel my flight. "

There was constant interaction between me and new customers and regulars, who were welcoming from day one and always friendly, which was the most enjoyable part of the job. While working the register, I was also expected to keep the store clean and tidy. The end of every shift involved restocking and preparing the store for the next worker to make the transition smooth for everyone. Although I didn't see much of either personally, the management and my other co-workers seemed very dependable because everything I needed was always there and where it was supposed to be, which made my job easier.

good,"A little too political for me. Great job security, not a technical company. Management makes all the decisions, even the technical ones, despite not having the qualifications to make those decisions."
good,"No project was exactly the same and required some new process to learn. The work places were for the most part comfortable and safe.  Coworkers and Supervisors were professional and easy to work with. As most jobs, there are always milestones and deadlines to meet and was probably the hardest part of the work."

But being such a large company i understand experiences can vary from group to group. I've heard other (ex)employees really dreading going into work the next day due to not liking their supervisor/managers. I do think in the past few years this has improved but still has a ways to go."
good,A empresa se preocupa muito com seus funcionários e o ambiente de trabalho é muito bom.

I accomplished so many things while I was there such as basic accounting skills, computer skills, customer service, communication skills etc. The hardest part of the job was when a certain customer did not know how to speak English. However, I handle people who don't know how to speak English very well because I speak 3 languages myself. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that the other employees were respectful towards one another. If someone had to switch hours or a day for a certain reason, a person would always volunteer."

I did learn more on writing email to suit the business, filling, excel and data entry. management seem to choose their favorites and stick to giving them the new tasks, not much to say there. co-workers were amazing, didn't spend much time with them, since work was none stop, but I knew them enough to love them. the hardest part was to take breaks, you get wrapped up in work that time flies by.

good,"por conta do ranking a competição acirrada entre os funcionários cria um ambiente hostil, onde a cooperação entre os colegas não é incetivada."
good,"It was a challenge for me but a very easy job. I just take care of the store's cleanliness and keep an eye on the business. The store manager is very difficult, disrespectful, and rude. Majority of customers stopped coming because of the manager's attitude. As for me, my work went unnoticeable and she made things worse for me as she would let other workers by on their jobs not being done correctly. People would even quit on their first day, as to how horrible the manager is."

good,Fun place to work when started when everyone did what they where supposed to and showed up on time.  Everyone showed up at least 10 min early.  Manager made sure every shift did stocking and cleaning.  No one was left to work by themselves.  Then Exxon started to move moving the managers around and staff started to come and go as chose and not all shifts continued to stock and clean.  Each manager change got worse.

good,The hardest part of the job is to find things to do when all of your work is done and you have no customers. You aren’t allowed to sit down. So it is best to figure out how to time your duties to your shift.
good,very unique environment to work in. have to be able to handle the weather and any other form of job task asked. all though weekends were off when bad weather is in the area there would be no work without pay.

good,I enjoyed working there the peole where amazing for the most part...The work was simple and there was always something to do. If they were to hire me back i would gladly accept
good,Good place to work good benefits and wages.  Opportunities for advancement.  Safe work place.  Work/life balance is poor depending on the department. Management could do more to interact with and develop employees.
good,I Love The Job. Its Something That I Would Love To Do Again. I Am A People's Person So Its Not That Hard For Me To Communicate With People. I Love The Hours And The Pay That They Gave Me.
good,"The store management is employee/customer friendly like family.    The job is located at an international airport area and excellent for developing multi-cultural customer service."
good,"Look for stable job. I just wish Exxon would have recognized dependable, loyal, discipline and knowledgeable contractors in order to hire them direct."
good,"Excellent Management"

good,Nice  helping  good  job  nice  company  give information about our jobs  nice  good experience is there are working all are employers give to some information about for jobs
good,this job gave me a lot of learning experience to better myself in the it skill set. Most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the Exxon Mobil customers getting them set up to move into the new campus
good,ExxonMobil is a great place to work; the people are outstanding-I've had amazing managers in my career with the company.  The benefits are wonderful; my co-workers have been great.  My favorite part of the job has been the people I've worked with over the years. The hardest part of the job is the cross-functional management.  It can be difficult to get the needed alignment to move forward on a project as there are always various objectives different parties are trying attain.
good,a  typical day at work is learning new things dealing with different people i enjoy working with co worker the hardest part not enough money i left here and went to kroger because they pay more
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at EOM. It was a wonderful learning experience fresh out of college. I felt empowered. There were numerous programs and workshops to develop employees and tremendous potential for career advancement. It was a great time and a great place to be.
good,"Busy, safe, and plenty of work. Use cutting edge equipment."
good,"There is always things to do. Can be very fast paced. Managers have a tendency to be new at there job, or at least that is how they act. Pretty much left alone to do your work. Supervisors actually run the place."
good,it was a great place to work. miss those good ole days at Exxon
good,Great place to work . Regular respectful customers. Slower pace compared to other stations. Friendly coworkers and easy job tasks such as customer service janitorial services highly recommend this job
good,"Room for improvement and implementation of few good policies with utmost respect for employees."
good,"My personal experience was pretty atypical for most hires at the time I was hired. I was straight out of high school, and was given an opportunity to start at the bottom and work my way up."
good,"Staff supporting the Executive and his department"
good,"It was an easy interview even though I was nervous when I got there I felt good about my position when i left and was hired soon after, it's a great place to work"
good,A typical work day is checking out customers and providing good customer service. I learned better customer service and how to run a cash register. There was much diversity in the workplace. Hardest part of the job was attending to difficult customers but just do the best customer service and get your manager if it comes down to it.
good,"Good benefits, good co workers. Shifting schedule is not ideal but can allow you to take advantage of doing things during the week. Enjoy the challenge"
good,Job was temporary contract assignment.  Very laid back and good hours.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and would recommend to my friends to work there as well.
good,"Strong Safety culture, inclusive, respectful environment, access to IT Help Desk given new updates to programs rolled out constantly.  Stressful environment."
good,Um not the best of jobs but it was work and I enjoyed working with the customers. Lots of hours and they are flexible. The pay isn't very good but the customers made it all worth it.
good,I loved the job and would go back if they pay more.The job was relaxed and able to maintain with life situations. I just wish they gave benefits and cared more about employees.
good,Exxon was a pretty relaxed work environment. Colleagues were nice and outgoing. It's really quite and cool workplace with a lot of freedom. As long as your daily task is completed work was easy and simple.
good,On your feet all day working on equipment because I was a Machinist/Millwright.They sent me to school for 36 Months to become a Machinist/Millwright to Run a Mill and Lath Also Repair All kinds of Equipment.The Workplace Culture was Extremly High.Hardest part of the Job was not knowing If and When You were Going Home to Your Family.The most Enjoyable part of the Job Was The People You Worked With.
good,"worked in Malabo Equatorial Guinea on a rotational basis. (28 days on and 28 days off). Part of the job was onshore and part offshore on 3 facilities. One FPSO, one FPO and one free standing platform with 40 slot drilling rig."
good,Me gustaria ser islero de nuevo xq tengo experiencia  y dedicacion
good,"Provides excellent training to facilitate work safely in oil refineries."
good,My job was fast paced and high demands.  The department was short staffed and staff  often had to attend multiple meetings which affected productivity.
good,"It's ok, clean but a lot of different employees come and go "
good,"Daily routine is reviewing all 3rd party contractors JSAs, following up on the PTW compliance, 3rd party equipment inspection on the rig, tool box talks, conducting incident/accident investigations and assisting teh Lead Drilling Supervisor in all safety matters. The management team is great to work with as they all share one common drive - work safely and meet the targets without affecting safety of all on board."
good,I come in and cash out customers that pay for gas or purchase items in the store. I enjoy talking with the customers and building a relationship with them.
good,"I loved working there.  I open and close the store.. count product, I stocked the shelves and order out more. I cleaned the restrooms and did outside maintenance."
good,very challenging workplace not a very nice job as customers are not always right and very rude not much training available. not nice owners they don't take much responsibility for there company
good,ExxonMobile was a balanced work atmosphere that provided opportunities for growth and knowledge acquisition . One other aspect of the organization I liked was the welfare package of the permanent staff. I was a contract staff and felt well treated-That goes to show how well the preferment employees must be treated.
good,"Empresa multinacional robusta, equipes bem coordenadas e unidas."
good,I pumped gas for customers.  I learned the differnce between regular gas and diesel.  Management is always respectful and fair. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the weather conditions.
good,"I learned and furthered my knowledge of company PNL and how the pricing could effect profit along with how to balance the two as to not lose customers. A typical day involved opening the store by 5:30 in the morning and taking care of news paper inventory, doing daily paper work and balancing of books and product inventory, ensuring cash deposits were properly counted and logged. This company has a wonderful management team and team work between managers of other stores. It is an enjoyable place to work but due to relocation being necessary for our family due to my fiances job it is necessary for a new job to be acquired for me."
good,"I have been with Exxon for over three years, in that time I have worked for two owners and a handful of managers, all have been  great people. We went from super busy to super slow, due to highway construction and and area expansion. I maintained my position that the store could be awesome again, and this week my faith was proven, with the opening of Fuzzys Taco and Golden Chick restaurants in the store."
good,"Great working and safe environment, always busy when work is available. The coworkers I worked among made the job safe, secure and great to work at."
good,"Exxon mobil is a great company to work for. The store I worked for was owned by a local couple. I worked for the couple on weekends and some nights. The couple had suffered a great loss of there oldest son and needed help running there store, and asked if I would come work for them. I gladly accepted. There wasn't much room for advancement as it was a small store, in a small town. I worked mainly the register and in the mornings I worked their deli. I also lived in the small town so I enjoyed interacting with my community.  My daughter could come to work with me in the mornings and they would take her to school. Overall a very good work environment."
good,"This was a very busy station, but a free environment to work as well. Nice customers to offer service is other side of joy. I always enjoyed to work with the supervisor who is very helpful and cooperative. Employees were helpful and big hearted.,"
good,"Lot of good guys, lot of work to keep busy, but there is a lot of paperwork to do for even simple jobs.  If you are a good self starter and can manage your time well and don't need a lot of supervision to get your work done then you will go far here."
good,"*Manejo del personal,armado de horarios,atención al cliente,control de stock, informes,etc."

good,"Was enjoyable place to work, the enviorment was very professional and courteous, I learned so much about safety and operations, my co-workers there have become life long friends."
good,"The management is the most competant with regard to getting project completed, fulfilling requirments, and taking care of the user base and application owners that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. I was involved with several high profile project in the Global Information Systems group and one for the Upstream managment section."
good,Exxon is a good entry level retail oriented job. You can move up easily and with good experience. Recommend to anyone looking to find a way into customer service jobs.
good,Great company to work for great management fantastic bos to work for very understanding and compassionate close to where i live so it made getting to work very easy.
good,I used to look forward to going to work at Exxon Mobil because it was a good way to make money and also stay out of my head. The customers took a liking to me because of the genuine care in areas of their lives that they maybe would want to seek a different point of view. The management there treated me with respect as I showed my respect for them.
good,"I really enjoyed figuring out how to make equipment run more efficiently and longer. Example would be running oil thru a furnace that is off. Doing this cools the oil. You should bypass the furnaces and allow enough through the furnace to keep pipe from fouling. When I brought this up at a meeting all were shocked they didn’t think of it earlier. That’s just one example."
good,Good environment for workers. Very friendly staff. Nice area so costumers are nice and compassionate.The only problem working here is the growth is slow.
good,"You'll learn to multi-task."
good,"I loved working for Exxon Gas Station, however the Exxon I worked at was privately owned and ran along with a mechanics shop so since I was the only one working it got to be stressful on the hours"
good,Busy work schedule. had to cover several miles and check several units daily.  On call at night two or three nights per week.  Management was good and the workplace had a very safe culture.  The job was an outside job and required working a lot of overtime sometimes. Overall a pleasant but busy place to work.
good,Too easy for me to work with the store and have fun too friendly with the peoples. I'm was under the table... I like to make a money as credit for myself
good,"I enjoyed working at exxon in Blaine.  I had a great team and great customers.  One of the best parts was getting to know the customers in the area, and helping the same people and building those relationships"
good,"Good amount of corporate involvement.  Clean, Clean, and clean some more.  It's fun to talk to people that are traveling."
good,Working for Exxon was and excellent opportunity because it opens up a lot of doors for future jobs.  Worked with excellent employers and employees.  It was a nice environment.
good,"Learned customer service. Team building skills. Restocked  coolers and shelves. Overall a great company to work for."
good,pay was excellent.  benefits were amazing. HR system was fair and balanced.  great discounts.  ability to transfer to other locations only with local management approval which was non-existent.
good,"Empresa excelente para se trabalhar, tive uma aprendizagem muito grande no ramo de químicos. Foram cinco anos de experiência em logística, supervisionando uma equipe de seis operadores no setor de carregamento em auto tanques com diversos tipos de produtos químicos perigosos. No ano de 2015 tivemos uma desagradável acontecimento na empresa, toda operação do terminal (TIG) Terminal Ilha do Governador que ficava situada no Rio de Janeiro foi transferida para Santos (São Paulo) devido a esta mudança ficamos sem o nosso emprego. Desde então estou a procura de uma nova colocação no mercado de trabalho, e que devido aos fatos que se passa na politica brasileira agravaram o desemprego no país."
good,"was a good place to work, had good benefits and pay was good. overtime was the only downfall. you never knew if you where going to be working late or working weekends till the last min."
good,"excelentes benefícios, ambiente de trabalho agradavel"

good,"During the course of my work, I had the opportunity to work with people from diverse cultural background. This greatly improved my interpersonnal and communication skills and I am very grateful for that."
good,A typical work day is average on sales. I learned to work with other sales associates and customers. I opened and closed registers. I worked on the register and offered credit cards and store membership for rewards. I worked on shipments and mail outs. I did markdowns and did floor sets. I set up visual. I re-ticket unpriced merchandise. I have knowledge on the company's policy. I enjoy satisfying customer needs.
good,"Somewhat covert evaluation style. Lots of training opportunities. Many global opportunities. I got to work in many countries.  Co-workers were among the sharpest, and smartest people I hae ever met."
good,"my day would begin with counting the safe balancing the registers for the next shift walking the floor to check for saftety, and cleanliness. and fill in where I was short at"
good,I loved this place because they understand where i was coming from i  learned how close a shift to the fullest to see if i am short for the day.
good,"Foco em controles, aprendizagem e resultados.Controles administrativos e indicadores de desempenho (kpi´s): análise e resolução de problemas com clientes (back office), faturamento, contratos, financeiro, fiscal e cobranças. Atividades estratégicas em projetos como diagnóstico de problemas, desenvolvimento de novos processos com gerências/outros setores, procedimentos, controles e treinamentos resultando em otimização e padronização de atividades, redução de custos, diminuição de índices de inadimplência. Controle de terceirizados, migração de atividades para outros países."
good,This store is an awesome place to be apart of the team. The only reason I am not currently employed there was at the time I was not recieving enough hours. The community in which you work with is friendly and inviting.
good,As a young man I did not see myself advancing in this company.
good,"Regardless to what you bring to the table, if this company hires you, then you are going to develop a serious work ethic, a strong attention to detail, and most of all proven leadership skills. It's a win win regardless to the salary, the long hours, or the competitive environment. You are going to be stretched, exposed, tested and proven in the fires of leadership excellence."
good,My experience at exxon was decent. My only critic was the minimum wage pay and the lack of security with female working working at night. Other than that I had and have no complaints
good,"Oregon, being one of the two states where the employees pump the gas for customers, is where I worked for Exxonmobil.  It was a blast.  Granted it was mostly outdoors in ALL kinds of weather, but the job itself was very gratifying."

good,"I enjoy my work and learning every day. I was exposed to the latest "

good,Working with this company is nice. The employees and Management staff are wonderful. I love the interaction I have with my customers. I have even learned a few of them who are my regular customers. And they love me..
good,Tres bon souvenirs de mon emploi en avitaillement comme chauffeur sur les pistes d'orly

good,"Over see the contractors who do data entry of all inspection reports  guaranteeing accuracy of all volumes reported."
good,Very good place to work.  Great work life balance and beautiful campus in spring Texas. Unfortunately as a contractor full time employment is basically nonexistent but it’s not completely out the window.
good,"Best company I have ever worked for. I began as a service hand and worked up to consulting. I worked for them in Nigeria, Chad and Romania.  Managers vary and policies vary, however they all treated me with respect."
good,When i worked for Mobil things were alot different than they are now.  I was able to run the C-Store as i would if i owned it.  Now like most Businesses everything is micro managed from Corporate.
good,It an excellent environment to work. I have learned troubleshooting software and hardware. The management gives importance to the staffs health and conducts monthly health check at work place.
good,I enjoyed working there. I always knew what I would be doing and normally how many hours I'd work. My co workers and I worked great together and shared duties.
good,"was great working with everyone, enjoyed all the managers I worked for. Very friendly environment, the manager treated us all like family and very helpful"

good,"Empresa com estabilidade e bom pacote salarial e com ótimos benefícios. Ambiente de trabalho focado na segurança da informação e segurança no trabalho, ótimos equipamentos para trabalho."
good,Laid back job and great people. Management was excellent. They worked with you when you needed a day off as good as they could. The lay wasn’t much but it was worth the job.
good,"I spent 30+ years at BRPP, 17 on contract, 16 direct employ with Exxon.   Loved the site and the people.  Had many great opportunities while working n the Engineering Dept and in the Maintenance Dept."
good,Fast pace work environment easy to learn. The customers are your mane priority learning the customer makes your job easy. The hardest part is the lunch rush but once you get used to it everything runs smooth.

good,"Good place to work, Safety was in the foremost for the company in completing task. "
good,Typical gas station jo the owner here was awesome. Other than the manager being a bit shifty the owner was a good and fair man. Nothing more nothing less basic cashier job.

good,"My customers was the highlight of each shift I worked, they kept me going.. Made me love my job.. We had a high turn over, so we were always hiring and training new people."
good,I enjoyed working at Exxon because of the customers and the busy atmosphere! Management was great and work well with everyone's schedule. Downside is this type of employment is not a career job.
good,It is different every day. Even if you are responsible for the same tasks there are different customers and circumstances so there is never a dull moment. Above store level managment and owners suck. They make decisions not on your ability or performance but what they see and when you are only there and hour a week what do you really know. This is a franchise that is independently owned.
good,Its a great place to work. The owner(my boss) is an awesome guy with a great heart. The customers are all good chatty people who like to make simple conversation and tell you about their days. The work is simple and easy to learn. The only thing I don't like is there's not much to advance too. I started at 8.50 and only been raised to 9.00 after a year and obvious willingness to work harder for my job.
good,"Great work environment excellent customer service and di"
good,"Loved working there, and loved all my customers. Work with me an around my schedule for school. Always about family first. Very good job and a good company to grow with"
good,Worked many different positions over 32 years of service.  Most of my coworkers are still great friends.  Never thought I would work for any one company that long.

good,I love working forn Exxon. It is a very awesome work place with awesome people. There really isn't an hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable is working with all the different people that come in. The management is great and my boss is the best!
good,A lot of work hours opportunity and on the job training for new positions.Opportunity to be promoted to Leadman or unrated(hourly) or rated(salary) supervisor.
good,"I remember the day when my late Manager fallen sick very suddenly. Our work was closely related. Usually most of the documents were coming from him to me for processing and to be taken into the Accounts software. Due to his sudden sickness he was unable to do it. So he was trying to show me certain things he used to handle so that I can take over the load from him temporarily.  "
good,Typical work day starts with Ensuring all service contractors on the rigs work safely and adhere strictly to all SSHE and operations integrity requirements. I have learnt overtime that focus on the job is an essential part of having fun and at the same time making good progress on assigned job duties. ExxonMobil management is inclined to ensure that all workers have a perfect work life balance.
good,"After shift change, review the previous days work load with colleague and management."
good,This employer is a very nice place to work I worked there for over 30 years There is a lot opportunity to advance The most enjoyable part is everyday was something different

good,"Enjoyed going to work everyday loving myb job and working as though it were my company and doing what it took to succeed. I learned technical capabilities, I learned to prioritize, personal and professional development and organizational skills. Upper management was accommodating and respectful.Co-workers were easy to work with, respectful and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was working with people in a leadership position that had a closed negative mind and a ""My way or no way"" attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that had a open positive mind with a  "" We can do attitude"" sharing our best practises and aquired knowledge with each other."
good,company listened to suggestion implemented those that benefitted work enviroment allowed for advancememt and wage appropriate gains
good,"A typical day at work would consist of daily paperwork, opening store procedures and balancing tills. While working at Exxon I have leavened the value of extensive customer service and business relationships. he hardest part of my job has and always will be leaving at the end of my day with projects uncompleted. Fellow employees' are fantastic and a joy to work will, courteous and diligent workers. I find the customer base to be the most enjoyable party of working there, the friendly and personal connections you gain serving the same people on a daily basis."

good,"My day would start at 7:00 am. The staff at Exxon normally arrived between 8:00 to 9:00 am. My manager, emphasized help to all Exxon staff, was and would be my first priority, there were no exceptions. I loved going to work every day, there was never a bad day. If an opening became available, I would apply in a heartbeat for employment."
good,"Ottima società ,  ambiente lavorativo ottimo , colleghi eccezionali l'unica nota negativa era il mio contratto a tempo determinato durato 5 anni"

good,"Very efficient in technical knowledge."
good,"Safety Meetings/Classes is a Must, Work hrs. is flexible. Benefits are the greatest. Employees are enrolled in Life Insurance 31 days after being hired. Work place is a little tight, not as much privacy as it was. The hardest part is getting from bldg. to bldg. within a few minutes."

good,excelente ambiente de trabajo. horas flexibles. facil de trabajar con gerente.
good,Ok. It’s a promising career but it’s truly not for everyone. It is time consuming. And it becomes difficult to balance out life and work. But it truly is a great company
good,I had a contract position and initially temp to hire. My contract ended and not renewed and I left the company for a full time position with benefits. I enjoyed the challenges
good,ExxonMobil was a great job. Operations help out tremendously with permits. Management was amazing they cared for all employees on the job. Safety was excellent.
good,"If you work hard, you will be recognized.  I learned that I don't know enough about corporate environment.  management was evergreen in some positions, but long lasting in others.  the culture is diverse.  the hardest part of the job was being an ExxonMobil employee.  the most enjoyable part of the job was being an ExxonMobil employee."
good,Working at ExxonMobil Nigeria was a very good challenge. IT COULD BE DANGEROUS AT TIMES BUT WOULD Be WILLING TO GO BACK. I has a great boss that would back you at every decision.
good,Working on the cutting edge of technology and innovation.  Commitment to better.  Like many large corporations there are downsides to navigating the business.  If unable or unwilling to relocate career becomes stagnant.

On a daily basis it is important that all fridges are full, garbages have been taken out, outside has been swept, and mainly that the customers remain happy. This job has taught me that life is not always sweet and that there will be days where trouble does come, but you most handle it professionally and must also have the customer leave with a smile even if they are in the wrong. The management at ExxonMobil is great because the manager, Ali, is a man who has the love from every customer and employees as well. He is flexible with work hours and also knows every solution to ExxonMobil whenever any employee runs into a problem. In my experience, the hardest part of the job would be satisfying the customers when they complain about certain issues such as the gas prices, card scams, or with the car wash. Another issue that is difficult with my job would be when a customer drives off with the gas nozzle and I must take their information because their is now lots of gas on the ground that I must clean up, but even worse, the customer's expression shows that they are nervous or frustrated which makes me feel quite bad but it must be done. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of my job is when I help many customers and they continuously compliment me and go to my manager and also tell him how well I am. In the end, ExxonMobil has taught me about people, life, and taught me how to adjust myself to any workplace I decide to work after I leave."
