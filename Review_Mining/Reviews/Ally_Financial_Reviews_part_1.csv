rating,review
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,"After being layed off, I was not given a fair opportunity to secure employment within Ally, yet I was told in training that I was valued."
bad,Management is disrespectful and doesnt respect the reps that put in years and years of dedication and loyalty. Work life balance sucks and if management doesnt like you they will make your life horrible until they fire you or you quit.
bad,Treats employees like garbage. Management doesn't even take time to learn your name. High revolving door rate due to unrealistic expectations. Don't waste your time here
bad,Do not waste your time working here the manager have their favorites and they only care about numbers nothing else. Pay is wack please avoid this place .
bad,Toxic environment with toxic management. You'll regret coming here. Management doesn't have the slightest clue what their employees are going through.
bad,I currently work for Ally Financial as a CCG agent. My job is not stressful but the amount of pressure from the manager is stressful. I process refund and also take inbound calls. The QC and QA  is very hard to maintain each month. The company is not organized or professional. The company only cares about making money. It’s very sad to work for a company that don’t pay much and it’s hard to get promoted.
bad,"nice place, good people just few bad management . Lots of management from GMC who are discrimination and HR is Joke. but overall I have a good time and worked with amazing people."
bad,"No communication, management is terrible. No work life balance and it’s a challenging environment. The company is growing quickly but cannot keep up with their growth."
bad,"Contractors are treated horribly.  Hostile work environment.  Verbal abuse, absurd requirements, being told to do something, doing it, then being told you were told to do something completely different and being called stupid, etc.  Being told to treat others unfairly if you want to keep your job.  Horrible experience."
bad,"The leadership team lacks integrity, they do not treat all employees with fairness nor are they organized in their hiring processes. They lack professionalism."
bad,"Horrible managers, allowed people to be overworked while others did nothing....and just horrible people. I suggest not to work here unless you want to be miserable every day of your life."
bad,Stay away from the Consumer Asset Management operations at all costs. This operation has had several discriminatory lawsuits from ex-employees. This branch is built on nepotism. The senior leadership team has the power to do anything they wish with absolutely no repercussions for their unethical actions.
bad,Moral is low. Pay is sub par. You’re simply just a pawn in their game. You get used up until you have nothing left. There is no career advancement. If there is you don’t know about it or get overlooked. The benefits are ok. The management style is questionable. Lots of favoritism
bad,"Management is terrible, to the point of lawsuits. Workload is changed all of the time, promotions on connections not merit. Bad work environment in general. Get your experience and go some place better."
bad,Very stressful environment management HR department or very unprofessional have a tendency to be unfair to certain employees for no cause reason no chance of promotion low hourly pay
bad,"Management is very bad, company does not care for their employees, or does anything to make taking calls and being abused by customers better."
bad,"I interviewed for a client care position in Shoreview MN and after meeting with the site director, I thought it was a great fit. A perfect vision and career. "
bad,"Terrible place to work. No opportunity for advancement. I worked there with no raise for the first six years at $13.50 an hour. The seventh year, they gave me a $0.40 raise.  In the seven years I worked there fifteen people that I worked with me died."
bad,I worked for this company for 9 years. Started in collections and eventually moved into the customer service role. Management here is very racist. They do not care about your family or outside life. Within my time here people have died just form the stress alone here at Ally. It is a very cut throat environment. This is not the place to be if you have a family or have issues outside of work.
bad,"I was not very happy to work for this company.  I took my work seriously and became very good at what I did for the company.  The pay was not appropriate for the work that was being done.  As an employee I did not feel very appreciated of my work, which made me feel unable to reach advancements within the company."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans.

The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,"After going through the interviews they still have doubts about my abilities. They will never respect you and or give you rewards for all the things that you do outside of the scope of your work. "
bad,i dont have much to say about the jobs i had. they were all very good to me. i just want to find another job that is a better fit for me.
bad,"This is not a company you want to invest your time in, They are rude and very unprofessional."
bad,I have nothing nice to say about working at this company and therefore prefer not to disclose any information about Global Response. Thank you.
bad,"Biased unethical Leadership in Loss Mitigation. Culture that speaks on leading and doing so by example but doesn't require that their Leaders do so. Culture that allows disparate treatment to its customers and its employees as long as the higher ups aren't aware of it.  No structured training, or foundations to allow employees to excel. Leadership that doesn't know what being a ""Leader"" really means."
bad,"This was by far the WORST job experience in my whole professional career. I supported the servicing and collections business within Ally and I will be the first to say that they have no concept of work life balance, they are known for underpaying their salaried employees and favoritism, management is notorious for exploiting favoritism and nepotism policies within the organization. Morale was constantly low and they have a very high turnover rate. If you aspire to be successful and to make inroads in your next career move, I would be very careful about working here."
bad,"I have been with Ally for the last 7 years. I started with a sister company, Nuvell. It was much smaller and more family friendly at that time. The company changed to Ally about 5 years after I started. We joined with our parent company, which was GMAC at that time. Once the merger and the name change took place we began to see a shift in management and company concern for its employees. Our joint operation meant more people, and less opportunity for management to concern themselves with our needs. In this time there were few advancement opportunities to be had, and we were asked to sacrifice more of our personal time to company  business. This has led to low morale within the company."
bad,"Horrible pay, benefits are expensive and all promotions are hand picked from the ""inside"" few.   They will make you go through the whole process even though the person has already been selected."
bad,Just an awful place. The level of smugness and superiority from local management was sickening. Wrong is one thing. Smug and wrong is another. Don’t do it. Just don’t.
bad,good company if your in the right department and stay to yourself. the job is full of drama and nothing is done about it. collections is every person for themselves and they could care less who doesnt pay you have to find away to collect the money to keep you job
bad,"Lied about discussing time off for illness. I hatend going to work because if you don't dress how they want then you will be talked about and excluded. They tried to force me to go to outings outside of work hours and asked personal questions. Unprofessional, rude, liars."
bad,"Basically, you will be updating spread sheets and taking inventory from the bottom up. No official database other than ServiceNow, everything else is Excel. No direction given but you will be expected to hit the ground running and show initiative and be innovative. Be prepared to work days, evenings, and late into the night sometimes."
bad,"Work environment could be great but when working with a group of women that are very petty, gossiping, jealous, and non professional wears a toll on you. "
bad,"Too much GM DNA still in this company. Company is trying to be hip and cool like a tech company with open floorpans and workspaces, but it turned out they only did it because it let them cram more people onto each floor.  CEO is constantly waving the flag for his ""core values"" while his direct reports go around knifing each other in the back. It's a finger pointing culture where outliers get pounded down and the bearer of bad news is the one who gets the blame. There are some good people who care, but leadership is mostly toxic, and that's breeding middle managers who are toxic as well."
bad,The mortgage department did not have the infrastructure to abstain. The management team was never in sync or supportive. The employees were on happy and issues were never addressed. The company on the mortgage side over promised and under delivered. They were not true to their core values. The main one was to do it right and they never did.
bad,Bonuses based on direct competition rather than proviductivity.  Team assignments  are switched frequently making it difficult to form relationships.  Nepotism is prevalent throughout the company.
bad,"Staff is treated very poorly. "
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans.

bad,Always watched by those who are not watched. They say one thing and do another.
bad,"Your Schedule changes from month to month. This would not be a job for anyone with a family or any kind of outside life. The Upper Management is extremly incompetent and changes are made to their policies and procedures whenever they feel like it. Your job can be threatened if a member of management doesn""t like you. The performance expectations are unattainable and the stress level is through the roof!"
bad,"not available to discuss at this time        "
bad,This company has a hiring policy which attracts and even rewards underperforming employees simply because they will work for less than the industry standard. There is no benefit to advancing within the company because no financial incentive is provided for additional responsibility. The poor quality of employees is truly shocking; whoever they made in charge of hiring has poor judgment. You will be stuck paying the price as your surroundings get worse by who they hire. Senior employees are hanging on by a thread.
bad,"Some people can pick their start time in the morning. Some contractors who get pay by hour from staffing company are forced to work overtime without overtime pay. Very stressful to work with manager in accounting department who doesn't have accounting background. Very little luck to explain things to direct manager who doesn't have specific project experience, and this causes work very inefficient and frustrate."
bad,I was made to feel like an outsider. Never felt like I belonged there. Management was never very helpful and the whole training process was kind of a joke.
bad,Management within the company can never make up their minds on how to run the company.  One week they are total soft in their treatment on the employee’s the next week they are counting being 1 minute late as an occurrence.  There is NO life/work balance. The worse part is that everyone has to agree on something before you can move forward with anything. No one is in charge they all think they are the boss.
bad,Management are cutthroat and can’t be trusted. I don’t recommend this company. High turnover rate. The schedules were good but management makes it very hard to work there.
bad,Cut throat management!  Initially Ally offers a open and inclusive culture based on employee growth.  Don’t believe it.  Employees and dealers have little faith in seeing the same people in the same roles.  High turn over.
bad,"Culture is very siloed, no collaboration among internal teams. Very bureaucratic and disorganized. Management is the worst I've ever seen. The people are very nice and everyone enjoys one another."
bad,"Management is poor. None of them are on the same page about anything. They don’t care about their employees, only how good their numbers look at the end of the year. Pay was low but we got quartley updates about how much money the company is making. Overall job was fairly easy, just very poorly managed."
bad,They choose friends over work ethic and knowledge of a job. They lay-off too many times to stay. Managers let people play and not work and then promote them.
bad,"This job is pretty awesome. It can be stressful at times like any other job, but it's pretty laid back for the most part. The benefits are top notch. The work culture is very positive."
bad,"As a Temp, you will find yourself learning on your own, and knowing the business better than those who have been in the business for year. I was not provided with the proper training, in fact I was trained by other Temps."
bad,"Daily I am required to answer phones and assist customers or attorneys with any questions that they may have. Completing paper work in a timely matter due to deadlines. "
bad,I have worked for this company for 2 yrs and it has been great but the moving up in the company opportunities needs to increase.

The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,"over worked, stressing, never feel appreciated, you tell management your complaints and issues over and over again and they do nothing about it. they dont care about your mental health and just want to hit their numbers so they look good."
bad,"Watch out for people there,  because if you are high on performance  standings on a score card,  and a coworker wants you gone because of petty jealousy, she will make up something on you and report you to HR .Then you will be out of her way to climb to the top. Or if you like a lot of loud talking and gossiping between team members,  when the supervisor is out of the office and people are not doing what they are supposed to be doing and contributing to the team,then by all means work there. If you like not getting any recognition for your efforts then by all means work there. They look like they have diversity, but they do not. You will not get any raise for your efforts. There are no skilled managers. They let everyone do what they want. Not a good place to work at all. Rotating door policy. When you are gone then  there is one right there to take your place. A lot of incompetence. Beware, they do not investigate anything."
bad,"Benefits are good, pay is so so, but the people are horrible to work with.   No collaboration if you're not part of the ""in crowd"".  They are allowed to publicly bully, berate and belittle.  The ""treat"" others with respect core values and policies are in place to say they have it, it is not practiced at all."
bad,"The company as an organization was dependable, however management was unstable, and would definitely throw lower level employees under the bus to save themselves."
bad,"Primary focus is towards millennials, particularly young males. Growth potential and opportunity is virtually non-existent if you are not in this group. "
bad,"I stayed stressed because everyone is looking to get rid of the competition instead of having a team spirit, they don't try to step up as they think it is easier to step on someone to get to the spot above"
bad,"terrible management , lack understanding and proper policy to follow , stressful atmosphere from lack of communication between employee feedback and authority action . there is however an opportunity to make a lot of money in incentive pay on a monthly basis which the only pro of the job."
bad,Their Quality Control Monitoring Department is horrible.  You have to be perfect in everything or else they will look for reasons to get rid of you...

bad,"wouldn't work here, micro manage, treat you kids instead of adults. no attendance policy so it is based on if your supervisor likes you or not. fun co-workers!"
bad,"Ally Financial culture is an attempt to skirt  the law there is constant requirement of a plus 40hr work week with no compensation, either time-off or additional pay. A number of mid-level managers walk at trot with heads down fearing someone may ask a question requiring an answer. Every time you enter the building in Detroit, you don’t know if it’s your last."
bad,Poorly run.  Too many layers of management.  If you don't work in NC you have no career path.  No path forward for Ally in any industry other than auto loans.
bad,"The right management = awesome... moving forward"
bad,Ally is very unorganized at the moment due to system and management changes. This is making it very difficult for employees to do their jobs effectively and consistently
bad,"Management is toxic, hold work is not rewarded. You must network to get ahead. It is hard to advance, and also difficult to work in an environment where one hand does not talk to the other."
bad,No company moral. No opportunities to grow. No sick time and management will control your next role. Regardless of your path to grow. They hire people with no work experience in the business and limit the deserving candidate for personal growth.
bad,A very cut throat place to work and upper management are not qualified for the job. They will lie and go behind your back to fix numbers to control the scorecard. If you want high stress and always wondering when you will be fired Ally is for you.
bad,"@ Ally Financial I collect on loss mitigation account's that have been deemed total loss , unpaid charges, I am expected daily to call on 100 outbound calls and 100 calls for the day.  also take calls on the dialer half the day"
bad,"Leadership from a Sr. Director level and above is very poor. Little to no consideration for employees, their time or anything pertinent outside of work."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,"I have worked for Ally for about a year now and have had an abysmal time. Most managers agree that the communications within the company are dysfunctional but have made no attempts to change it. When I was hired, I was told there was a great amount of opportunity for promotion within the company. Now that I have been with the company for a year, 10% of the positions were discontinued and there is no opportunity for growth. Numbers matter most to this company and every detail of my day is scrutinized. Finally, my day is incredibly boring. I complete the same tasks every day with no variation whatsoever."
bad,Department was awful. No training and what training was available was poorly written and was out of data. Management is very high schoolish. Don't need it and was not interested in staying there.
bad,"on the phone with customers, very business one hour lunch and two 15 mins breaks. Learned to be helpful with each customers. You cannot please every customer."
bad,"No upper management structure to grow into. All latteral advancement only.  Since  this company received the large bailout, nothing changes.  After  two  years of the typical role you find yourself  in, no extra incentives."
bad,"Just was not the right fit, career growth was minimal, and other job opportunities within the company were out of state and normally on the east coast."
bad,You get denied Often to move up often they overlook you for “their friend” even though you’re the experienced one  you never get feedback and under appreciated
bad,"Very unhappy with management there is favoritism and low pay it’s who you know here not what you know. There was a restructure in Lewisville, TX and all the new hires within the past year were let go."
bad,"typical day-8am to 5 or 7pm, hour lunch, make outbound calls, take inbound calls, get in trouble for building a rap-ore with customers,  they want you off the call and on to the next asap.  "
bad,Ally does not give raises. The average bonus if you get one is between $250-$1200 for a whole year's worth of work. They are under staff and they know it.
bad,There is no infrastructure in place at ALLY. The mortgage department is in shambles and management is slow to address any concerns. The loan officer position is awful and there is no opportunity. You receive sub-prime leads with no programs that you can offer your book of business. The higher ups only care about the business need and how to adjust the numbers in their favor. Poorly paid and barley any commission to make. They promised  a six figure salary and you will be lucky to hit 65k with what they have going on. I've heard its getting worse and they have a high turn over rate with the current MLOs. What a nightmare.
bad,"Worked hard.  Was told would convert to an FTE but let me go due to market pressures that pushed them to let contractors go."
bad,In certain areas of the fulfillment team is micromanaged and makes up their own rules. They come up with outrageous goals for you to meet and hold you accountable. They bring in people without corporate knowledge making more than current employees with more corporate experience. The pay is still not good for the amount of work and stress that you go through. They dont believe in full staff and over work employees. They dont provide monthly bonuses for the amount of work given. They also block any advancements if they cant afford to lose you. Benefits suck and the good pkg is expensive.
bad,Its certain  depts that won't allow you to advance . mgmt has their favorites. Mandatory overtime in certain depts and you will be written up if you Dont submit to the Ot
bad,"Good bonus but the structure is bad, the managment doesnt care about their employees and the jobis very stressful. Lately we have been hiring like crazy and the management has been hiring a lot of young people and their is a lot of drama now. Save yourself and apply somewhere else. I only came here because I got laid off previously and my unemployment ran out and I needed a job."
bad,Awful work/life balance here. They are numbers driven even with new employees. They are hard to work for and the management does not treat their employees as people with families or feelings-its all about the numbers here. You can make good money as long as you work with no days off. I worked 2 weeks straight one time with no days off. When I asked for a comp day- they treated me as if I was not a loyal employee.
bad,"The organization is inefficient and dysfunctional. Senior management lacks respect for employees' time and opinions and manages by intimidation. Processes are grossly inefficient and poorly conceived, resulting in repeated process changes, delays and employee overtime. The lack of work flow automation causes employees to input the same info, often clerical, repeatedly across tasks. . Management seems to hire talented employees but then doesn't trust them with the simplest of tasks; little is accomplished without multiple manager approvals. Checkers checking checkers...."
bad,There is a lot of favoritism. The management team is one big click. The only people that get promoted are people that are connected to someone on the management team. If you are not friends with your manager you will be micromanaged.
bad,"Great place to make money especially while in school to further education, like myself. Its Defiantely a regular call center environment, but being rated number 1 call center in Ark and the pay is good while it lasts. Its dog eat dog for the bonuses.The seniors there usually complain about everything yet they still there. High turn over rate."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,Don't work here if you don't absolutely have too. I really don't know why I have to waste keystrokes offering any more detail on this company. DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF.
bad,"Management always seems to find the bad in there outgoing employees compared to the several plus things that they have, big downer for a lot of the employees."
bad,Very poor upper management. Many threats to employers about being fired multiple times per week. Which makes people unhappy uncomfortable and stressed . There are mandatory test you have to pass in training or you will be fired.
bad,The job was ok but the salary was quite low compared to the job expectations.  The hours were ok after advancing off the phones.  The management was fine but there was constant turnover
bad,"Get to work on time,"
bad,What I learned was not to share your educated opinion if it challenges status quo or you'll be seen as someone resistant to change and terminated. Management and H.R. puts themselves above others but they lost some good people for lack of communication and/or poor communication. They lost some of their greatest managers recently.
bad,It's a different environment then I was used to- their technology is still in the 90's and the people were fantastic but the managers although nice people lacked in people skills.
bad,The culture when I was there had diminished a lot. It became painful to go to work. I was privileged to work with some good people and a great company. From what I hear the culture has improved so in underwriting the only issue (for me) is the work/home life balance.
bad,Decades of experience got me the job but no degree left me treated like I had no voice. Inclusive culture doesn’t apply to you if you’re an EA. They determine your worth as a person by your ability to advance. Leadership sets the tone by belittling others & rolling their eyes in meetings when HR presents ways to reward lower level employees. Toxic environment is not worth the pay.
bad,Lots of work to do at Ally. Every department seems to be understaffed and the company will layoff instead of moving existing employees to new positions and training.  Management can be harsh at times and the workload is high.  Easy to burn out at Ally.
bad,"some areas of Ally are very well run, Capital Markets is just not one of them. Department is run by people that have been let go from other companies."
bad,Less focused on auto industry and more focused on internet bank.  Restructuring lead to 10% reduction in sales force in my region with tightening underwriting for auto loans.
bad,Good place to go if you want to get a feel of what it is like to work in a call center. For those that are trying to find out what a call center is about this is a great start. The pay is not that great for the work you have to do!
bad,"The management is HORRIBLE!!!!! this would be a nice place to work if the management was not so bad, the team leads do nothing but talk about their team NEVER willing to help and are never at their desk. They pick favorites on new jobs that open. Only good thing here is their maternity leave because you get to be gone for 4 MONTHS bad thing is if you do not find something else you have to come back."
bad,"In the department the work was very easy but, with management issues it tended to be more complicated than needed.No comradery amongst a supposed  ""team"" atmosphere."
bad,"Direct management is top notch.  Senior management is not.  Some very smart and motivated engineers among a sea of mediocre employees. When the Economy tanked, they brought on all kinds of folks with various skillsets.  And then kept them.  For a seven year old+ banking institution, it amazed me every day that it is still run off Excel Spreadsheets and Access Databases."
bad,"Ally Canada was bought by RBC for 4.1 billion dollars in late 2012.  Transition into RBC Automotive and the subsequent shut down of the Bloor/Islington office took about 10 months (Auto Finance department, 8th floor).  They held on to me until the very end as I was a contracted worker and had no hopes of going to RBC as they were not hiring contracted workers.  Long story short, I worked there for 1.5years, never got hired on by Ally or RBC and there is no longer Ally Canada."
bad,"The training was horrible but only because the man that was doing the training hadn’t had much Training himself. Once I was out of my training, my manager was very helpful and helped me get a great schedule. They had fair grading and approachable managers. The only issue was that it seemed like a lot of clicks there. The people that were being hired as managers weren’t always qualified."
bad,"After the changing of the guard (from GMAC to Ally), there was a drastic shift in the corporate culture and as a result thereof, a change in senior leadership. Ally is still undergoing this cultural shift with managers of all levels leaving and being replaced by those who are inept for the role in which their thrust into."
bad,"If not working in Detroit, little to no room for advancement - all lateral - all beyond your control - plenty of politics and favoritism - benefits are very good"
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,I worked at Ally a year ago.The culture at the Duluth office is horrible.Most people worked in fear.A certain manager got away with bullying employees and the work environment was so cold and toxic.Better opportunities seem to be in other states but the Duluth Ga office run if you can or use it as a stepping stone.You will be micromanaged to the point where you will be so uncomfortable at work.New people get moved around the minute you start to learn their job which creates a lot of anxiety.
bad,"While the bank has great benefits and good salary, they seem to have an approach of managing people by emails and a total lack of personal involvement.  Complaints are not valued but rather retaliated against."
bad,"SCM for the entire Bank."
bad,"The company is an overall good company. Specific departments, such as mine lack structure. Policies change more often than seems reasonable.  Specific duties are simple once used to them, then they become mundane. Specific personality types can flourish here, but definitely not all."
bad,"I initially joined Ally because of the work/home life balance and benefits. I knew going in that the pay wasn't that great but was given the promise of advancement opportunities annd told that I'd be able to move into the department that I wanted to be in when there was an opening. I saw openings 3 times during my stay in that department, expressed my desire to fill that role numerous times, and was met with excuses each time as to why I wasn't considered for that position. In the meantime I saw one raise for a paltry $.30 (while some hard-working people got no raise at all), got moved into another department that I had no desire to be in because the manager thought I just wanted a change, and my qualifications and skills were completely ignored. I spent 12 years in the car business before Ally, am very well educated in the needs of a car dealership and know how to handle them, and am knowledgeable above and beyond anyone else in their arbitration department in regards to mechanical issues and how an automotive service department works. Management at Ally changes frequently making it difficult to prove yourself because when a manager learns your abilities, he is quickly moved out and you start back from nothing. Raises are far between and typically not even enough to cover cost of living increases, promotions are nearly impossible if you don't know someone, and when applying for other opportunities within the company, you're competing with outsiders as well as other Ally employees. Add to that a total lack of accountability, micromanaging team leads, large workloads, not enough"
bad,"Not a game changing management. They've taken a mix of BoA and Citi play books and they are trying to rehash the old stuff. Middle management is fairly clueless and not capable of motivating their employees."
bad,"Toxic culture with terrible management, HR is extremely awful. Hard working people were not awarded or recognized, would not recommend working here if you have other options."
bad,"The culture is diverse but out of control,  not professional at all, including management. Mybexperince there was a few physical fights, witness to theft, unprofessionalism"
bad,"It was hard to move to different departments. They treated their employees like ""cattle"", a meat market. No monetary increases over years. They had good intentions, like 401k, pto and health insurance. Management was not the best. They had the employees moving desks every month. College degrees really didn't matter too much. Too much drama and too many employees were fired on a daily basis. It was stressful and wasn't a very nice place to work!"
bad,"really not a lot to say..its ok though..better yet its a job , employees are rude..people never take responsibility for there own actions.  Ear hustling nosey people and funny acting back stabbing TLs"
bad,"Very stressful job, most weekends are mandatory, poor leadership, company willing to part ways with their best employees without notice.  The pay is good and the benefits are great, but those are the only positives.  Work here at your own risk, as they tend to promote the wrong people and also release the wrong people due to office politics."
bad,"I enjoyed working there however the downfall was they were taking me away from my family time with lots of OT. 6 days/week became too much for my family. Although this wasn't constant it started to become a trend. Depending on which team you were on you could be in a good environment or not so good. Some managers were willing to work with you while others wouldn't budge. Expect 20+ calls an hour plus other activities to do on top of that. Some people have found ways to cheat the system and those that put their all into their job unfortunately get to be the ones get written up for not reaching goals. If you are single no family & love the drive of money to earn then this job is for you, but if you have a family expect to be at this company more than you see your family. Pay is competitive with other companies in town & like I said benefits are well paid. Just decide what is more important to you: job or your family before applying here."
bad,"There was a lot of doom and gloom the 4 years I was there because the company was under Tarp funding.  I tried to encourage change in spend behaviors, but I consistently saw wasteful spending.  The leadership was stuck in the 1980's."
bad,Used to be a great place to work and then it wasn't. Too many chiefs not enough indians.
bad,"They promise you the world even though they change ur commission around.  Benefits and work life balance is great.  The west managing director thinks she's God's greatest gift and she's dumb as rocks.  High turn over.   You only end up making about 65k a year before tax.  No one follows the LEAD culture.  Look else where, they have lost a lot of good talent."
bad,"Always changing teams and management around in underwriting.  Right hand doesn't speak to the left.  Direct reports all had different objectives and underwriting styles.  When your manager is switched on you every year, it makes it difficult to adjust every year or 6 months when none are underwriting the same.   Went to Ally to get more consistency and security.  Didn't go as planned."
bad,"Management is all about “family comes first” until family actually has to come first. "
bad,Ally is an good place to work for those who enjoy a slower paced call center. Ally is perfect for those who are goal oriented and looking for a career in Auto Financing.
bad,"Management is not qualified for their positions, consistently making mistakes and not treating workers with respect. The atmosphere in the office is stale as well."
bad,"Due to most of the employees have been working together for 20 plus years there is a slight discomfort of management. There are confects of interest there.  there are management issues between other managers that cause issues on the floor. the pay is not competitive, however the culture is good."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
bad,"Work loads were very high due to cutbacks through out the company. Pay was good, but had to be in order to keep resources engaged. I have seen quite a number of recent resignations due to poor management decisions and internal politics. Very toxic working environment. I would think very hard before joining this organization."
bad,I was okay working there. It wasn't bad. It was a bit stressful with quotas. I liked it but was a bit stressful. If you can handle high stressed work environments then this is the job for you.
bad,"Colleagues are helpful. It's a start up location with great potential but don't hold your breath for immediate changes to ideas, adjustments to workflow, operational hours to be extended to 3rd shift because it must go through a chain of command. Supervisors have their limitations and Quality score is contingent with a successful call center. "
bad,The internship was poorly structured and not particularly wall focused to my field of study. Most time was spent on a project that I had little choice in or managerial direction.
bad,"The pay versus employee experience is excellent. However, I was given a fold out table as my desk and had to share with another person.  The Charlotte office is crammed to the gills with workers, and instead of letting people work from home they proposed this solution and said, ""Well we had people work this way for years."" No privacy what so ever, so you have to try to schedule meetings for when there aren't a lot of people around so you can hear. There is a prevailing culture of fear and anyone who suggests best practices is derided. People bully to get their way even if it is not good for the organization as a whole."
bad,"Cold management, managers unqualified for positions other than college degree,"
bad,"This office currently handles accounts that no other office wants to handle.  We are 1% of the portfolio and we migrate risk.  The culture used to be stronger, its a fund place to work with your fully staffed.  Management doesn't seem to be doing anything to help get people in the door.    Team Lead are working 40+ hours in order to stay a float and ensure that their agent are getting the coaching they need.  Company has really good benefits."
bad,"I have enjoyed working for Ally for the past 18 months until I was advised that I would be moving to a different department which is a step down from my current position. Although my pay stays the same, I feel that the job duties are well below my skill level. I have come to this company and within a year I have been awarded with an 'I AM AN ALLY ' Award which is a very big accomplishment. To earn this award your peers submit on your behalf why they feel that you should receive this award. It is then reviewed by a board of executives who then chooses if you will receive the award and the acknowledgement that goes along with it. I have had the opportunity to complete side-by-sides to train the new hires and then BOOM, I'm being moved to another department which again is a step down with no explanation given."
bad,"Opportunity to grow is only for those who are the teachers pet.  Consistently changing payplan.   Work life balance is the best pro along with benefits.  If your looking for something mediocre, this is for you, but if your looking to grow your carrier, look elsewhere."
good,"Management is horrible don't follow the rules but expect you too, pay is very low compared to competitors. Insurance premium is very high; and this company don't like to promote within."
good,Provided service to bank customers by conducting appropriate transactions and meeting the needs of customers by referring them to appropriate departments in the bank.
good,I was a contractor so many of the questions asked are N/A to me.  I was able to complete my assignment before the end of the contract.  My experience with the company was good.
good,"Management needs to improve.  They should consider looking into all options before allowing people to get promotions.  Yearly pay raise should be done every 6 months instead of every year, in my opinion."
good,"You use this place to get you where you need to be in a particular career path. Nothing more. Thankful that I was hired on. But it was nothing more than a call center. Everything is timed. If you use the bathroom too long, the management is checking on you, not to see if you are okay but to remind you of how much time you used while on the throne."
good,"Again, if you just need a gig, this is the place to go.  However, I didn't like it all.  The dept I worked in had just newly moved to Lewisville, TX & they were very unorganized.  They told us that we wouldn't be working weekends & we were working every other weekend.  Also they wanted you to take calls like a robot.  They didn't want you to answer any other questions for the caller other than providing dealer quotes, but they didn't have any phone numbers for you to transfer the caller to.  It was ridiculous & I'm embarrassed that I wasted my time with them.  I got up out of there."
good,"Requires you to be at your desk. required to make all meetings even if you have two scheduled at the same time. All upper management was replace in the department. "
good,I worked at ally for 5 years but recently a lot has changed with management so I quit. It was a hard decision but it wasn’t fair on how the recent management came in. We work with another site in Fort Washington which is the main location for the bank but it seemed like a lot of favoritism was going on and no opportunity to grow. Seems as if they blocked better opportunities for you
good,"Salary is not based on performance and experience."
good,"Lots of indirect micro management and favoritism at the shoreview operation made it stressful to work here. hard-working people here usually end up getting frustrated or quitting because of minimal room for growth and a lot of inconsistencies in management. Your day to day can change drastically depending on who you report to. and since they cycle the team leads every few months or so.. this means different kpis, metrics and new favorites depending how well you rub with your boss. I could go on and on.. but to summarize my couple of yrs here: Great company with great benefits, but very low pay (was offered job paying 30% more for similar work) and poor management at this particular office. Not a place to stay long term if you value consistent learning and growth"
good,"In the division that I worked in, we had mandatory overtime and it was a non negotiable that you work almost every Saturday, although you were not hired to work weekend.. Management was not understanding of work/life balance."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"This was a hustle position of selling, it taught me confidence... how to approach strangers and make them fall in love with your product/services. It was a Loan Officer position."
good,"Evaluated borrower’s financial condition to prepare strategies in case of nonpayment of debt. Customer service experience solving and analyzing customer problems."
good,During my time at Ally Financial it was a somewhat revolving door.  The teams I worked with were very knowledgeable but there was not much support from the Management team.
good,"Fast paced, driven, relentless, redundant, unrealistic expectations, oppressive, poor morale, unwise practices and strategies for reaching customers, very demanding place to work"
good,"Good place to work.Lots to learn. good work cultures and environment"
good,"the job wasn't the best with a finance degree but the people whom I worked with, my coworkers, that made my day enjoyable."
good,"I learned a lot about working on loans and working with the customers that are angry trying to work and keep up with customers files , training others and making sure you help other team with there problems was a hard part of the day . I liked the job because it keep you busy and make the day going by fast . I learned how to plan my day and get the work done in a timely and accurate manner ."
good,Ally was an ok company to work for. The whole time I was there I never really learned what the company had to offer. Lack of leadership skills and advancement.
good,"Ally pays well but is hamstrung by a technophobic workforce and old mindset. The employees are not very diverse, and the longer one stays, the more likely they are to be beaten into thinking like the vast majority of the managers there, i.e. don't take risks and do whatever the policy manual says."
good,"This company has an old school attitude, not open to change or updating something that has worked since 1980's. Will not put money into technology. But is very family friendly - if you need to take time off, they are completely supportime"
good,overall this job is great for a person with no outside life
good,Not the best company a few good in the management however job security wasn’t a thing and we got laid of with a 1 day notice after working there for a year and a half.
good,"Working in Collections, there is a bit of a honeymoon period. After that, you get the feeling that your own co-workers are after you. Sometimes, you're right in assuming that."
good,this company pays okay the work load is stressful and management is very poor they only care about the company.work to life balance is not good at least once a week you work until 9 at night
good,Over all the work experience here is wonderful and very competitive.There is always support and many people including management that are will to see you produce and grow in your field.
good,"Ally Bank contracted with Global Respone, so technically, I worked for Global Response. "
good,"The management of the company does not care about the employees or the customers. Their policies are designed to squeeze as much productivity out of both as possible in terms of revenue. I have no problem with this, my issue is that they refuse to admit that. they will tell you to 'put the customer first' despite policies clearly designed to exploit them. If you can 'read between the lines' and figure out what management really wants it's not a bad job. If you desire an honest and open work culture; avoid at all costs."
good,"Like the title says.  Senior Management will hinder advancement through micro management.  If you don't mind being micro managed, this is the place for you.  However, if you want to learn skills and advance, you have to do it outside of business hours."
good,"The department Dealer services needs work, its a relatively new department, but it has many flaws that needs work. You are required to fulfill cases while answering the phone (even though there is a whole department for that) it not, your numbers will dip."
good,The pay for this job is very low for all the task that will be assigned to you. The company morale is high but it's hard to be so upbeat when you aren't making enough money.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,It is a decent place to work. They compensation and benefits could be a little better but all in all they are fairly good. Most of the people are friendly as well.
good,I think I just want more. Not a very enjoyable place to work at. I think management smiles but want to make it more like a sweatshop everyday. Good luck
good,"They monitored every second of every day.  You have to clock in on 3 different applications and you have to constantly be typing or you will questioned.  they do have a good culture, respect differences, and embrace diversity. The work was easy and the pay was manageable."
good,Ally does little to build teams like sponsoring employee events and the organization runs very lean so  you work very hard and always have a heavy workload.
good,"No comment. Overall , good place to work. Please be prepared to work in fast pace environment. Company number driven, which is expected. Overall, good place to work."
good,ok to work at.  Call center for automotive claims.  You will learn a lot about GM vehicles while working at this location.  The is a location where you make your own success.
good,"Ally provides great satisfaction for people that like to contribute in a continuous improvement environment. There are always things that need to improve and opportunities to get involved. Accomplishments are recognized and appreciated."
good,Ally is a place where you meet wonderful new people. the schedule is  perfect and set and the pay is good...BUT management will make you absolutely hate your job with a passion. They make it like it is  high school all over again. Micro managers and very childish. They will drain you metally the entire time and make you hate every good thing about it.they make the bad out weigh the good
good,"Stressful call center, back to back call, non stop all day.  Pay is low and I highly feel it should be raised by 3+ dollars and hour.  I would not pro-actively recommend this job."
good,Ally seems to be unsure of what it wants to be when it grows up. It has waivered several times on whether or not it wants to be in the mortgage business. A lot of the systems and processes are immature.
good,Has a lot of legacy problems in tech related to its heavy reliance on auto loans.  As a result a lot of the technology is old and hard to use.  Many systems are 10+ years old.
good,"Information Technology is too process driven.  Old and archaic processes drive the way things are done within IT."
good,"Pros- Able to work from home and good compensation. Great people working the trenches. Great comradery with co-workers. "
good,"sadly, it is farmed out to ACS.  they will work with you for school, but demand you to work. hard to get promoted or raises.  they hire college grads with no life experience.  the numbers are hard to hit."
good,everyday feels like youre walking on egg shells. every other day you would hear that your job is on the line or you will be written or it is considered as being insuborination
good,"worked here for a short time and loved the athmosphere , however I could not work afternoon shift as I did not drive at the time and couldn't be finished work as late as 1 am or 2 am and continuously scheduled me for these shifts so I had no choice but to find new work"
good,"Our team specializes in escalated calls and issues from dealerships that call in for help, when other agents are unable to help them. We process the documents they request within a 1-2 hour timeframe.  My co-workers are the best at what we do, we normally meet our goal because everyone stays on task and works as a team to get the database clear."
good,"People"
good,"Ally Canada was bought by RBC.  Consequently, the site I worked at eventually shut down."
good,"A monoline auto-finance company.  Probably a takeover target by a big bank, or possible repurchase by GM."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"I have learned many different skills at Ally However ,only because I was always asking to learn and when asking didn't work I would figure out the task on my own .  "
good,all the employees except for some managers really had each others back. The working relationships were pretty cool. Although shift bidding was extremely stupid
good,This was a 3 month contract position for a project launching soon. The work load was fine. We were on mandatory overtime so we worked every weekend.  The management team was ok at times.
good,It's good to work with Ally. It is a nice env but pay less and standard env. They won't convert good employees to full because of the Visa stautus. I think they need think on that.
good,"Overall they make there employees work environment clean and friendly. They give back to there employees with gifts, food and or small events. It’s overall a nice place to work and feel comfortable."
good,"My experience with Ally was at least interesting.  "
good,Good Benefits and salary. Some lower level management is aggressive and uses bullying tactics to achieve their goals.   My lower level management during my last 2 years was not good.  They minimized everything I did and they were two of the worst leaders I've experience in 29 years of working in IT.   Looking forward to the next opportunity where the leadership acknowledges your hard work.
good,"Company culture is changing, much more ridged,  eliminated the any opportunity to work from home on occasion.Training is available but usually on your own time... not built into the day"
good,"I am an outside sales rep for SmartAuction, an online wholesale automotive re-marketing site. A typical day constitues, administrative work early in the morning, then customer visits throughout the day. The biggest challenge of the job is having patience for all of the layers of this large organization. I love the autonomy of being an outside sales rep."
good,"I was at Ally during a period of major change, and the company was largely a disorganized mess.  Tons of politics, turf wars, and bad decision-making by unqualified management.  I was hired for a job that didn't even exist anymore when I showed up 2 weeks later, and was given another that was a poor fit for my background and skills.  "
good,"My job function and responsibilities were changed 3 times in the initial 90 days of employment. Job title changed, but new responsibilities were never outlined."
good,There is little to no rom for advancement. Also advancements is all about who you know not what you know. Pay could be much better and systems are so outdated.
good,"It was a great job, management made it hard to enjoy the job, there was a lot of favoritism. And you had to wait almost 2 years before you could advance in the company."
good,"Laid back environment, work from home flexibility, able to work independently, one on one shadowing, flexible training, benefits, paid time off, friendly environment."
good,"Not a bad place as long as you are not looking to advance your career. There is no reward or opportunity to go above and beyond. "
good,Micro management at its best. Management is clueless and not trained in the ins and outs of the department. No one knows anything. Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. To be promoted or to be in favor of upper management MUST kiss up and  give up your co workers.
good,"Worked at Ally Bank (previously GMAC Rescap) for almost 5 years. It was a fun company, training was not extensive, good benefits but like most companies, no job security."
good,Spacious location and able to collaborate with associates while assisting customers. Options for different departments so that you can provide specialized assistance.
good,"I worked at this place for three years, and learned quite a bit during my time there. The only thing I do not regret about working here is the fact that I gained experience to take my skills elsewhere, for ""promotions"" at Ally are almost always lateral only, and compensation is rarely given for ""promotions"". When mid-year and annual year reviews are being completed, management looks for any minuscule reason to not provide a bonus and/or raise to an employee. Schedules are based on a shift bid every three months. High call volume. High stress environment. Micromanagement is very common with this company."
good,"This company merged with Nuvell Financial out of Bedford, TX. Both companies had pretty much the same style; laid back and willing to help with anything! The hardest parts of the job were the commute and long work hours."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"Very disorganized, no equal career opportunities. Lack of confidentially and help. Environment on the call floor is not clean and as not been cleaning since finish building, which causing many people to sick and get getting bit by insects. Account manager very threaten when it comes to ones job. A lot intimidation that is place among st most of the hard working team managers and agents due not be liked by the account manager and HR department."
good,Forever Changing day to day.  No true sense of direction which caused confusion and distain among employees
good,"Ally Bank is a popular online bank among people seeking strong rates and robust customer service. Because it doesn’t have to put money into physical branches, Ally is able to offer better rates and fees than brick-and-mortar institutions and can invest more in its products."
good,You’re treated like a number and unless your management you are kept in the dark and only spoken to when you do something wrong and management loves to throw you under the bus
good,Antiquated computer programing used for accounts.  If your familiar with DOS you will do well. Friendly environment/working conditions but can be loud at times (other associated talking on the ph).  Opportunities to cross train into other departments.
good,"The micromanaging is the worst. They monitor what you’re doing on your computer. There are unrealistic performance metrics. Relaxed dress code. Little room for advancement. The culture is very “employee vs management” attitude. They give you a decent amount of time off but have to request time off basically a year in advanced. If you use one of your PTO days when you are too sick to come to work, it will count against your performance as “unscheduled day off.” Management is not supportive of the employee, they are very lazy. It’s a very childish atmosphere, at least that’s how you’re treated. It’s almost comical - looking back at how I even used to work there."
good,"I worked for Ally for 3 years and enjoyed working there as the culture and employee rewards / activities was exciting, along with most of the managers / supervisors were younger, so very easy to talk to and get a long with. The only bad thing I would say is that working in the call center can be very demanding and stressful, must be willing to be patient and stay busy constantly. And while they do promote within, only to the ""favorites"". I was always getting looked over for raises and promotions over other employees, although I did well on all measures / metrics and customer service excellence."
good,"Ally is a non-captive finance lender that was once a captive lender (formerly GMAC). "
good,"Good place to work."
good,"I was very passionate about my role at Ally and enjoyed carrying out my responsibilities."
good,the environment is stressful and must be able to manage the different departments.  the enjoyable part of the job is working in a pmo environment and learning new skills
good,"Coming out from GM as its financial arm called as GMAC, Ally was cumbersome with several layers of management, which made its operation inefficient and costly.  This was 5 years ago, and hope the situation new is improved."
good,On the surface Ally is great. Once you work there its different. The upper management is terrible.  The benifits are great. The pay is less then average.
good,"There are a lot of function to learn at ally financial, which would help build your resume and hands on experience. The ability to learn multiple functions are available."
good,"8- 5 hours , micro managers heavily. If your not a favorite with management, you get stuck in your position with no room to move departments.  Managers don't know how to manage if they don't have reporting."
good,Hours are unreal!!! Expected to work 7 days a week. Be prepared to be asked to work every Saturday and possibly Sunday and comp time out on Tues or Wed so they don't have to pay you overtime!!!
good,Ally is a nice reputable company to work for. The company has great benefits and a great working environment but compensation and room for advancement may be lacking.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,Management is not always on the same page. Workplace culture is alright. The hardest part of the job is no consistency. The most enjoyable part is quitting time.
good,This was a pleasant working environment for contractors.  Never felt like you were a contractor but felt like a FTE.  Good people.  Fast-paced work. Benefits could be better.
good,"Learned a lot while employed here, because I had a manager who encouraged knowledge seeking. There was a culture of politics and bullying that did not allow for advancement based on merits."
good,"Good work/life balance but challenging environment/culture.  Flat organization, somewhat difficult to advance.  Many leaders do not have a lot of leadership experience, were brought in or promoted based on previous relationships versus actual skills.  Leadership doesn't make logical decisions."
good,"I loved this job.  Until..  I noticed people were being promoted not on merits but because of who they knew or hung out with outside of work.  I was told,  I would never advance because someone didn't like me in the call center.  Even tho I had more than 8 months of perfect quality,  chat training,  IRA,  etc.  ."
good,"I sat at a desk all day and answered phone calls. It wasn't the worst job, but I would much rather be out doing something a little more physical."
good,"Ally Financial - overall is a challenging place to work - weak management, very poor training for existing employees - you really have to know how and to obtain new procedures on your own.  Lots of complicated software an multitasking involved. Very poor in compensation advancement if any.  I would not recommend this company to any of my friends or family for employment.   Lots of threats of being written up or terminated for minor incidents.   Moral very low at this company.  I like working there because I can ignore and  focus on my job responsibilities and usually end up learning something new every day. ."
good,Company has been downsizing due to government ownership and the need to do an initial public offering to pay back the governement
good,"> Monitor various Salesforces queues to ensure Deposit Operations customer request were being addressed timely and accuratley. Providing customers with statements and correspondence. Reviewed Reg CC holds and mailing of  the Notice of Delayed Availabilty so customers were educate when their deposits were available for use."
good,The job used to be of good interest but as management change so did the job perks
good,All days are busy with changes happening across the organization
good,Good place to work but have a few things to work out. The company was still relatively on its infancy and management didn't have it all together. Colleagues/Coworkers were great. Quality and talented people
good,i liked my job but i didnt like the way the system and managment worked
good,The company was okay I got promoted while I was working there. I enjoyed working at Ally I was able to get another type of work under my belt which made me more diverse
good,Management is supportive and employee friendly. Opportunity is available at Ally as long as you keep a positive attitude and continue to learn the business
good,"Nothing special about working there, just your average collections job. Felt the job was fair and work hours were sufficient.  Pay could have been better."
good,very low stress company based on other related companies.  good company to start your professional career.  the salary is very low.  the benefits are decent.
good,Generated list of aging accounts receivables older than 1 month & submitted to A/R department. Posted entries in leading G/L account as well as corresponding journal entries.
good,"Must alternative late shift hours to 9pm. Fun place to work depending on your supervisor. In the car business, and dealing directly with dealership employees keeps the job interesting."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,The company as a whole is fine.  there are just subsets that are very dramatic and cause more issues than necessary.   It is expected that people work overtime
good,"When I started at Ally I felt positive about the work environment, but the longer I spent there the worse my experience became. I started as a CSR on the phones, but I was moved to a more specialized position shortly after starting. I was recently moved back to a phone-heavy position, which I did not ask for, while still being expected to perform my specialized job duties.  Management has also been reluctant to grant appropriate accommodations for my condition. They decided to start training me in another field, only to change their minds without telling me. I was very excited to move into that new decision, and I felt I was blatantly lied to about why I was no longer being considered."
good,"A good place to start a career, great people, learning opportunities, advancements, marketing, audits, banking, customer service, customer relations, engagement skills"
good,They hype the job up so much to the poimt you think you were getting into something good. Until you start doing the job and realized the training didnt all go tog
good,"For the most part, my experience was positive.  Only issues were management allowing extremely unprofessional behavior from employees that created an unproductive/aggressive work environment."
good,"job was outsourced overseas, we  had  the  option  to relocate,  but   at  our  own  expense ,   started  to  become  a  micromanaging  company  to  avoid  paying  unemployment"
good,I really enjoyed the staff at Ally.  The people are very friendly. Once in a while they would have company lunches to celebrate a website launch which is great.
good,The benefits offered with being an employee at Ally are awesome. Being able to care for your family without having to worry about which doctors office is out of network is definitely a stress reliever.  The company as a whole is very competitive with little training and often unrealistic expectations.
good,Ally is a comfortable place to work. You can learn a lot of you have not have the experience of banking.  New location so manager are very hand on with  employees on the floor of the call center. Call center is a diverse group. Meeting customers needs is the best reward of the job.
good,"Worked in a very thin staff environment.   "
good,"Ok place to work at. Easy to maintain work-life balance. Pay was low but good for those just starting their careers. Hours were pretty standard, 9-5 or 7-4."
good,"Great people and great environment to work in.Great Benefits. "
good,"They are changing the online banking landscape with innovative digital experiences with, 24/7 customer service, great rates and rewarding credit and lending products.

good,It was great if you are under the right management that will push you to do better . Its all about having a good support system that supports your career at ally
good,"They need improvement on how they treat their employees, but could be a good place to work. The professionalism is not the same across the board, this could be one area of improvement."
good,Ally provides a pleasant work experience and like many companies has some good and some less good elements. Overall the culture is positive and the goals are progressive.
good,Management was in flux while I worked there.  Company was in a rebuilding mode with difficult compliance issues.  It was a multi-year process to bring the company to the current strong position.
good,"I learned quite a bit in my last position with Ally, but the team morale was almost non-existent and very stressful. The hardest part of the job was that there was a high turnover rate in the department, but the most enjoyable thing was gaining knowledge and getting acquainted with various parts of the business. Every file was different. I also enjoyed assisting the customers and making a difference on their behalf."
good,Would have stayed if didnt move out of town. Good incentives at the company. Friendly people to work with. Had a wonderful supervisor that helped me alot.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"a typical day was on the phone all day, did learn about auto industry management is cut throat the most enjoyable part of the job was some of my co workers"
good,Ally was a good place to work during my time there. We successfully transformed from an auto finance company to expanding into the largest online bank.
good,"staff is friendly easy to work with. Can be frustrating have to use multiple systems on one computer screen or when systems are either down and slow while assisting customers who are in a hurry. to reach the bonus you'd have to have a good average score thats graded by the quality team. lunch and breaks are separated about 2 hrs apart. if you don't mind taking calls after calls, calls can range from 30-1hr , each day then it be a perfect fit."
good,"Ally financial has great management staff with a open door policy."
good,"We were promised a commission plan to be effective February 1st. By the time i left in September, there was still was no commission plan in effect and it was no longer being mentioned. Many team members left because they couldn't afford to work there any longer."
good,"I worked as a contractor for a special project (4 - 6 month), they were unable to bring in enough people and delayed the project and terminated the contract early."
good,"I aquired a lot of knowledge during the time I was on this temporary assignment., I would recoment this Administrative position for any intern entering the workforce. Great opportunity"
good,Ally was a great entry job for a finance career you learn a lot about financing cars and everything that goes into it. met plenty of great people and made friends
good,"Over 8 years collection experience using list of accounts."
good,"The bank itself has many kinks that still need to be worked out, which can make it difficult to work there.  It is a good company to work for though, with many benefits."
good,"•	Perform call monitoring and provide trend data to the site management team."
good,"•	Handle credit applications for Lease and Retail auto loans to determine credit worthiness"
good,great place to start and move up the corporate ladder.  Not very much movement to move up in the company but can be great to get experiences. Learn great skills
good,Ally is working on improving its work culture and bettering relationships between management and team members.  The compensation package is more than competitive
good,"Great corporation to work for. Ally Financial Inc., previously known as GMAC Inc. (an acronym for General Motors Acceptance Corporation), is an American bank holding company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States."
good,"A typical day would be very busy, fast, and quick. I very much enjoyed working there. The management team and supervisors are also very friendly and approachable. "
good,It is an ok place to work. Limited advancement for field employees. Managers are disconnected from reality at times for sales expectations. Vacation time is decent.
good,steady pay check hard work little reward overall easy come work leave come again. its like High school office drama and not safe to make friends. very easy to get demoted
good,when i worked at dollar tree my store manager was awesome but now the manager there is not good. when i worked there i had awesome co-workers that i got along fine with. the hardest part was getting everything settle for inventory. the most enjoyable part working there was helping customers find what they needed.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans.

good,I have learned a lot of the finance industry working for Ally and the different departments I've entered.
good,"Even if you lead performance within your workgroup, if you are not one of the chosen few or 'favored' employees, you'll have a hard time making meaningful advancement."
good,"Handled escalated calls.   "
good,"Ally Financial Inc had a great environment to work in."
good,Ally was very competitive and fast pace. very structured but at times it made you very repetitive in your daily job. Could have done more for your employees.
good,Ally tends to do more with less.  There are frequent cut-backs at year-end due to budgetary constraints.  Most employees have 10 or less years with the company due to these cut-backs.  High seniority employees are typically targeted due to their salary.
good,"High Moral, friendly environment to work in"
good,Work was tedious but the jobs were rotated every week so you didn't have to do the same thing every day but it was still tedious. Job security was questionable often. There were constant rumors that my department was closing.
good,"Great place to network and learn new things.  Competitive and Fast past environment, very numbers driven, hands on training for new hires - there's no training class or manual. Overall great place to work."
good,"A day at Ally was typically uneventful, but very busy. Ally works under a very slim profile, and has a very small workforce for each of their controls."
good,"This place is good I worked on the commercial side, and it seemed very disorganized and not structured. I heard the people on the consumer side loved it but once you are in Commercial they do everything they can not to let you leave because no one wants to be in on that side."
good,Data entry and verification of legal documents to current database information. All coded correctly and match legal guidelines.
good,Furnishing credit history to credit bureaus.  The hardest part of the job is the mental strain and changes.
good,"Good company, good benefits, bonus structure and salary too low."
good,"The healthcare benefits are pretty good and the expense of it is about average nationally.  "
good,"As the company went through different changes, I.E. changing names and claiming bankruptcy before being bought by Ocwen, a lot of the upper management left and was replaced by offsite employees that we never met and rarely even knew their names. It got to the point we weren't kept in the loop of anything from new products to policy changes. They are now moving all the IT jobs to India at the end of the year, leaving us without jobs."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is my co-workers, working together as a team. I have learn from my team lead and managers."
good,"A typical day for me consists of the review/audit of numerous funded contracts to ensure compliance with company and government guidelines, policies, and procedures. I have learned to hone in on my detail-oriented skills and triple check my work if necessary. The management for the most part is willing to assist you in doing your job well. I enjoy my co-workers and their collective knowledge. The hardest part of the job is not second-guessing my judgment. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I can make a difference for the company."
good,We process approximately 125k contracts a month. I would rather not say anything further.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"Organization is a right fit if you are hard-working, dedicated, and embrace change readily."
good,"Supportive Staff."
good,"Fun place to work, great management/co-workers. would work there again or recommend someone to the company"
good,"When I say non-professional I mean not requiring a specific degree or education.  #'s driven and not too bad on bonus opportunity.  Favoritism is evident but it is everywhere.  Management is good, personable at times.  Not really too much micromanagement.  Job becomes redundant after 1-2 years.  Very pleasant location(West Little Rock)!!!  "
good,"Utilized different applications on a daily basis to complete tasks. Managed the Exception Processing team. Worked side by side with the Fraud team, Electronic banking, Pended applications, Trust and Wires. I enjoyed multi tasking and leading the team. Also, the interaction with customers and third party vendors."
good,One a daily bases my resposibility was to help customers and save losses. Discuss options available to customer to be secure in auto.
good,nothing to add work environment fine. The job was designed to accomdate the collection of funds on automobiles behind in payment. Thus customer service through phone contact
good,"I started with Ally when it was GMAC and had some really great opportunities to grow and to manage. I spent 12 years in Sales, 3.5 years as an Underwriter, 16 years managing employees and teams. Spent 1.5 years reviewing dealership financial statements. Was on an accelerated program to take me into management for 1 year and spent 2.5 years in collections."
good,"After changing the CIO Management get versed so much monopoly and bad cultured and too much favoritism for the loved ones & buttering peoples, layoffs resources for nonreasons."
good,"Great pay and solid benefits but expect many 50+ hour weeks, and consistent after hours/weekend work. Some legacy attitudes from the GM days remain, a stark contrast to the advertised corporate culture from the highest executive level employees.  However, like all large enterprises, it all depends on your direct executive leadership and their management philosophy. This varies widely from group to group."
good,"I had previous knowledge from banking experience but was shocked by the amount of different software programs that I had to quickly learn to use and the endless variety of cases.  I love the concept of Ally and I do believe it is wonderful bank that cares about its customer's and makes tremendous efforts in improving online banking."
good,"Good working hours and overtime if needed. Poor management in certain departments. Allow you to work in different departments, if needed. No more commments!"
good,"I worked at the company for 3 years and while it is a great company to work for, there are no chances for advancement. The management is not steady, and as a result, there are constant changes with the management. Due to the constant changes within management, the company doesn't feel it is stable enough to promote other employees until the management is established and finalized."
good,"There are opportunities that exist within Ally. Overall the work done is not innovative and repetitive. I would describe the company culture in the Atlanta office as unorganized and a revolving door. The office is in a poor location in Duluth and immensities are non existent. There are better cultures and job opportunities in other cities. The company's profits rely too strongly on risky loans. They have diversified not because they feel there is a need, but because core business is under performing."
good,"Ally is working hard to define itself.  As the offshoot of GMAC, Ally's culture was forced to change.   The former GMAC management, though strong,  was not chosen to lead the company into the future.  It will be interesting to see how it develops."
good,"Ally is a make or break environment.  I feel your manager will really set the tone for your advancement as well as exit opportunities to internal opportunities.  Ally is very political, but the pay and benefits are overall very comfortable and don't be suprised if others feel threatened if you are a well-educated and intelligent individual."
good,"A typical day at work was busy.  I answered the phones, managed calendars and prepared travel arrangements.  I updated budget information.  I reviewed the executives emails and made sure all priorities were taken care of or responded to.  Also made sure everyone on the team was taken care of."
good,"Its was a Laid back environment in general, but ITIL process needs to be in proactive more across all departments"
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"I worked here for almost 5 years at the Lewisville office.  My pet peeve are the computer applications which, in my opinion, are redundant. Too many manual processes which could be automated thus reducing human error.  As a result, a lot of emphasizes is on QC to scrutinized every manual process.  You would think with the legal ramification of our processes that Ally would have more safeguards built into their computer systems and make the system talk to one another more and lessen the manual aspect which increase human error.  Ally prides itself as a learning organization.  But, it is sink-or-learning or baptism-by-fire training. Everything is not covered when shadowing someone not even in the L&D classroom trainings.  They only give overviews.  You learn through opportunities which mean you must make a mistake before  being aware how it is done.  That mistake goes on QC reports and become part of your performance. I don't think that is fair. In my dept. profanity and unprofessional, immature behavior, favoritism is tolerated.  I am looking for re-employment elsewhere. Also, being unstaffed is a constant but never acknowledged."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ally, however, there is limited room for advancement. Also, since the government is an owner there has become a significant amount of ""red tape""."
good,"Good working environment and was able to experience different projects, Team size was moderate and had a high scope of learning. Had a wonderful working experience."
good,Its a great company to work for but the poor management draws from it. I truly enjoyed the time I worked here but the lack of good leadership would make me not want to work here again
good,"Promotion, pay increases very political. Nepotism culture. Employees get into unposted positions. Slow computers, unstructured processes is frustrating."
good,A typical day at work just depends. There's an opportunity to work in many different areas of the company. Great benefits and pay. Can use more work-life balance.
good,"Good Pay, Good People, Lots of Work.  Auto Finance Division still has strong influence from old GMAC FS culture which created a more family like atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work. they really do care about their employees. Great pay, great benefits. Great work culture. No issues with the company. Now that Ally has become a Bank, employees now get federal holidays off."
good,Small annual raises. Good culture. Tedious work. There were a few managers that were terrible to their employees and upper management never did any thing about it.
good,"The job itself was managed alright, the dress code was kind of ridiculous but made sense. The atmosphere and bonuses were terrible though, as it is a very depressing job, but the pay was okay and it is a good job if you want something that's easy and no labor. Before I got the job I was told I can work full-time Monday to Friday but i ended up with only a few choices after training and had to take a shift that was 2:30-11PM and the lunches were not paid."
good,"This is an ok company to work for, considering I've been with the company for 8 years.  There is always potential for improvement, though the company seems to be slowly making a shift towards integrating fresher ideas."
good,"Great place, great culture, and the company constantly finds new ways to implement a work life balance. It's almost like a big family, the company takes care of their employees"
good,Ally is growing fast and sees the need for diversity in middle and upper management. This can lead to holding on the unqualified persons with personality defects who would be kicked to the curb if they did not improve the diversity balance sheet.
good,"I loved Ally and would recommend the job for those who don't have kids. Was a very fun place to work and very competitive, but they have multiple unrealistic goals. They really don't show concern for outside family life unless its medically approved for a leave."
good,"A positive work environment that makes you feel good when you come to work. Motivation is provided to help you sustain, and obtain daily goals. A stable work environment built on trust,growth, and development."
good,"Pay is horrible compared to competitors. The Job culture environment is pretty cool. The employment engagement team along with Ally do put together activities, days, and events for the employees to enjoy."
good,Ally is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and love having fun with employees to celebrate goals that were reached.
good,"Its a good company but some things seem a little unfair, ceo's are great but some management tend to show favoritism, seem unorganized"
good,"Working for Ally bank has been an educational and eye-opening experience. I would have never expected to work a compnay like this one, but I am happy to have had the chance to."
good,Great environment with a lot of opportunities for growth!  Open Business Meetings with involvement from all levels.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"If you don't mind micro management and working all weekends, then this is a great place to work. Management is competent enough, the job can be stressful."
good,Would import 500 accounts daily and assign them to the team. Worked closely with our vendors. Sent out transport requests. Reviewed and resolved inspection errors. Researched and reviewed waiver errors by associates. Coded funds received to correct departments. Applied funds to customer accounts. General office duties.
good,"I love working at Ally Financial! We have great benefits and the culture within the company is awesome. They want to keep you and ensure you get all the training needed to advance. If you desire advancement, be sure to work hard and remain professional and you will definately get promoted."
good,Great benefits and compensation. I did enjoy working with my teams I was a part of. I didn't enjoy actually being a Collector. It made my job a bit stressful.
good,"Ally has a good structure and i have many friends that have worked there for years. I left the company due to life changes within the probational period, however Ally is a stable company who is willing to train and develop employees who are willing to work for their goals."
good,Over all if you do not like production jobs you will not like this.  If you can not handle calling someone asking them to find a way to barrow money to pay your car note when they have been laid off or lost there job this is truly not for you.
good,"Ally is going through a lot of changes right now (2/2014).  Overall it's an okay place to work.  The comp and benefits are above the market average.  It can take forever to get decisions made at the upper level and subsequently it delays project deliverables.  Recent resource reduction has increased the workload even more for many that already had ""full plates."""
good,This is a pretty good company with room to be the best. One thing they need to care for their employees a little more.
good,"For the most part, it is a fast-paced environment. A lot of driven people. Overall, whatever department you interview for, the work isn't that hard but it can be challenging at times."
good,"Very fast paced, high call volume, always new polices rolling out weekly that you need to enforce. Calls are monitered and graded weekly. Little training"
good,No comment at this time.  My first 13 years were great but my last two years were not good in the QC department.
good,"20 days PTO, early hours (for me), friendly co workers, Manager is laid back and cool, great location (not much traffic), pay is decent."
good,Ally Bank is a good company to work for  but need more chance to advance no growth in the company.Need to expand more in the network and and pay more bonus
good,"Ally financial is very good project for the Automobile Financial project."
good,"Ally was great before it went under. I worked here for over 3 years, right when it started going down, and I had the opportunity to get out."
good,"Great Place to work. Attendance is Key! time each and every day, and your job will be safe. Learn to talk to people and ask as many questions as you can."
good,"a typical work day busy, always on the phone with customers."
good,this company was a good place to work. The environment wasn't that great but the work was organized and manageable. The hardest part of the job was just learning and keeping up with all the continuous changes that were been made.
good,"A great entry level place to learn the corporate environment. management styles differ greatly across departments. Pay is low, but other benefits are pretty good."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"Laid back company. Depending on the department management is easy to communicate with, the culture is family like. The hardest part of the job was knowing there were limited opportunities to advance."
good,Ally Auburn Hills was a very good locations across from Chrysler Tech Center.  This company is very diverse everyone working very well from all levels of the company including upper management.
good,Everyday there is always something new to learn. I am always ready to learn new task and build together collectively with my team in my department. My typical day at work is very challenging and fast past.
good,I liked the job itself. Struggled with immediate supervisor as others in the department under her. Had hard time with structure of clock in time.  Wish would  have had a different supervisor most likely still been there.
good,"Better work environment than most banks."
good,Never dull always something to do. Unrealistic goals based on the facts that the company’s rates are not competitive/comparable to other banks especially the credit unions in the market. Management constantly sought feedback but rarely acted on feedback nor provide much support. Pay and benefits are excellent however you will be asked to work 6-7 days per week
good,"How comfortable can you really be on someone else job? Meaning how happy can you really be many a company millions of dollars and you only see 16.50 an hour."
good,Management doesn't shoot straight with employees.  Hiring discussion with HR wasn't what occurred once employed.  Managers become too busy to be available for employees and don't share details or offer needed feedback.
good,"Some departments are short-staffed and causing workload issues and low morale which was often overlooked by management or not handled properly.  Poor communication between out-of-state branches and departments. "
good,"Overall the work experience at Ally was mediocre. The job consisted of call center duties in which I learned various procedures in finance of vehicles and providing dealers and finance managers with payout/buyout quotes. The management could have been more hands on and provided more career building opportunities. The culture was good among the employees; however, the constant changing of schedules and seating designations within the office didn't make for a stable work environment. The hardest part of the job was the monotony of the job duties. There was no opportunity to learn new skills that may enhance job marketability. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with dealers, finance managers and fellow employees to accomplish set goals."
good,"Co-Workers were great! Due to the crash of the financial markets in 2008, with half of the staff being layed off the fall of 2009 the management was always in crisis mode."
good,"I like working for Ally, they are good at laying out targets for your workload."
good,"Good work/life balance, the benefits are great also!  However, the companies outlook/job security is not the greatest."
good,"The people really do care about doing a good job and it shows.  It is a little vanilla for people that really want to archieve, but still a good place to start."
good,"Its a fun place to work, however I am a new mom & I feel I dont get much time with my baby during the week due to the late days once a week & the  4 hour shift once a month on Saturdays & also some of the team leads can be horrible to the point where you want to quite"
good,"Ally was a great place to work lots of fun, turnover was a bit to much .and the layoffs were not good.  management was very good very helpful and the training was good as well"
good,"Work with good people. Do a lot for less fortunate in community. Managers are not consistent, they have favorites. Rules do not apply to everyone. I never had problems,  just some observations I made."
good,"Ally was a good place to work, great potential to move up, hours change and friendly people. believe in team concepts. core values . customer service atmosphere"
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,Too many rules for an open minded person who likes to think outside the box.
good,Leading automotive financial services company powered by a top direct banking franchise
good,Good field to be in if you want to move toward a financial field.
good,"a typical day at work"

good,"Excellent Training"
good,Good place to work. Nice co-workers. Great growth potential
good,"I really do enjoy my job but since our hours changed, it makes it difficult to take care of my family. My typical day is coming up with solutions to resolve issues customers, car dealerships or account executive may have with their vehicle accounts."
good,"Roles and Responsibilities:"
good,"Got a chance to work on Latest version of products and tools"
good,"Description: Dodge Migration - Ally applications migrated into new location due the GMAC take over Functional and Performance testing done on various applications (GAS, Global Functions, Mortgage, Bank, Tech & Ops)"
good, Analyzed the requirements and transformed them into System Requirements and validated with technical and business teams
good,On top of my basic administrative duties my job varies from day to day.
good,"Benefits package is desirable. No sick time, must use accrued PTO. Ally supports and encourages volunteer work outside the organization. They do their best to promote great work/life balance, and create a fun working environment."
good,"Ally was a good place to work, just wished they didn't move to Detroit. No onsite parking if you had less than 10 years with company, they did reimburse for ride share expenses. No opportunity for growth."
good,My managers were great. They allowed me to work with minimum supervision. My latest team was my favorite. We were a family. I miss the company dinners and team outings.
good,I started with Nuvell in 2003 and through the years we became GMAC and then Ally Finacial.   It was challenging and rewarding.  In that time I started as a collector and worked my way to operation manager.  Then on to supervise a commercial care team for the fleet sales division.
good,"good team, nice atmosphere and a great place to work."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans.

The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,Easy place to work as a contractor. The environment was laid back and easy-going. The company was going through growing pains and those were starting to show.
good,"I actually loved working for the company, the manager wasn't so pleasant. Good benefits and hours, The job was very easy and the environment was very pleasant."
good,Ally is a great company to work for. They believe in work life balance.  Ally also supports diversity.  The hardest part of the job is not knowing which volunteer opportunity to help with
good,Overall an enjoyable tenure with the company.  There is a lot of employee turn-over and there exist few opportunities for advancement.  The supervision and management are supportive however some upper management is not employee focused but more metrics mindset.  The health insurance and 401k program of the company is excellent.  A typical day at work is usually very stressful and over time is many times mandatory.  I was given the opportunity to learn in-depth about the industry of auto finance services and management did encourage growth and educational activities. The workplace culture was one of support by peers and the hardest part of the job was maintaining professionalism in a very high stress and dramatic work environment.
good,"a typical day at work can entail taking up to 100 calls incoming for customer service issues from simple to complex problems with auto accounts receivables. Most managers are solid assistants to their teams, some are not as at all places. I was in the escalations team and a regular day did take on some issues with customers who were very angry but after listening and offering to help, most calmed down. all calls are monitored and scores are given for efficiency and content per the call center guidelines for your department. The people who are on the teams I have worked for are all great. We have team building meetings and also fun activities for the sites."
good,"Regular 8-5 desk job, Data entry and phone calls, micromanaged, great benefits, team environment, mandatory overtime was the hardest part of the job most enjoyable being part of the employee engagement committee"
good,"Fast paced environment. Sometimes offered overtime. "
good,"I was employed there for 16 years and would have still been employed there if I hadn't relocated to California."
good,Competitive pay scale but company is slightly behind on technological collections tools.  Management also changes too often and many times aren't on the same page.
good,"The company was close to home, but the  pay was not good and the procedures in place to bonus was hard to overcome, the co workers were nice, manangement stuck together, and harderst part of job was getting customers to answer phone."
good,"In my experience it is a great company for anyone just starting out or trying to get back on their feet. There are challenges that you face but most of the day to day activity is pretty standard and repetitious. Overall would say if you need a place to work, this is a basic good step in the right direction kind of place."
good,"Large workloads with others not held accountable for their work assignments. No updated systems, work hours and work schedules are not flexible. No advancement with benefits, forced into lateral movement to other departments with no benefit."
good,"I enjoy working for GMAC-Ally Financial. Day is busy, I learn to be proactive and positive each and everyday. I work with some great people."
good,"A typical day at work with Ally Financial consist of being on the phone with customers collecting payments on past due accounts. My favorite part of the job is helping customers find a way to bring account current by offering assistance, if available and taking payment arrangements if customers are unable to bring account current. When I hear the relief on the other end of the phone after I help a customer, makes my day."
good,"Previous employee, many departments -  have management that have been placed in a role just because they have been there for a while, then lock them in. However one in particular was known to berate their employees mostly behind closed doors or within internal group team meetings. Person always looking for a fall person. Can't accept responsibility for their own actions and/or performance. Otherwise great company, mix of team and singular mentality."
good,"Good place to help customers in difficult financial situation, good bonus program and benefits"
good,I worked for Ally Bank six months ago. The job environment was very pleasant and friendly. This is a call center so like most the pace of the work flow was dependent upon the time of the day. Over all I would recommend working here if you’re comfortable with working independently and helping customers with their banking needs.
good,"Ally isnt a horrible place to work overall. They have great benifits and the work environment is chill for the most part. However, the management in dealer service sucked completely. Their was clearly racist in higher places(OM). Also they sell you on advancement after a year to only move you somewhere temporarily and being you back. Also your year end reviews were also manager driven. So if management wasnt fond of you then that ment NO BONUS!!!"
good,stressful but a great challenge for complex issues if you can just be yes person without causing a stir. Hardest part of the is just knowing there is no area for you to grow beyond your seat within the department
good,Didn’t like the shift bids. Management was great. They relocated out of state and didn’t pay for relocation. I learned a lot about dealers and the  Financial part of it.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,Ally was a great company wish they were still in Kansas. Still in business in other states and gave some employees chance to relocate.  Great upper management
good,"Good company to work for, management could allow other people to lead. career growth in the company is non existent. I was stuck in one area with no chance to advance because the leaders are settled into their positions."
good,"This job is great for someone coming out of college and needing some experience in a professional workplace. There are many bits and pieces you gather working at Ally that are necessary to succeed in a big business environment. "
good,"Not a bad place to work; team spirit high, high on diversity & inclusion, constant changes and sometimes lack of communication from the top to the bottom. Trust in Management is not strong"
good,"It was the first job for me as a tester,  everything is new for me and I enjoy it. But I was very nerves in my first day of job but all the team members was wonderful."
good,"Productive environment with great opportunity.  "
good,"I enjoyed working here due to the paid benefits, time off and bonuses. The environment was very competitive and fun. The culture is great and the people are very friendly."
good,Ally is a pretty decent place to work over all.  The best thing about the company were the benefits. Great 401-K and PTO.  Not a lot of job advancement opportunities.
good,I would recommend Ally to others as a place of long term employment.  The environment is friendly and the culture is very supportive.  The future for Ally is cutting edge.
good,"Love this company overall.  The current management in my department is lacking which has caused a need for downsizing and my position is being eliminated.  I enjoyed my years with this company and truly believe in their success and believe that overall they treat their employees fairly and have a great atmosphere.  I am upset that the recent changes in my department caused the need for me to be eliminated, because I would have stayed with the company for many years to come."
good,Company has been a place for Good Work life Balance. Enough opportunities to learn and grow. Diverse culture and respects values. I would recommend this place to work.
good,The employees are great. The workload is high. Employees are able to leave after 8 hours. Overtime is available for those willing to stay. Opportunities are available for promotion.
good,"The experience out there was very different. I learned to manage things like stress, pressure, targets and most importantly the customers. The process was well satisfying."
good,Management was easy to work with and provided constant training. The staff was very transparent about operations and created a friendly and amicable environment with a great open door policy.
good,"If you like being underpaid and performing in consistently understaffed departments than Ally is the place for you. Also, high school mentality is the norm."
good,"Good place to work, excellent benefits and bonuses. It is a good place for learning opportunities and classroom training."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment. it truly challenged me to work harder, all while still having fun."
good,"Ally is a great place to work, the main issue is the lack of upward mobility. There are a number of people with very long tenures without any inclination to move up or out, making it very difficult to be promoted."
good,Great place to work with opportunity for advancement and meeting new people.
good,"Very unsecure place to work, you never know when u loosing your job."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist.

good,"Breaks and Lunches are very strict."
good,"Team for the most part was very strong. Good opportunities to learn new tech."
good,"Diverse managers with varying desired vested interest in work.  Change management ongoing.  Role was completely remote, meetings were phone and Webex."
good,As a contractor except working I didn't participate in any other activities. My manager supported me very well in areas I didn't work earlier. Flexible work schedule.
good,When I worked at Ally Financial the environment was fun and engaging. My co-workers were all supportive and willing to assist. I just learned that collections was a field I was not going to excel at.
good,"Significant effort on IT maturity path, through improved process/tools.  "
good,Job was ok for the amount of pay. You have to answer inbound calls about car leases. I worked in the out bound department for the call center. I answered calls about auctions
good,"At the most senior levels of leadership the belief in the core values of Ally are strong.  This trickles down to most organizations, however, outside hiring from organizations that do not share these beliefs put this at risk.  As an insider I am seeing more and more risk to these core values.  "
good,"I love the services that were rendered to me here. very ethical and professional. human relation was excellent. colleagues were cordial and the manager was a leader, rather than a boss"
good,"Not a bad place to work, most of the positions are very high intensity. Culture is the biggest thing they care about. Very open relationships between agents and members of management"
good,"Overall experience excellent, learned a lot. I experienced professional growth while feeling continuously challenged to learn new techniques and the freedom to apply the same."
good,Found that the Management group could be Cliquey at times - could have been the group I was in. Other groups didn't seem to have that issue - so I can only speak to the group I worked in
good,"A Fortune 500 financial services firm (#286) provides automotive and mortgage financing, insurance, investment and online banking services.  Ally has won Best Online Bank awards for the last five years (GOBankingRates)"
good,"this environment is very diversity and we have people from the world. the work ethics is very calm and people are willing to help others.  -Work-Life Balance Guide for those looking for a more flexible position. We believe that it's important to understand the flexibity of a job or employer and comments about the ability to work remotely, flexibly and/or part-time are very important aspects of whether a job or company is desireable."
good,"Since I worked for ALLY through TekSystems. Helping to get their Data Center, up and running. They were very aware of my knowledge and abilities, before they interviewed me."
good,"Ally gives you 21 days of vacation plus paid holidays. After 3 years you get 3 additional vacation days.  The company gives you $750/yr towards your health savings account. They have many company events to show employee appreciation. The culture is very laid back. The only complaint I have is that if you're a really good employee, they won't allow you to move to other departments for selfish reasons."
good,"Fun environment, management was awesome, and encouraging, to move forward in my career. I was supported in my efforts to seek growth. However I didn't have much of a work family life balance."
good,We have a fierce commitment to:
good,I don't really have much to say. I met a lot good people working at  this company.. I feel that more opportunity for employees to move forward in company

good,Ally is a great company that genuinely cares about it's employees. They are continuously looking for fun ways to keep there team engaged.
good,There is room for growth within the company. I have been fortunate to start out as a dealer service specialist II and moving to a quality control analyst. I've had the ability to learn more about underwriting process of buying paper since moving to Quality Control. I enjoy my daily job duties and my interaction with employees throughout the company. My typical work day is auditing underwriting and contract processing. I have been fortunate to meet some really awesome people with this company. Overall it is a decent company to work for.
good,"Great place to work and very supportive Management. Plenty of audits, keeping up with all the changes in the infrastructure. Real good place for Teamwork."
good,Working at Ally has been a good experience so far. The employees and co-workers are very friendly. They offer great opportunities for advancement within the company and they are always creating ways to keep their customers and employees satisfied.
good,"Great company with a very good upper management. This company easily adapts to challenges & hurdles within the automotive market & expects its employees to follow suit into potential unknown territories within the market. You will work long hours as an underwriter/credit analyst including holidays, weekends, and late nights, but the trade-off is that the pay is hourly and can accumulate fast especially around holiday weekends. "
good,"Gives opportunity to work independently and prove myself."
good,"Ensuring that dual control is maintained while associate open mail, responding to email, returning escalated calls. "

good,Very Routine make outbound and receive incoming calls. handle each account by clearing delinquency
good,Nice company to work for in terms of benefits and employees. The work is not so much demanding as it is repetitive. The work environment is very friendly. Fellow employees are great. Upper management can be a bit bias at times.

good,"Finance is a priority at Ally and they seem to attract high quality candidates to these positions. A lot is expected of you, and you have the opportunity to learn about many aspects of the business. Value is also placed on breadth of experience and there is active effort by management to rotate people into new groups or responsibilities every 18-24 months. Most jobs are very fast paced.F"
good,Overall ok company to work for. I have learned alot about the industry. The company is inclusive and encouraging  when it comes to culture.  Not many positions of upward growth within the company.
good,Great organization with strong culture. Market leader with strong reputation. Collaborative work environment with many talented individuals all working together to increase brand awareness.
good,"I knew what was expected daily at work, culture was great, given the opportunity to help with interviews, organize events., assist different departments, training new hires."
good,They truly embrace the teamwork concept and to me that strengthens any company.  I learned a lot of technical skills (data mining/deck building) that I didn't have prior to arriving.  The hardest part of the job for me was the travel.
good,"Working with customers is ever changing, rarely a dull moment. Ally is invested in giving back to the community. Paid time off for volunteering. Flexible to meet family needs within reason, it is still a business."
good,"If call center life is for you then you will love this job. Very gossipy, put that is to be expected given the environment. Cafeteria on site is a plus. GM discount."
good,"I've never worked somewhere that truly offers the kind of culture that Ally offers. Its competitive but supportive, great company events, even better benefits. Unfortunately, they have incredibly strict background checks on new and current employees."
good,"This is a good company to work for, if you can work well in a stressful situation. You will have a good family oriented working situation. If you don't mind working hard with your bosses micro managing you then this is a perfect place to work."
good,Great place BUT they really need to work on how they can grow from with in. With that in mind and more room for advancement people will look to a better place to work // on the other hand they do have fun and do a few events to invite there coworkers to have fun times .
good,Ally is a great place to work. The managers understand work life balance and making sure you learn the skills needed to advance.  I can't say enough good things about working at Ally. I transitioned roles within Ally during my time and the process was simple and easy. Decent pay and outstanding benefits.

good,"Family oriented, and professional place to work and very understanding and open door policy. They will help you develop a specific carer path and ways to obtain that career and guide you"

good,customer service at fast pace option to help someone get back on track and feel good about it.  option to bonus and make extra cash. option to move up in the company and option to get reimburse for education

good,"Company has a lot of PTO ( 20 days ) "

good,"Atleast to work with my team, it was fun and environment was relaxed and collaborative."
good,"As a re-marketing specialist I learned how to be self motivated, communicate effectively and professionally, and adapt to different processes and managers."
good,A typical work day consists of creating and analyzing procedural and regulatory documentation for day-to-day business practices. I acquired many skills that helped in identifying and mitigating risks as they came into my line of business. The hardest part of the job is prioritizing your workload into managable segments.
good,"overall this is a great company to work for....Ive learned collection skills, management is good when you get a chance to know your manager and a understanding is developed"
good,Great Contract work.  Worked for the BASEL II team and admired the management.  We had some issues in funding for the project causing delays but overall it was a professional position
good,"I got a lot from ally and was my first project as an junior level tester and got a kind of training for two weeks. All staffs, like devs, product owner, scrum master ... have gave me a good memory for the duration that I stayed there"
good,"call center work place. desk area was very comfortable for working 10 hr shifts. "
good,"Large national projects working with teams all over the country. "
good,"I was looking forward to working for this company.  The location is the only issue.  It's in an area that makes it hard to get to in bad weather and there was a few issues with the building when I was there.  Overall the people there are amazing and very motivated to make their numbers which was awesome.  I spent too much time geting to and from the location to make it worth while for me.   Super place if you have a vehicle.  Only part that was not ok was after I gave my notice, my temp contract was terminated  so I couldn't complete my 2 weeks.  That is the only downside to being a temp to hire."
good,"Management styles vary by team. "
good,Ally is an exciting company and will be interesting to watch them over the next decade to see how they grow in a tight economy with other companies moving in to the market and Ally moving into other new markets.
good,"Good company to work for, they have excellent products and give very good customer service to dealers and the end user. They do provide training for all employees. My superiors where very good to work for and did not micro manage their subordinates."

good,"The hardest part of the job is where to find information, but overall, everyone is willing to help and you don't usually feel like you're alone. I learned many things about banking and at the beginning, you go through a training class and that was pretty stressful because the expectations are so high, but when you actually get on the floor to take calls, you'll feel more loose and like you can be more of yourself and also follow the procedures that you need to do. All in all, it is difficult once you start, but with some more experience and with some confidence, you'll do just fine."
good,They really focus on work-life balance work with you to get any issue resolved the management is sometimes Young but understanding. They're always up for new and fresh ideas.

good,"Culture is made up of the values, beliefs, underlying assumptions, attitudes, and behaviors shared by a group of people. Culture is the behavior that results when a group arrives at a set of—generally unspoken and unwritten—rules for working together.  Ally was superior in these areas at every turn."
good,The only complaint was that you could not make bonus due to the expectations being so unrealistic. Other than that it was a good place to work. My supervisor is a very smart and competent individual.
good,Provided great platform to learn about the automotive commercial lending business.  Developed clear and precise written and verbal communication skills along with strong analytical abilities.
good,none  -there have been a number of changes in the organization and several of them the results of the direction and oversight of our current CEO.  What can I say?

good,Ally is a great place to work. There is constant change and constant opportunity to learn.  There is a lot of movement and opportunity to learn different stages of collections delinquency.
good,Contract ended or I would have continued to work there.  Management is very solid and co-workers are collaborative.  The physical environment and parking arrangements make working in downtown Detroit very special.
good,Ally is driven on people working out tough problems.  It is fast paced and a good long-term job.  You have to stay involved or you will get left behind.
good,"Competitive place to work.  Team work.  Work balance is not achieve due to not able to have a fixed off day which allows more flexible to schedule ahead dr. appointments, school functions, etc."
good,"Ally Financial has a good workplace culture with good people, but the technology infrastructure is behind other companies.  The Detroit, MI office is brand new with a workforce that tends to be new as well."
good,"I have exponentially grown with Ally aka GMAC since I originally hired in 1990.  There are lots of advancement opportunities for those that thrive in a faced-paced, exciting and competitive environment."
good,Ally is a great place to work. There are plenty of different things to do so you're always learning. The training isn't too long and very informative.
good,"People are already set in their roles at Ally and no one is leaving which makes it hard for advancement.  Also the cost of living is expensive here, so I need more money."

Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist.

The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,good company to work for management willing to assist and help on any questions that may come up as well as assisting on tools used for the job as well.
good,"great career company. most employees have 10+ years there. Ally is all about Doing It Right and I love that! I have years of experience at multiple companies, most being fortune 200 and Ally is by far one of the top 3 best."
good,Great evironment. My coworkers make it extremely enjoyable to come to work everyday. The bonus structure and benefits are the best I've come across with a company so far.
good,I think that it's a very easy job and anyone can make this job a home. Not really many options in regards to advancing in the company.

good,"a typical day at Ally involved a lot of focusing on getting a good job done to collect on delinquent accounts."
good,"Good environment to work.  Started day with daily meeting and  status of department in reaching their goals.  Talked about new products and procedures which company had implemented.  Hardest part of job is locating people that did not want to be found. My  accounts were late stage delinquency and customers were desperate to hide their vehicles as unable to bring account current or pay anything at all in many cases."
good,"The organization is a great place to work for. The hardest part of the job is unachievable expectations,  which can be discouraging at times. The organization has a team perspective which encourages group participation, teamwork and motivation to achieve a goal. As far as opportunities for growth, I do not anticipate it happening for me, therefore, it is necessary to seek employment elsewhere."
good,I enjoyed the job but I was disappointed in the fact that I felt they only would promote certain people and I went back to college and achieved my master's degree and still was turned down several times for positions I interviewed for. I wanted growth I spent six years at ally financial services. I have also been with bb&t financial services one year in auto collections for seven years total.
good,"I enjoyed my job."
good,"Employee friendly environment, good benefits along with a 401k plan"
good,"I enjoy my job at Ally.  In my role as an Account Services Rep, I have met and worked with many good people--management and co-workers.  I have learned an enhanced focus on the customer with a desire to fulfill their needs.  Actually, the hardest part of the job is delivering the news that the customer's application has been declined by my company.  However, that is part of the business and I have learned to deliver that news with care and empathy.  My typical day at work starts and ends with a total focus on the customer, which is what I like the best."
good,"I learned that change is not only good, it is a great opportunity to learn new things, meet new people and apply what you have to offer to the greater good of the company."

good,My experience with Ally was positive. Managers cared about their staff. Co-workers were qualified and motivated. I was disappointed when the break-up of Ally and Rescap occurred. Hopefully the transition will work out well for both parts of the company.
good,"Each day was pretty busy.I spoke to different people from all over the U.S and was able to help them with their savings goals. I learned how to go above and beyond, to be obviously better, and to focus on building the ultimate customer experience. My coworkers were very nice and helpful. We all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was that we would often have system issues which made it hard to assist the customers at time. I enjoyed being acquainted with different people from all walks of life and learning so much."
good,Great place to do excellent work. Good folks focused on business and customer goals.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,While at work I make outbound calls to customers as well as receive calls from customers. In my department I have to do thorough skip tracing to make contact with customers. This requires me to use multiple skip tracing programs.  I'm required to call insurance companies as well as any outsource vendors to retrieve and provide updates.

good,Ally Bank is a popular online bank. They are among people seeking strong rates and robust customer service. This is pro as well as a little inconvenient to some people as they do not have physical branches. Overall satisfied working there
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Ally. They offer a great environment for work, support and promotions. The time I spent there was very educational and working remotely was one of the best benefits."
good,Great people to work with. Not the most updated systems to work on and raises are small. Local office is small with minimal chance to advance. Nothing else to say. You have Retail and commercial.
good,"Ally really does value the work life balance of their employees which is great. However, the salary and health insurance should be reviewed to be able to compete with other like organizations. At times, it also feels like there is little training in place to move an employee from an individual contributor to a manager level role."

good,"great company, seems mortgage is not stable. Company seems to care about the employees great work life balance. I would recommend this company else where but mortgage is unstable."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my summer internship at Ally Financial Inc. because I felt welcomed from day 1. The internship program, especially within Strategic Alliances where I worked, was excellent and gave me the professional exposure I was looking for. Long-term, I can see that progressing might be a challenge but as a summer internship, I would recommend the experience."
good,This company was very fun and enjoyable to work. I truly enjoyed going to work everyday. The environment was laid back but things we accomplished on a day to day basis with little to no resistance
good,"Great place to work, great environment. Employees are always helpful and kind. Management is great as well and with great benefits. One of the best placeselection I've worked."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy managing people. I was known as a manager who would take a team of misfits and turn them into a family, who enjoy coming to work. As with any job or position, there were difficult days; however, in the end, this was a great company."
good,"A typical day at work will be calling account that are past due and try to get the customer on the phone to bring account back up to good standards. "
good,"Good team atmosphere. The pay was fair, but could be tweaked from an incentive standpoint. Management was fair and worked hard to make sure you had the proper tools to do your job."
good,"This was my grand attempt to get back into sales. I was a one horse company and struggled from the get-go to acquire clients. I had sales but not enough to feed the bulldog, as it were. I capitulated."

good,"The banking industry is quite tough. But at Ally, their main concern is the customer. They're highly geared towards customer service which sets them above regular banks. But when it comes to their employees? that's a whole different ballgame."
good,Good work environment. Hard. Long hours. Creative. Not good work-life balance. Bad management. Poor expectations from management. Challenging work. Character building.
good,Ally is a great place to work. I love working there however it is difficult to move up in such a small company. If they close a departu they usually put people somewhere else to work within the company
good,"The training is great, they have people their to help you if you need it or get stuck trying to figure something out. they also pay for school so you could go to school while working there."

good,"My typical day work is to check my emails from my manager for any new guidelines."
good,I loved ally financial. They care about their employees. Great benefits and always have activites going to keep the business morale and motivation up.
good,"Ally is team oriented. Like a clock, if one piece is down the others will not be able to finish. They all work together to keep the ball rolling. Working there you learn many aspects of the Car Dealership industry."
good,"Good company, not a lot of room for growth. The reason I am submitting my application is to find a company with room for growth."
good,"i like culture there and , management was too good. Environment where we work was learning and target achieving .all work there with good zeal and enthusiasm."
good,This is a good place to work in fulfillment. They just started being a call center about a year ago and they have not got the call center aspect together.

good,Working for Ally Financial was a wonderful challenge. I was encouraged to take charge regarding decision making. It gave me the experience and confidence to move forward toward bettering the company and myself
good,Ally is a great company that turned itself around. I am highly recommending Ally for prospective employees.
good,Ally is great place to work with equal life/work balance. The company has a workforce that is expanding but also has long tenure.
good,"Took inbound and outbound calls to help assist homeowners find a solution to keep or sell their home with the ultimate outcome of not having a foreclosure. Being part of a team was great. I did excel and would bonus monthly but this hard work, overtime, and dedication helped my team members as well, The hardest part was when after carefully reviewing every option available to the homeowner to tell them that they were denied for a loan modification or selling was their only optiion. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a homeowner had almost given up hope and I was able to help them find a way to keep their property."
good,• Contacted customers to determine their reasons for continued delinquency.
good,"I really injoyed working at Ally as far as helping customers keep thier car in difficult time of hardship. The only problem At this company is the people with managment  Authority . When you apply and are givin employment through Ally you have to work that postion for a year before moving around inside the company , which ok Yes is more than fair . I was fortunate to have gotten a contract through a local temp place . And was at Ally for 9 months or so stayed busy It was great I was lucky to have worked in their Loss Mitigation team for 4 months before moving over to assist another dept Extensions thats work was great also , my down fall was thinking my excellent work , good attendance , postive  attitude would get me a  permanent  placement at Ally . However I was wrong . Apparently if you reject managment /Team leads down for personal outtings  you get blacklisted by the whole company . This company needs new managment in alot of places that is based solely on the work and work goals for saving Ally money in sales /Chargeoffs and other areas money is involved."
good,The most thing that I loved about Ally is it is not micro managed.They are very understandable. If you have family issues they understand and are willing to let you leave if you have to.
good,"A typical day at work, would be for the team to have their list organized to their likings, therefore when calls start to come in at 8am. to have a productive day."
good,"Laid back environment."
good,Ally is a great place to work.  The management and leaders of this company are approachable. The culture here is widespread as you can see as soon as you walk through the doors. Deposit Operations at this site has a little over 200 employees. The hardest part of the job are the frequent organizational changes.
good,"I recomment ALLY Finanacial's no bank hosted environment which a lot different having had to work with their Engineers and working with AWS asa their Platform for SaaS environment."
good,"Mostly call center positions, some opportunities for advancement, great staff culture, onsite cafe, quality controlled, easy to talk to all levels of management"
good,"Ally is a great co, with great people. There is some favoritism, but if you work hard and have a pleasant personality and drive & enthusiasm, they will work with you and help you push for success. The atmosphere has changed a lot, and what was once a close knit team working unit has become claustrophobic and super stressful. Everything is under watch...they even tell you when you can take a break or not. "
good,The list you are given sometimes work in your favor and often times they don't. You can come to work everyday follow all calling protocol and still be at risk. Ally rankings are based on a random list of delinquent accounts each month.
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,"Good company that takes care of its employees "
good,"Great company to work for, lots of Micro Management, hires from within. I would work for this company again if given the opportunity. You do start from the bottom answering phone calls and trying to meet unrealistic performance numbers then you can make your way up."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Typical day at work: be in and ready to work at 8, heavy inbound/outbound calls to dealerships and GMAC customers. my lunch hour from 3:45 4:45 to get my kids from school, then leave at 5 pm. This occupation has taught me so much in the 8 1/2 years I was there such as: steady research til problem is solved, short deadlines to meet, and prompt adjustments to be made when neccessary, and the importance of accuracy and detail. The hardest part of my job was leaving at 5 pm, I couldn't wait to start the next day, at times I would go home thinkning of new ideas/plans to make our job a little easier.My most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers and dealerships and working deligently to solve any problem they were experiencing in a timely matter. At times, there would be letters of appreciation and/or verbal over the phone ""thank you's"" to my supervisor for appreciation of me assisting them."
good,Great company the people and environment is a great place overall. Only thing went wrong the bonus pay out change and the turnover rate increase. New hires were making more the people that had been with the company for years. So they no longer value their employees.
good,"I really enjoy working at Ally Bank however, the upward mobility within the Operations Department is limited.The company is continuing to grow and is a fast paced environment which I enjoy working in."
good,Depending on the position most days are typical and the grind is pretty much the same all the time. Get more done or get more sales. Benefits are the best in the business.
good,I would say Ally is fair you wont make a ton of money here but it is a good place to gain experience for the next step in a career. If you can with stand the pay gap Ally would be a great place to work.
good,"Would definitely go back., the AML/Compliance department was an enjoyable, comfortable environment. Management was easy to talk to and work with. They did a great job training and preparing employees for the position."
good,"I loved everything about working at Ally, we had awesome bonuses every month, I looked forward to them."
good,"Very large, very professional company.  Senior leadership plays an active role in the company.  Management is genuinely interested in career development and individual growth."
good,I learn to improve my personnel mangment and training skills.
good,Ally was a great place to work. The work culture was awesome. The pay was ok. Not many growth opportunities. Classes were required and available to help you learn more skills
good,Good company with strong history in the industry. Supportive to other career interest if you are within business centers. Could use more remote opportunities
good,Relevante offers a very flexible schedule for those wanting to work from home. The management staff is very approachable and always there when you need them.
good,Overall the company has a strong customer focus and is a good place to work with good compensation.  Dont approve of any remote work (require onsite presence).  Good company
good,I would recommend Ally to people. It has prepared me for a workforce I wasn’t prepared for before working here. It has improved my skills in communication and banking.
good,"Ally was a great company to work for. In my tenure with the company I was able to gain knowledge of almost every department, the company believed in educated their employees."
good,"We have a close nit team environment encouraging all involvement. Everyone brings something different to the table. We utilize each others talents not for a selfish gain but for team success. I learned by working with such a diverse environment with a broad difference of knowledge, how to approach people and provide what I call wifftau ""whats in it for them and us."" to accomplish a goal. I also learned the importance of listening more than taking with both co-workers and customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to help a customer who thought there was no help when they need it the most, and from then on I am their point of contact for anything else. This is why I make it priority to learn my job, if I don't have an answer I find it. When I cannot help a customer because they have exhausted all options and I have to be honest and advise the next steps if we cant come to a mutual surrender of the asset."
good,"The bank is a nice place to work, sometimes it depends on position that you are in.    They are not busy as a bigger bank is.   They have repetitive processes which makes it difficult to move forward.  Not really interested in making actual process changes.   Lack of career growth."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,A day at work would be busy making contact with Customers to make payments..Management was good...Hardest part of the job was getting people to pay there bills...Bonus checks were very nice...
good,"i enjoy working here, good people i would recommend this to others. managers are approach able, and willing to assist. its been along time sense i actually like the way managers motivate there employees"
good,"In my 30 years with the company, I've learned a lot. I started out filing bankruptcy proofs of claim, and have moved through most every department until I've landed in commercial acquisitions. I've learned to work as a team player with great people."
good,"Productive, fun and learning experience from colleagues and organization."
good,Great place but always issues with the long term security of the company due to TARP funding
good,"Debit Card and Bill Pay management for Deposit Operations including ticket management, defect management, release validation, vendor management, creation of business requirements, education, policy and procedure creation and implementation."
good,"Ally offers a significant amount of opportunities for staff who have the talent and initiative to grow their skills. Ally champions innovative thinking, challenging the status quo, agility and results orientation. A great place to work those who want to make their mark."
good,"It really is a great company to work for. Schedule, pay, benefits, co-workers, culture are great. Do your job and you'll be more than ok. Management could be better. After the 1st year you can move within the company. Good bonuses in the collections department."
good,"From the ground up - college to Executive great education. Great Company, Benefits, Raises comes slow but is always there. Most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,"This bank is great to work at after you hop over the learning curve. They ask you to be flexible and have open availability yet they don’t seem to be flexible with the options they give you, thats my only gripe. Good people and good knowledge you may actually use and share with others willing to listen. They really do promote hiring within they out sourced two people the two years I worked there and those were higher up positions."
good,My overall experience working for this company was great. I wish I could have been with them longer. Unfortunately it was a temporary term. My Supervision fought for me to stay on longer but they did not have any full-time positions available. I was hired through a temp agency who also tried to extend my term but was unsuccessful. Ally Bank is a great online bank which specifically deals with official checks. Your processing customers request in a timely manner. It was different from working in local banks because you were only dealing with official checks and balancing.
good,"i worked there when it was still called Nuvell and GMAC financing and left not too long after it turned to Ally, i worked there 8 years in collections. collections can be stressful. i liked the people i worked with and there was always bonuses and perks but it can get to you working in a stressful environment day in and day out."
good,"All around good company . Looks out for everyone with team environment, perfect work / life balance. Room for growth and advancement in all departments"
good,"Great people and great place to work."
good,"Day to day, the other associates were helpful. I enjoyed working for the company as a whole and the culture of the company was met with a few exemptions. I had no issues with the overall culture of the company."
good,A great place to learn and cross train in other departments.  Management has an open door policy and you can build several working relationships.  Good benefits.
good,Ally Bank and Ally Financial Inc are amazing companies to work for with exceptional benefits and adequate pay for their positions across each line of business and function.
good,working as a 90 rep i handle accounts 90-120 trying to collect or charge off the account.
good,"Great company to work for and to be apart of, I loved my time there and sad that it was short lived due to life changes with moving. Would 100% work there again!"
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist. The workplace culture is incredible, very diverse and accepting of all backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be trying to have customers commit to making timely payments, the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that its fast paced and learning new ways to help the business prevent losses."
good,i work for a lot of banks in the past but this place has ERG a great work area and help you with your job and your personal life. i think ally cares about there employees they go by the rule if you take care of your employees they will take care of your customers
good,"Working for ALLY Financial was a great experience for me. I worked for their PM where he put me in the driver seat with cutting edge technologies such as AWS, Google G-Suite, Cloud Applications, Windows 7, MySQL, and Docker."
good,"Great upper management very involved in making everyone feel welcome.  Unfortunately Ally has a small presence in Minnesota meaning there are limited opportunities for change.  Also, attracting qualified talent with not great name recognition was challenging in this market."
good,"Good family oriented work environment.  Not too much room for growth, but they do know how to recognize hard working people. They tend to promote within so if you work hard it will definitely pay off."
good,"Ally is a financial firm with a strong emphasis on internal culture, change, and constant growth. They provided me with solid corporate experience and a friendly atmosphere during my internship."
good,Lots of room and opportunity to grow. Constantly challenges your time and multi-tasking skills. Great company to work for. No two work days are the same.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Great work-life balance, great management, and thorough training. With that being said, being located right outside of Chicago, I felt the starting salary wasn't quite enough to live comfortably in the area. However, I'd say the pay is still competitive for the industry and the benefits are great."
good,"Over my time with Ally, I have had the opportunity to take on 6 different roles and move from an entry-level position to a leadership role, seeing several different parts of the company.  The work environment is collaborative, and one where our employees are empowered to drive real change and business results in the organization.  The company has somewhat of a start-up mentality/feel while offering the benefits and security of a larger organization.  I would highly recommend Ally as an employer."
good,Ally always recognize their top performing employees weekly and monthly. They award these employees monthly with  bonuses and  gift cards drawings. Ally provides a annual picnic for all employees. Ally have good benefits for their employees which includes health and life insurance. Ally offered a 401k plan.    The workplace environment is full of employees working together to get the jobs done.  The hardest part of the job is when you work hard and you collect on accounts and met your quota and  come in the next day and find out you have some insufficient checks.
good,"Strong process and good collaboration.  Work environment was productive, tools were up to date and teams were staffed to meet timelines.  Good culture."
good,"Ally is an amazing company with great benefits, employees, and management. The workplace culture is unbeatable. "
good,"This company is a great place to work, great people, and managers. When I first started, I never had any collection experience however if you have customer service you will do fine. Bonus are great managers are willing to help you succeed as long you put in the effort. Within a 2 years, I have moved to different department because I become a (SME) they will promote within  if you bonus and go above your KPI's. I moved up in Vendor management oversea our collection agency. If you just work and complain about work please don't apply. If you put in the effort, very competitive, willing to coach and learn you will do great. Great open door policy."
good,Wonderful company to work for.  The people are fantastic!  Benefits are great!  It's a very charming workplace.  You work hard and you have a very supportive all around team environment.
good,This job was amazing if it were any way to advance or grow I may have stayed. I was a regular collections agent and i was offered a supervisor job at another company and took it. I still miss Ally
good,"I loved working for Ally. The managers I had were great and they always made working there fun. We did plenty of department functions and they were exciting. As a new employee, they gave me ongoing support after training."
good,"Calling outbound and taking inbound calls."
good,I have a lot of experience in the account as it is my first project. i enjoyed everyday here with my colleagues who are really Fun to work with . we have a great work - social life balance
good,"dealing with different customers everyday "
good,Great company to work for and to retire from. For some the location is great however most of the company is over 30 miles it would be great if it was around public transportation.
good,"Great place to work, the people are friendly and they have many activities that allow for employees to interact."
good,"The job consists of talking to customers that are past due on their auto loans. Ive learned how to interact with the customer and create a way to have a win win situation for both customer and company. Management makes sure you have all the tools needed to assist.

good,"I love everything about my job at ally it can be stressful but it’s nothing serious if you push yourself too hard you may not need to push as hard if it gets that way we’ll that's for me. Each is different but the job is great pay, some good people, it’s hard to say anything bad about Ally."
good,I enjoyed working with the team. The manager was fair and neutral. We frequently had catered lunches which were favorable restaurants. My job faded out and manager attempted to have me as permanent but the department had Loan officers completing our roles during calls. Flexible hours and all the overtime I could work. Nothing negative about job.jolaslonger. temporary turned to permanent
good,Ally takes exemplary efforts to ensure that its culture and employee engagement remain strong for a meaningful work experience and strong performance.
good,Worked on a 5 year project and each day was busy and moved fast. Management was great to work with. Pay and vacation was great. Flexible work schedule.
good,This was a great place to work. Many goal incentives were provided. Several employee appreciation days were celebrated throughout the year. Enjoyable work environment.
