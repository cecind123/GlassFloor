rating,review
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,They turn their back on employees. Never have a fair opportunity. They show favoritism to certain people and some but not all of management is a joke.
bad,"The only way to move up in this store is to be Hispanic, as the hiring staff. They do not look at your experience, job reviews, length of service, attitude, or abilities."
bad,while I was training at Best buy they didn't get me prepared for Black Friday they didn't give me hours to work not even part-time hours it's a horrible place to work.
bad,"Terrible management, work conditions, support and everything else one would normally expect to have while working did not exist in here. I hope to never see them again."
bad,Best Buy didn’t have any clear path for growth for most of the ambitious employees that they have. The companies values didn’t match with my own as a person so that is something I look for in an employer to have the same value was I.
bad,Biased work place as one could imagine but multiply it x10. Near no advancement opportunities if they like you where you are. Save yourself the time .
bad,No advancement opportunities for someone with years of experience.  The management is awful and they make you feel like a criminal by checking your bags when you come in and when you leave.
bad,"Working for Best Buy is terrible, especially at Geek Squad City. Don't work there. It's like a cult. They pry into your personal life and rate you based on how friendly you'll be with the leadership and their lackeys. It's by far the most toxic work environment I've ever been in."
bad,Needs to be forthcoming of expectations and job descriptions when asking if willing to help out in other job titles. Felt untrained and left to fail without warning. I also felt I was forgotten and not important.
bad,The people you work with are great people but you get the usual big box store attitude from management you would from any other. Job is simple fellow employees are great.
bad,"Manager in North Haven store talked about everyone behind their backs and refused to accept responsibility. Also went against HR policy numerous times and made working there unpleasant. I also wasn't given my yearly review and she hired high school kids and paid them more than me when I had over 5 years of experience at the time. If you aren't a suck up, she makes your life miserable."
bad,management and HR don't listen to anything you have to say.  beside that my co workers were the only reason i wanted to go to work and the pay is horrible for what they expect of you.
bad,Not at all helpful or supportive management takes advantage of its staff doesn’t follow availablity and plots against  you to ultimately get you terminated not a very friendly place to work and gm is completely and absolutely the ring leader of it all
bad,"I have a lot to say and it’s hard to find anything positive. I worked at this location for almost 5 years. At first I enjoyed it but don’t we all with a new job. Eventually I caught onto what was really happening. Management always seemed secretive and sketchy. They never communicated with the employees. It was hard to do your job when they wanted you to do it a certain way and then changed rules every week. Then when you weren’t doing the job the way they changed it to, you’d get a write-up. There was favoritism to the extreme going on in terms of, well, everything. Allowing full-time position employees to take 15 minute or more breaks every hour. Letting certain people do what they wanted, whenever. Choosing who they wanted personally for promotions instead of going based on performance. Allowing certain employees to get away with things and not others. Holding the wrong people accountable. I could go on. The worst part is that they don’t even sit down and talk with you about what you can improve on. They talk about it to other managers and it makes you, as an employee, look bad. If they find out you even contact HR about anything going on, you get treated differently. Which of course is against company policy, but who can help you if HR works with management as well? If you don’t do as they say the way they want, they’ll personally find something they can fire you over, no matter how insignificant. It happened to other employees and it happened to me. Don’t even get me started on using vacation time. You get the worst attitude out of the managers when you want to request"
bad,They wanted me to sign stuff illegally like power if attorneys and I would not do it so they quit approving my deals I submitted horrible place to work
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend working here if you want decent pay and a non toxic employee environment, managers there were terrible and I will never think about going back"
bad,"The wages are the lowest on the entire retail jobs. They push you to sell services and if you don't make the quota,they cut your hours. Management are a joke. They lack of communication and leadership."
bad,I stopped working for them after they only gave me three shifts in three months once the holiday season ended. They said they would always have work for me and i had to make calls to even get those three shifts.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,The Geek Squad client services are full of micro managers and the pay is low and there is no room for growth. The hours are terrible its a modern slave ship. It feel like jail or elementary school. The turn over rate is high cuz its a terrible place to work. A lot of Chiefs not enough Indians .
bad,Fired me too slow thought this company was best on the list to work for. No help with the job I was doing. Treated not far. A mile to walk to the job.
bad,"Don't apply. Waste of time. HR is a joke, and nobody has a clue what they're doing. Skip and apply for a real company. Nothing else to say, other than I.cannot stress what a waste of time applying at this company would be."
bad,"This store is only as good as the management it is under pick the right store good luck , depending on the time of year based of my location it dragged. work environment is fine usually everybody is chill until its that person that gets on your nerves."
bad,"Bad management, poor hours,poor  benefits and no support from corporate leadership. The  geek squad was the biggest joke of all. They had no training at all and over charged for all service."
bad,Alot of the store had their special employees and you couldn't move up unless you was special employee. Worked there for two years an had family work there as well and its still the same nothing will change.
bad,Worked over time and full time hours for months to be chosen over friends and family favoritism and lack of accountability is rampant. managers including the GM would rather sleep in the back room than tell their friends to do their jobs.
bad,"The way things we're run was awful. I wouldn't blame in-store managers, it's from the higher-ups that need to figure out how to run a dying business. thats all"
bad,"The management is a joke. They could careless how much time you invest or what you do for the company as long as it benefits them and you do what your told like a good boy or girl. They want people they can control, not people that think and act on their own. At least in the watertown ny store anyway. And nothing ever gets done about the managers that blow, the managers just target the people that stand up to them till they quit or find a way to fire them."
bad,Great place to gain experience and build resume. Promotions are present all the time. Down sides are leadership is only worried about their own quotas and their attitudes will change quickly when given pressure by higher ups. if you're in sales you will be expected to sell like you're commission based even though you aren't. You will spend a lot of time standing and walking but the floors are literally a thin layer of carpet over cement so expect feet and ankle problems if you stay a long time.
bad,"Worked here in the order filling and decant area. The supervisor for this area is clearly unqualified. The are production target to be met by each worker, but he doesn't understand that different products should be measured differently when calculating production metrics.. A box of usb drives can be processed a lot quicker than a box of tablets. HIs answer is that work flow to each worker over time will compensate for this. But this is not true if certain workers are continually supplied with easy-to- process items to meet their numbers. There are way too many low-skilled leads walking around doing nothing most of the time. Not so many are needed. Many areas of this warehouse are dead and without any activity going on. Best Buy is striving to compete with the big online retailer. Judging from how this place is run, I don't see it in business more than a few more years"
bad,"Typical retail job, with everything that comes along with that. They don't care about employees or even customers. They just want to squeeze as much money out as possible. They will claim that you're part-time, but then you'll work 45 hours a week at just above minimum wage with no benefits."
bad,"At first, this job was great. But I was fired for no cause because the new General Manager did not ""like"" me. I was really inconvenient for my family. ."
bad,They will continuously micromanage you and are discriminatory. Would not recommend you work here. I left after a few month of working here. The environment is terrible.
bad,"DO NOT work at this store if you do like favortism and not in a good way!  current sales sup will degrade you and talk to you like your are a piece of trash, actually he will can you a piece of trash over the radio and in front of customers, and the store manager allows it and wants to promote him!! how professional!! he brags about upsetting his team and making them cry . GREAT MANAGEMENT!!!!   people are only promoted if you are a favorite!!  Its Crazy!!  Store manager actually said ""I dont fire people I just cut their hours and make them miserable until they quit"" . I am one of those miserable employees being pushed out ! AGAIN GREAT MANAGEMENT this is not the store it used to be!!  stay far far away from this store . go to Martinsburg or Winchester Best Buy if you want to be treated like a human being because this store hires and promotes based on favortism.  Not all Managers here are Bad A few are great and actually care and are fair."
bad,"They treat their employees like a number instead of actual people. "
bad,"I’ve been with the company a long time. I thought there would be an opportunity for growth based on my skills and education and, that is not the case here. If you’re in high school or finishing college this is a decent place to work. However, to make a career of this is difficult. It’s been a politics game to try to move up in this company."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"This is a good place to work when you have little experience. You will learn many important skills if you are dedicated, work hard and show up on time."
bad,I don’t really like the company or what they do but the people I worked with were really nice. Management was a mess and leader ship and no direction or organization skills
bad,"The only real way to grow is if someone likes you more than the quality of your work."
bad,"If you're looking to spend a few months making sub par salary and gain minimal experience, it's the place for you. Otherwise look elsewhere."
bad,Best Buy doesn’t care about their employees. Their pay is horrible. They say they will get you hours but then they ignore you and give you 4 hours a week. The management at Best Buy yells at their employees and treats them poorly. Definitely favoritism going on at Best Buy.
bad,"Huge issue with behind closed door arrangements to advance employees based on friendship level with management, schedule tampering, and fake interviews to keep conflict of interest situations hidden.  Huge turn over rate employees often leaving due to depression, stress, anxiety."
bad,"this is a place were someone who knows about technology can go to loose interest in it all together, from bad management to an even worse application portal dont go into this job expectation a real work experience"
bad,I personally did not like working there. They like you based on how much you sell the merchandise and protection plans. Even if you expand the truth to the customers.
bad,"It's retail. Customer facing, slinging products that there is next to no training on for pathetically low pay and terrible hours. I don't recommend retail work to anyone."
bad,"Best Buy is a very selfish company. I had managers basically tell me to accept fraud. ""Anything for the sale"" is the truth behind the company. There are policies that the employees must follow, but as soon as you try to explain that to customers the manager comes out and just does the opposite. Again, anything for the sale. I had customers cause a scene, yell at me, and cuss me out. The managers were ok with this and would usually accommodate these people. I never felt heard or cared about."
bad,Good as a part-time job if you are studying. But no considerable growth in salary over long term. Good as a starting job. Not beneficial continuing long term if you are ready to study for a course.
bad,"No support "
bad,Very unprofessional. Management has no filter and does not know how to talk to employee. They show favoritism and call employees hurtful names. They have a large turnover rate and want do anything about it.
bad,"This place was not fun to work for. Managers did not care for you and took advantage of you. You could be a great worker and they still don't care. Managers made you feel awful almost everyday. Loved some of the people I worked with, but managers made it very hard to work there."
bad,"Be careful who you trust there. It’s way too cliquish. If you don’t sleep around or party, you get blackballed. And if you have a major crisis in your life, don’t give them details thinking that they will be understanding or at the very least be professional. They won’t. They’ll spread your private life situation around like it’s cheap gossip then hang you by it."
bad,"They do not value their employees. They keep the bad employees and get rid of the good, hard-working employees. The will lie, cheat and steal to get what they want. I worked at Best Buy for almost three years and was terminated based on “here say” and no valid evidence to suggest these accusations. They “investigated” and had an answer within less than 24 hours. Upper management is quick to point fingers at the line level employees but doesn’t recognize the problem within themselves."
bad,Started out doing inventory and was never even trained to ship out packages or to recieve packages. I did learn everything myself but was never really happy working here. Full time staff act like they are your boss. Most of the people that worked there didnt even help customers.
bad,Mediocre place to work mediocre management lame don't work for them they are very greety selfish and only care for them selves bad work environment pathetic place
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Horrible management, I went through 4 general managers in my six months there. No room for advancement and they underpay their employees. Not worth the money at all."
bad,"i found the employees never worked, management never was around when you called them, they often told you one thing and then it was the opposite infront of customers to make you look bad, there was favorites ALWAYS those people often got 5 smoke breaks an hour and they got to stand around and talk about video games while the only other 2 people carried the weight, management was very unprofessional and often made things personal, it wasnt a warm environment, i was often pushed to work 12 plus hours for 13-14 days straight, i worked every single holiday and notices many employees never had to work one because they were ""liked"", they fired you if you went home for the holidays because i was mandatory  you had to work black friday, and boxing day no ifs ands or buts."
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for 2+ years, and I was denied multiple career advancement opportunities. If you want to advance you have to be apart of the leadership click. They're all buddies with each other and hang out outside work. If you don't suck up to the leadership team you won't advance. Leadership teaches underhanded sales tactics to get your money."
bad,I wish they would have told me when I went for the interview that we would only work 20 to 25 hours a week if that the first day there we clocked in at 8 a.m. and was leaving at 11:30 a.m. and I asked him is this normal they said I was just a typical Sunday or Monday rolled around we were leaving at 12:30 and they push and push and push to meet production I told I told my trainer I'm not going any faster because I'm not trying to go home early I'm actually trying to work a 40-hour work week
bad,I was hurt on the job. They had no compassion at all for the situation. So much so I didn't have a job to go back to and can never work at a best buy again. Still Hurt till this day.
bad,"Geek Squad was the worst job I ever had, people would come in and yell at you for trying to help them and telling them whats wrong with their computers... biggest waste of my time"
bad,"Been told that I'm a ""key"" component to the success of the blah blah blah! I've been hearing the same thing for years and never given the chance to move up or expand my skillset. I keep being told that i was passed up because of the needs of the company. Great place for kids who are just starting out and don't care about money."
bad,"I had joined best buy geek squad with the hope of being able to help people with their daily problems they had with their computers and other electronic devices, however, Best Buy being a business was not happy with the numbers of my department. Ironic considering my department provides a service more than it does selling a products. Rather than actually addressing what the client wanted, we were told to sell them into a solution. That does not work for every client, some are were okay with their old devices because they were familiar with them, and rather than sell them a new device I showed them how to get the most out of the device they currently owned. The culture of Geek Squad is no longer there and that is why I joined the team in the first place, to help people, not sell them a solution."
bad,Worse company to work for PERIOD! Management is a joke the schedules are for people who live with parents can't live off the hours they give you weekly. And they are just liars and no job security.
bad,They are awesome company but employees are dissatisfied and resentful and management is sexist and that causes alot of mistrust between coworkers and creates a bad atmosphere
bad,Management was lazy and abused the heck out of the system. High turn over rate. They would bully and mock employees they did not like. It got worse over time.
bad,"Best Buy made it clear that their priority is the highest revenue possible. The company does not care about offering the highest quality service. Management would play the numbers game and make decision that had a direct negative impact on the employees and by extension the client experience. Cutting corners, violating policy, and violating contracts are all acceptable to the management if it means getting a leg up on the numbers game. Everything from client data privacy, to apple contract, to ""certified"" open box items. Best Buy is the definition of a soulless company. They had no respect for the life of an employee. Scheduling an opening shift right after a closing shift with no remorse. Enabling clients to abuse the employees. Refusing to implement changes when employees repeatedly recommend things that should be done differently in order to improve quality. The list goes on. Best Buy is all talk and no substance. Do not work there unless you want to be stressed out of you mind every time you wake up."
bad,Was not treated with respect. My qualifications for the job well exceeded their standards. Was expected to make decisions then undermined in front of customer.
bad,"Management uses employees and makes you do their work. Management and corporate are all in cahoots with each other."
bad,All they want is gopher type people I was hired to sell appliances with decades of experience all they seemed to care about is unloading truck cleaning and watching shop lifters no one there has long term appliance knowledge like myself it’s all kids paid only slightly more than minimum wage with no  incentives they only want u to sell warranties not good products no bonuses no spiffs
bad,Bad management bad company. No job security. Change pay structure without notifying employees. Don’t care about employees. Not flexible schedules like they advertise.
bad,"I got so fed up of all the downtalk, belittling and bullying surrounding numbers from management that I finally threw in the towel and quit last week. Essentially the managers would hide out in the back office or the breakroom with their walkie talkies shouting out numbers while playing on their phones. The managers were nowhere to be seen assisting with customers, even at times when the store got crowded and we where shorthanded. The managers would always be hiding somewhere. Calling these morons micromanagers was quite an understatement, they were more like nano managers. With every sale we had to write down every detail of the transaction on these documents called ""Customer Recommendation Worksheets"", this was in an attempt to get every customer to walk out of the store with a so called ""complete technology solution"". In the store manager's eyes, we had to convince and write down on this sheet why the customers have to buy the protection plan, tech support, mobile broadbands, a new router, accessories and credit cards to go along with their $300 laptop. The managers also wanted us to file the completed worksheets every day so they can review and give us feedback. One by one, the store manager called in the sales team into the back office to critique and chew us out on why there were empty spots that weren't filled out on the worksheets. Some employees were threatened and even terminated for so called insubordination for refusal to give every customer a ""complete technology solution"". Treating your employees this way everyday through bullying and fear of termination wasn't"
bad,"the management was horrible lots of headache. they don't appreciate you .that why the turn over is so horrible, the promise u things and never come through"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,It's a retail gig with poor management and questionable potential. Company does not have your best interest in mind. Upper management does not respect your availability.
bad,"Very poor management, no organization,employees always calling off so always felt obligated I had to go when called in in order to secure my job management not friendly and very pushy,employees mean to one another and arguing"
bad,"Wasn’t satisfied with my hours, benefits or how the business was managed over all. Best Buy (1258 ) has a lot of favoritism and unfair ways of dealing with both customer issues and their employees."
bad,Fast pace with no down time to breath.  Other then a 401k there are no benefits for part time workers.  Hours and shifts vary greatly between week to week
bad,"I’ve been working for BestBuy part-time every since August of 2014 and I must tell you this job is only for high school kids and people who likes to (shine the managers shoes) and cheat to move up. Bestbuy is a poor excuse for a company, they are all buddies within the company and it’s honestly not worth it. You won’t grow In the company. You have several employees who would get in bed with the managers just get hours and hardworking employees like myself get chump change. Causing me and my family to go hungry and homeless. You’ll loose all motivation with this company and everything you do will go unnoticed and things you do wrong will follow you your entire career with bestbuy. So please go to another company that’s worth it and actually Cares!!!!!"
bad,Best Buy uses people until they burn them out and toss them in the garbage. Watch out. They don’t listen to their employees and fail to provide reasonable accommodations.
bad,"Not enough training. A lot of different personalities with employees. Some are nice, some are rude and others are... odd. Management is no help with questions. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,One of the worst onboarding experience I have had in the 20+ years of retail/grocery experience. Needed help on computer quizzes alot of long winded videos on content that didn't even apply to my position and no managers were near by to ask everyone talking and playing around. Geek squad was the only serious and hard working folks there (Sherman TX 75090)
bad,"Best Buy is nothing what they say it seems. It certainly is not a bad job however the culture and management standards that have set in over the years have switched the focus from the employees to politics. By this I mean that if you get along and have good connections you are able to do stuff or get away with things you’re not supposed to. Also you experience more promotion and career advancement if you establish those type of connections, regardless of actual performance. It’s kinda sad due to having such a fun workplace. They seem to care about employees at first, but overtime when people get promoted there’s always a lot of drama and controversy around the politics of that. Not a team work environment (with the exception of Black Friday), its more like a everyone looks out for themselves as we all compete to move up the ladder if and when possible."
bad,"This was a very good working environment, great company to work for, and always involved with workers, also have great benefits and rewards and have a great chance to advance"
bad,Most days went fine. There are days were customers would come upset and the managers would not step in or be sarcastic with the workers when questions were asked.
bad,"The -sales- training was excellent, but the computer-related training was not. The management has an interest in holding down wages and preventing their best people from advancing.  A typical day in the Computer Department, as the only person with a detailed knowledge of computers in the department, consisted of other sales associates interrupting me mid-sale with computer related questions, no lunch break, no 15 minute breaks, and being questioned by management about not meeting my sales goals because of the other sales associates constantly interrupting me with basic questions about computers.  I left after 4 years and 11 months after getting progressively more fed up with being given more and more responsibility over the team without a consummate raise in pay."
bad,They say it’s not retaliation but it always is u can’t go to your ga and ask for help with management because they flip it on u everyone always quits And corporate does nothing
bad,"I enjoyed working here at first but after awhile all of the flaws became fully exposed. Management is terrible and absent. The only managers ever available are shift leaders and there’s only about 2 who are helpful and aren’t worthless. If you aren’t the sales floor, they don’t care about your needs or how you’re being treated. The front end never gets free lunches or recognition for performance. We have to beg for someone to cover for a bathroom break or help with a long line because there’s only ever one person working at a time. This store is run by favoritism. If you’re close with a manager you can get away with a lot more than the person next to you who isn’t that well liked. Salary management pushes numbers but offers no real solutions because they’re never present on the actual floor instead they stay in the office and throw off issues to department leaders. This place is a joke. I’m sure other locations are great places to work but don’t go to the Greenwood location unless you want to be just another body instead of a valued employee. Unless you’re on the sales floor, of course."
bad,"All they do is scam good people out of their money."
bad,Working there it was frustrating because management did not take the time to work closely with new associates to train them and give them the incentive that they would not be let go after the holiday season was over. The department manager there at the time seemed to have limited experience on how to manage associates and had no leadership abilities other then to bark out occasional orders that we already knew. The manager who ended up managing the store im surprised is still there because he has in my opinion no business managing the store because of his negative attitude.
bad,"Random Tales is a place where two writers collaborate together on a story. Each writes on alternate days, taking the story in a new direction. Neither of them knows where the story will take them to."
bad,Working for this company dispalyed a lot of childhood mindsets. The women that I worked with were essentially mean girls and the managers definitely had nasty attitudes and were not understanding by any means. Shortly after leaving management was changed due to the manager at the time being fired for missing phones and ipads etc.
bad,i was over qualified for this position i had to undo and in some cases do the back techs work for them because customers would come back to the store yelling and crying.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Horrible management. All they do is try to make you sell things even if its the wrong thing to do. They get extremely upset at you if you don't force a customer to buy an item. They want you to lie to them about the item.
bad,the worst company to work for they lack undrrstanding and compassion for what is needed to be done. all they care about is there sales and numbers nothing more than that
bad,They say they want skilled sales professionals that are knowledgeable about the products but they don’t care about that. They want to see you push that credit card app. Also if you hated all the high school clicks you experience as a kid then this place will only bring you more headaches. They DO NOT care about you. You’re just a number and they will severely underpay you for what you have to offer.
bad,best buy was a fun place to work at but It was alittle harder for me because I am not so much of a sales person so it was alitle challenging for me but overall management was goo
bad,"Their only priority is selling credit cards. They don't teach you how to sell, just to list off product features. Often people really only care about price, so the job is nothing but pushing credit cards."
bad,Cut my hours down to two days a week while also trying to pay rent and fees my family. Was going through a hard time and didn’t care and has no respect for employees.
bad,"The Co-Manager had something against the ""New Hires"" and he would constatly pick anyone out and chew them out if they were doing the job 100% correct."
bad,"I worked as an Advanced Repair Agent for their Geek Squad section. Your hours depend on how many systems they have in for repair. I started out at 20 hours a week, and was whittled down to 8 a week in two 4 hour shifts (of course starting at 6am on Saturday and Sunday)."
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for about 3 weeks and I am not impressed. Management is lacking leadership skills, too much goofing off instead of working, and a lot of favoritism shown at work. Good job for a student in high school or college but not for a single parent. And they need to drug test some of the employees and train them on the merchandise they sell."
bad,"Worst store to work for. Definitely regret transferring from another store. No feedback or support from upper management in times of need, and purely sales driven."
bad,"Best buy is a good company, however they don't always treat people and employees fairly like they should. they will take people that they know over others they don't."
bad,My time at Best Buy was brief.. about 1  year or so.  It was had to advance if you did not know the right people.  If one of the managers did not like you there was no way of advancing.
bad,"best buy is a big box retail store that doesn't sell anything people actually need, so to hit sales goals they have to be very pushy, which created a toxic culture. "
bad,too focused on kissing up than work most of the employees that is.instead of being productive so many employees sucked up to the manager and co managers
bad,"Management was never on the same page, while tasks were very heavy and stressful. Work was never delegated fairly and favoritism was always an issue throughout the work staff."
bad,"If you want to work minimum wage, find another company. The headache and stress is not worth it. Management doesn't keep their word and are free to treat employees however they are feeling that particular morning. The benefits, like the employee discount, are nice, but honestly not worth the day-to-day issues and targets one has to deal with."
bad,"I absolutely hated this job! Like so many before me, I made the mistake of coming here because it was the only thing remotely related to IT in the area. I ended up quitting after 3 years of a roller coaster ride with hours and positions and went back to my old job at a supermarket and have been doing much better ever since. I am now an assistant meat manager."
bad,"do not plan to return, long work hours, no structure, not enough training to do the job. management not very friendly. no medical coverage. no set hours."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Don’t work there if you want to have a life, Not a great place to work and you can get anything they sell online for a cheaper price and free shipping."
bad,"They may pay a livable wage but the barely give hours."
bad,"Management act like children.  They tend to pass the buck along to whoever is below them in any way possible unless it is praise (I've seen multiple great employees lose their job because of something their manager told them to do and the manager claims no responsibility and takes none of the consequences).  I've also seen management promote lovers, deny the relationship and then have children together a few months (much less than the 40week gestation period) later.  And these types of behaviors go up to a district level, at least.  "
bad,Mostly I think it had to do with the fact that I'm a lesbian and my supervisor was a bible thumping homophobe. He was literally the worst manager I have ever had and he was shortly fired after I quit.
bad,Management is only  interested in their own advancement.  People that are clearly more capable than others are not promoted over management favorites.
bad,"this company is hugely suffering from lack of management which turned the system to be a step stone for the ones who are new into the job market. the company has various and uncountable quantity of talents within, which striving to move to a new place where their inner potential and outcome is being respected and counted toward the steps of their growth ."
bad,Worst place I've ever worked. Demanding with low pay. Multiple managers that are clueless but have been given the power due to people they know. The work is put on you like you were getting a commission but you're not. They pay either minimum wage or as close to it as possible no matter the experience. Managers put their mistakes on others. And don't even think about going into management because once you reach their max dollar you'll get let go to bring a new person in to start from the bottom.
bad,Management had favorites new employees got paid way more. everyone always got left the job after a few days and I ways like a personal trainer always training new employees for them to leave because they saw how bad it was. it was truly upsetting to see that.
bad,"La experiencia es pésima hoy en dia corren a la gente sin mas ni mas la falta de vivencia de la cultura ahora tratan a los empleados como todo menos como personas y honestamente dejan mucho que desear los gerentes de tienda solo van ""checan"" entrada y se desaparecen todo el dia, el acoso laboral pan diario cada semana"
bad,"everybody complained everyday how much they hated their jobs, made me think they were literally going insane on the clock. everybody hates the boss .watched them love other employees and then do me the exact same way.cool people to work with in the field but you can tell the job makes their lives great again  , found someone to replace me but told me i was getting hired, after i applied i got a email 2 days later being denied. they tell you to lift up to 150 but the truck is always filled with 500-600 lb appliances. this job will disable you so if you get in, make it your last job, just  know you wont be capable of anything else after 5 or 6 years if your lucky."
bad,I worked like a dog and was not appreciated. No balance. I was very unhappy and couldn't get out of there sooner. Entry level employees are paid terribly.
bad,Not a positive place to work and I would not recommend it to anyone. I was happy to not be employed there.  it is not a place to stay long term because the culture was not conducive to long term employment
bad,"When I go to Beat Buy, they were still selling CD’s. I was on every Reset for new   Fixtures, Tv’s etc. Not only my social media helped, my hands too!"
bad,"sucks , poor pay terrible atmosphere, very poor training, lack of incentives to improve. No incentive to advance. Need to include commission. No job security which includes laying off workers without notice"
bad,"They do not care about their employee's. Management looks out for each other and that's about it. Started as a seasonal hire and worked my way up to supervisor over 5 years. "
bad,I tested high on their entrance exams and training. I was given more responsibility but no increase in wage. I was constantly encouraged and pressured to sell a product that was not what the customer was looking for. It felt dishonest and shady. I couldn’t keep a positive outlook on the position despite being an easy going knowledgeable employee.
bad,i am leaving best buy do to poor management and lack of training. working there i was consistently harassed by customers and never was there something done about it
bad,I’ve heard some stores are better than others but stay the heck away from Nashua. God awful management with pay that’s not even competitive with other Best Buy stores in the area let alone other retail positions. If you can stomach one day a week to keep the discount then go for it otherwise stay away.
bad,"Good starting job from an IT perspective"
bad,"you can work as hard as you like you get a pat on the back or high five. a couple cents per raise, expect associates to do manager roles and sell in every department"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I was sexually harassed by many coworkers which did not make me want to show up for work. Management was poor and they did not care about you or anything personal.
bad,"A typical day at work is one of two things: incredibly unproductive, or way too overwhelming. Managers do not communicate with employees, many coworkers are irresponsible, customers are consistently rude. The store is so unorganized and leaves you searching the entire store for a single product that has been misplaced. You only get a lunch if you work a 7 hour shift, otherwise you get nothing. The hardest part is the holiday season. The only enjoyable part are the coworkers because they are all very kind and funny people."
bad,"Typical retail, most of store is part time with no benefits.  I was told I was hired for a permanent job, however after the Christmas Season most employees were cut to 4 hours a week to run us off and not let us go."
bad,I worked there for 12 years and they laid me off along with 100 others who apparently made too much money. Right before the holidays (Oct 18th 2018). Corporate did a massive restructure to help the business. It used to be fun to work there. Now they make people work mandatory 10 hours days and weekends so they can get caught up from laying off all of those people. The morale and culture there went downhill. No one is happy because theres no room for advancement. If you're looking to get promoted don't apply. The mgmt is horrible and the training is awful. Everyone is pretty much out for themselves.
bad,"Unfair working place with traces of disorganization, no consistency, favoristim and micromanaging . Never felt like I was valued as an employee of the company , constantly reminded about what we do wrong , little to no regnocition at all for what you do right ."
bad,"poor product, difficult management to talk to, bad communication between schedulers and customers on delivering product, poor tools, delivery truck always breaking down and when it was was given a Uhaul which would create more stress and issues with customers"
bad,The only thing this place will do is brainwash you into thinking that you are to sell clients and experience they cannot afford and do not need. That a successful interaction with a client is all about getting them to open there wallets and take as much as you can from them.
bad,In Best Buy you cannot express your idea the manager only want to do what he supposed to do is No way you could think outside the box if you do have a creative idea they don't want to listen to you so I don't think is any growth in. working for retail Store like Best Buy that's my opinion.
bad,"Working for Best buy was at first a very pleasant experience till I realized how bad things were when I first started I was very excited to get to know the geek squad culture I was happy for the pay 13.50 to start and I was told it would be 15 by my six month mark my 6 month mark came and I was then told it would be 15 an hour after bonuses if we hit Everytime,I was for 4 months in a row the top performing agent and was still treated like trash and not offered consistent hours, they like to hire you part time and give you full time hours - benefits of being full time, everyone has been there for either 5+ years or is new and makes bad money. Very toxic place to work stay away"
bad,"I want to preface this by saying that this is my personal experience from working at Best Buy, not my view as a whole of the company itself. The location that I worked at was and still is, run by a management team that prefers favoritism over skill and competency as the reason you are able to advance. They would rather run you down and then run you out if the store manager doesn't like you instead of building up qualified people and retaining talent that in the long term would be more profitable to you and the store than the short term, narrow sighted-ness that the current management has."
bad,"Childish Leadership, Stressful, and next to no chance of progressing. Not willing to work with people when it pertains to scheduling (especially around the holidays)."
bad,"They keep getting cheaper, year by year. There is very little incentive to stay with a company that offers offers almost no growth potential, and is this cheap."
bad,"High turn over rates due to inexperienced, indifferent managers. Corporates expectations for stores are outrageous and unrealistic. Little to no growth opportunity within the company. Expect to work full time hours without full time benefits."
bad,The best thing happen to me while working at best buy is my last day working there I move on to better thing. A lot former employee have back 2000's and late 90's best buy was a great place to work at.
bad,This company wasnt really looking to move me forward bassed off of an opinon of one person. I would never recomend somone working here nor would I ever go back to this company.
bad,"For starters, I applied to be an Asset Protection Agent. Now, initially when this job was explained to me, they left out a large chunk of details."
bad,"Arrive at work"
bad,"The leadership lacked, hours were not flexible while in college.  When buying a warranty as an employee, your products was not valued and had to fight for what I purchased for."
bad,Going from 40+ hours the 14 hours a week with no notice is bad management. They allow certain employees too much freedom. Holidays are the worst time to work there
bad,Not worth my time.  My mother always said if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.  Therefore I don't have anything to say.  This manager made it horrible.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Place is an absolute joke, systems are terrible, will be no surprise if they are out of business within next 10 years.  Had no back office lead when I was hired so benefits never got enrolled, blamed on me.  Botched launch of galaxy s9, more customers left upset than happy.  Terrible inventory, lack of details on promotions so customers would come in 6 months later extremely upset.  Find another job if you want something legit."
bad,If you are looking to move up within a company this is not the place. They promote within their own circles. I have seen this at two different stores in the area.
bad,Lack of commitment to employers. No care to promote employees. Managers only care for employees to hit numbers so they get their big bonuses. People are not treated equal.
bad,"6 day work weeks, with the dangled possibility of a second day off if you can achieve an almost unattainable goal. The cars are working just enough to make it past the initial warrenty that only covers the drive train of the vehicle. In the past year the Fayetteville location has gone through 3 assistant sales managers, 4 sales managers, and an untold amount of sales reps. The one consistent element... The district manager that lives in the office. No wi-fi, no desktop access, no advertising budget, but a minimum of 6 online ad postings a day is still expected. This job will eat your soul, and the insurance isn't even good enough to make up for it."
bad,"COSTA MESA, Calif.: 11 July 2018 - Best Buy ranks highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers for a second consecutive year in a growing consumer market that is expected to reach $23.5 billion in 2018, according to the J.D. Power 2018 Appliance Retailer Satisfaction Study.SM"
bad,Great company and ethics but most of the stores are ran by mindless idiots that could care less how their employees felt and more and making their bonus.
bad,"i did not like best buy, it was a poor working environment in which to work and thrive. no place to go as far as upward management. poor performance evaluations"
bad,"during my time working at Best Buy there were more investigations into fraud from within management than there were any sort of positive leadership examples. You work when they want you to work, or you work elsewhere. The only place I've ever been chastised for having to take a restroom break at some point during my 10 hour shift."
bad,"Best Buy was one of the worst companies I have ever had to work for. The manager at the store I worked at in Douglasville, GA was very dishonest and corrupt. Management will do whatever it takes to keep their bonus even if it means keeping you on the employee list even if you have already quit. Not only that, but when I first got hired, they promised me $10.50 an hour and a few months later, I find out that they have been paying me only $10 an hour. Management does not care how you feel and are very cheap. Do not waste your time working for such a corrupt business."
bad,"allot of competition regarding credit card sales and that's all they cared for, it doesn't matter if you are a bad worker. As long as you sold cards then you are guaranteed the hours."
bad,I was hired for seasonal work and they provided very little training and want you to know what they want and expect without an actual mectric or standard to apply your work to.
bad,The positions are purely based on how much extra you can throw at customers instead of a true solution to a problem.a few good workers but over all would not go back.
bad,If you're looking for a temp job then maybe. The management is terrible. And their SOP is so backwards. Nothing is ever good enough and you can be at the top and fired the next day.
bad,This particular store did not take into consideration my skills and instead of rewarding my hard work I was passed and hours were constantly cut; I was constantly bypassed for promotions and instead lazy employees the favorites were rewarded
bad,i spent the latter part of my day receiving returned items to be sold as an open box item once returned..dealing with the public was the most enjoyable part of the job
bad,Sales goals are completely unrealistic. Frequent roleplays and early Sunday meetings about selling more stuff. You are expected to know every port of every device in the entire store and only get paid $10/hr . Managers will never tell you good job unless you convince a ton of people to sign up for the credit card. Even if you go above and beyond your only reward is a shirt. Nothing is ever good enough for the managers. You have to practice high pressure sales to get customers to buy things they don't want or need and you are told that you are terrible at your job if you accept no as an answer when you ask people to sign up for the credit card.
bad,"Perhaps I should blame myself for staying so long, but Best Buy was awful. Management does not respect your time and while they tout flexible scheduling, the reality is if you are a good worker they are going to abuse you. Promotional opportunities are entirely based around how good of friends you are with management."
bad,awful  place to work would never recommend it to anyone they treat there employers terribll and i will never go back to work for them ever again.  thx
bad,"Bad place to work. Last few years they have reduced their staff to half and still they hire ."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Management does not respect employees, terrible hours. very low pay with little to no chance for career advancement, little to no training on products you sell"
bad,I really don't have much to say about them I pretty much don't like the way they do business or how the treat there employees in the warehouse which is its no longer there.
bad,"a genuinely displeasant employee experience. the management focuses on being able to decieve the customer in to getting more than they need, by rewarding employees who can increase their revenue per hour, and employees who can get the customer to attempt to sign up for a credit card."
bad,"If you like to Suck up to the bosses for promotions, rather than being valued on the quality of your work, Best Buy is the place for you.  The bigger the suck up, the greater the reward for you.  Can't do your job because you don't have the tools you need?  Don't complain, or even mention it to the management here.  You'll just be reprimanded at a team meeting."
bad,"I worked at Bestbuy for several years and was treated horribly as a hard working employee. No recognition, no advancements in the company because of extreme favoritism and nepitism, management that are highly unqualified to be in leadership positions and incredibly unstable work hours. If you aren't a friend or family of management do not look to this company for a meaningful employment and growth experience."
bad,Horrible place to work with really bad management. They try to drive unrealistic sells goals and when they are not met they will punish you.This discount is good but still not worth it.
bad,Not a good place to work. No incentive to do work hard. Managers are very hard to please. Not very flexible with hours at all. Dealing with customers is not fun
bad,"Worked hard every day with no Advancement, encouragement, Management. Just got to my wits end with the way I and fellow co-workers were treated. It is no wonder how they will be swallowed by On-line retailers."
bad,Not a fun place to work. They pay is low. The benefits are terrible and overall it was not a good environment. The hours are terrible and they do not care about their employees.
bad,They have poor management service especially when dealing with the handicapped and when caught in the wrong they will use a lie to get out of it.  Poor management.
bad,"Management plays favorites. If you aren't in the popular crowd you get screwed over. It is like high school all over again. They push you to up sell but you don't make commission. The pray on the under educated and the older people because they can tell them what they ""need"". Someone may just need a 32"" TV for what they are asking and they will sell them a sound system and 55"" TV when they only watch the news."
bad,work load became to be unmanageable wouldn't have anyone to help us unload and stock shelves. at any given time i was working 15-17 hour shifts. with zero breaks
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for 2+ years. I started off as customer service in store and moved my way up to a Clerk in the DDC. My review is based off my experience while working at the DDC. "
bad,"The company did not mind throwing me under the bus for their own benefit. One moment they needed me and the next, they did not. Some of management were preticurly nice and fun to be around, while others clearly belonged at McDonald's flipping burgers"
bad,best buy as a company is qwesome i worked for the office opening new stores and it is not professional at all. the people are rude. managers will step on you to get promoted
bad,"No Flexible hours even if ""Part time"""
bad,Sailing and Promoting best Buy Products to the customers.The people were fun to be around but you have to know your product very well so you can explain to the customers just in case they ask about the product and want to purchase it
bad,"I worked here fresh out of High school. It was a great learning experience. It just was not the right job for me. The job was not a heard job. I just received a lot of hours I had to work, with little pay."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"very bad mangers did not work with you at all or help you achieve whatever you set out for yourself vauxhall, nj will forever be a bad best buy till they rehire old management or find new management"
bad,"The only wat to get hours was to kiss management butt, promotions are only given to those who kiss the most but, theres no commission but there is sales goals, disccounts are good but only for the BB brand Insignia"
bad,"Everyone has there own opinion so good luck. "
bad,Time was short but unfulfilling. No security or even choice of area to work in. Had to work with cameras when i knew more about computers and televisions.
bad,"There are many bad things I can say about this job, but there really is no point. I will be leaving due to managements utter abuse of power, lack of hours, not enjoyable,under appreciated, and no advancement."
bad,"A typical work day at best buy was OKAY. The management is extremly passive aggressive. They always gave me the run around every time i ask them for a development plan for advancement. They never gave me 100% of there time. The fact that there was about 5-6 managers on duty, no one was ever on the same page. They played a lot of favoritism which did not sit well with me. However; The work environment overall was good. My Co-workers were great and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job i would say was, dealing with management."
bad,"You can't make a living working at Best Buy. This is a job for kids and college students. fun place to work, if you are young. No room for advancement, and culture stinks"
bad,"was wrongfully terminated, all due to a scheduling computer glitch, i was subjected to a peer review and won. however i was later fired wrongfully again out of spite."
bad,Although no comission is offered Bestbuy pushes you to sell $700 an hour and if you are below the ridiculous quota your hours get cut. Management is very poor and unreliable. I have had coworkers with families and mortgages be fired on the spot for not pushing sales.
bad,While I worked there I did not get a job raise until I told them I was leaving and even then it was a 50 cent raise because I was very good at my job. I did only stayed there because I was a college student.
bad,I never felt like the company took care of there employees. I was consistently given 38 hours a week for the majority of the time I was employees at best buy .but never given a full time position. never giving me any benefits but still working me as much as Possible
bad,"Overall poor experience and wasted 5 Year’s of my life there when I could have explored better options with other companies. Pay is terrible, management was uninspiring and shady"
bad,Only choose to work here if you have given up on life and want to die fast. Otherwise take your talents to a more deserving company that cares about its employees.
bad,"Best Buy was a cut throat, stressful job with very low pay and few benefits. the managers are incentivized to put pressure on their team with low return on the actual workers. favortism is everywhere and those on the low end are often cut out of hours."
bad,Mario the manager is being protected by regional management because he is a womanizing individual that has no clue about the technologies that go into the products that BB sells and yet he continues to lead a destination store without any recourse.  What's worse is that he is the longest standing manager at this location in it's entire history.
bad,"They are a company that needs to get a better training program, and they need to get better stock control.They need better staff Training this would make a better company."
bad,customer are great to work with but almost everything else is negative.  no matter how much you achieve you are never given any credit for what you success.  The whole staff is very discontent with working there and the technology you have to use is so out of date.  benefits are pretty expensive for minimal coverage.  the management team is cut throat and is very do as i say not as i do school of management.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Not worth applying to because they dont care about your job there they will cut you and replace you in a heartbeat. you are not treated with respect there unless you are extremely close with the managers or related to them.
bad,"Its more like a High school setting experience"
bad,disgusting. do not work here. Find some place else to work. They do not pay well. very mens. they are complicit. They don't care about their customers or employees. only profits.
bad,On the day of my 5th year with the company they let me go and would not say why... Job security is the worst at that place. People minus managers are nice though.
bad,"Being forced to lie to customers, falsify information, having coworkers threaten you, managers that abuse substances on their breaks, these are just a few of the awful things I endured during my time with Best Buy/Geek Squad."
bad,Management was awful and advancement opportunities didn’t exist only given to out of store employees instead of promoting from within. Schedule was never kept!
bad,would not recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a job.   they will throw you under the bus to save them no matter what.   you be better off working at walmart then here
bad,Company is throwing money away and instead of fixing their problems they are doing everything they can to cover them up. Instead of taking care of employees they just replace them anytime there is an issue.
bad,"The Albany location is a terrible place to work. From poor management, to them not caring a lick about you as a person, they only care about hitting their numbers and making sure they get credit card applications out. Not a great place to work in my eyes at all. Managers do not care, they will make you stay longer if they dont have a position filled for that day or will make you run a section by yourself that should have 2-3 other employees in it."
bad,"not even worth reviewing. not the best job , not the best company, not the best discounts, not the best environment, not the best culture, not the best pay!"
bad,I was not treated fairly at Best Buy since I started working there. I wouldn't recommend anyone working here. The managers don't know how to treat nor how to talk to employees.
bad,I am just like not a huge big fan of best buy. There is limited growth and pay is not great at all. I would recommend anyone looking to work for best buy to seek employment elsewhere.
bad,best buy was terrible. they would change your work days and hours on your days off and not tell you. it was never about the workers and always about making numbers for corporate. terrible place
bad,"no thank you I would not recommend working here , I don't want to work for that company Im glad I don't and I wouldn't reccomend my friends to work there either"
bad,This job will easily consume your life. you will not have any free time and if you are a college student forget about making your studies your main priority.
bad,"geek squad, so whack. how is it still around.  prety much, sell the package best buy wants for the week. hook up all machines to a VLAN and someone else works on it."
bad,liked working their and the people are nice to be with. they only care about what is good for them some times they don't treat you the way u wanted to be treated.
bad,"I learned that salaried leadership does not concern themselves with less paid individuals. There is no team effort, instead there is the sales floor, and the operations team, and they do not work as one team."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"cheating the customer and giving them false information for them to buy their warranties. "
bad,"One of the worst companies I've ever worked for. they do not care about what their employee ideas are. Everything is top down. Managers do not care how their ideas implicate your job, even if its in a negative way. "
bad,Working at Best Buy was a bitter sweet experience.  Everything was ok until a manager was hired from without the company instead of with in the company.  We had a very easy dress code that reflected our job position there.  When Best Buy DDC 715 decided to merge with Geek Squad and change the policies around that when everything went downhill.
bad,Worked there for 6 years.  I saw alot of things.  That place is entirely favoritism.  You wont advance if youre not best friends with the boss.  If you make an hr claim against the GM they will fire you
bad,Best Buy isn't as fun of a great place to work as they make it seem. Hours were only given to the stores favorite employees and many weeks I received 1 or 2 days because favorite employees received 40 plus hours
bad,"Working with customers on promotional sales and educating them on the equipment. Mostly with cell phones since I was in that department. Working with all carriers such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile."
bad,"Never again. That's all that needs to be said. Never again. Terrible business and hiring practices, the sales goals don't make sense, the management only cares about what makes their life easy and corporate doesn't know how to run the stores properly. If I ran a business the way BestBuy runs business I'd be out of business. Never again!"
bad,"Disrespected by my bosses, I would be locked out of using the computer because of mistakes. I wouldn't know until I went to work and then I had to hunt down a manager who knew what was going on  while my staff suffered because I couldn't help them out. Discount was great but don't do this job longer then four years."
bad,"Only good thing is the employee discount, otherwise run away. Be expected to work hard for low pay, and have no support from management. Company says you are not commission based, but if you do not sell enough credit cards and or low grade products will be ostracized. Also, supervisors normally sleep with employees."
bad,"Couldn’t stress this enough, do not work here. Literally an awful place to work. Terrible pay and lack luster coworkers. Unless you enjoy ripping people off apply somewhere else."
bad,Bad manager. Cut throat!!!!!!!!! Never work there!!! Like a bunch of kids!!!!! Don’t waste your time!!!!! Don’t have your back!!!! Unfair pay!!!! Favoritism!!!!!
bad,Best Buy is a terrible company to work for..it is just like any other major retailer greedy and only cares about themselves..forget about the employees at store level who do all the real work
bad,bad communication between employees and managers. didnt feel like the employer was for the workers. didnt recieve enough hours to maintain a household
bad,"Great people, like a family, work life balance, contests, treats, good money, fun customers, great upper management, fun shifts, great hours, team work"
bad,I hated this place. It was not willing to find the problem only restore back to factory and charge for data recovery. The pay sucked. Only good thing to come out of this was the discount
bad,"Terrible GM who cared nothing for his employees. Job that expected top results without reward and punished less than perfect results. Forced to leave family event on thanksgiving day to prep for a 20 hr Black Friday shift or be threatened with being ""blacklisted"" if you were late or didn't show up."
bad,"I feel that this was a good college type job. Would not recommend for someone looking for a career. I learned that if 1 person has a problem it may be that person, however when multiple people have the same problem, it may be the company."
bad,Legitimately such a lack of communication and training provided. No commission structure. Close to min wages for long hours and no hope of advancement.
bad,"I got fired from Best Buy Here Pay Here car sales because i was in the hospital getting diagnosed with Crohns disease and was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then had to be at home for 2 weeks resting. the day before i was suppose to go back to work, they called me and told me that i needed to come get my things that i was no longer an employee there."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"find anything else if you can! poor hours, only supervisors and management work full time, I was never offered full time hours, and when you exit best buy, or quit, or just leave like I did because I found out I could never get a reference to find employment in any other field, but I found better employment opportunities, and I'm happier for leaving best buy, making $600 a month? How would anyone survive."
bad,Was not fairly paid the hours were too long and they took advantage of the fact that we were really young and gave us most of the work load and the assistant managers were really mean
bad,Just a place to work you down. All of your accomplishments are unnoticed management is awful. Hard to move up within the company. Management is hardly present and when they are they don't do much other than complain.
bad,"Have you ever heard of a pyramid scheme?  With Best Buy you only get perks if you sale above and beyond you daily goal. Your daily goal can be as high as 11,000 per day!  No lie."
bad,Enjoyable place to work. Fast paced so the time went by quickly.Other employees worked well together and as a team. Management team was good to work with and they had a extended  amount of training for the job.
bad,"At the time I worked, it was on elf the worst place I ever worked for. I hated the management, company's rule, and lack of benefits. Things may have changed since I've left, but at the time I had to resign from the stress the management would lay on their employees."
bad,The job was over worked other employees did nothing I did most of the work they would not give a raise managment didnt do there job boss was always flirting with other employees
bad,Don't do it. They don't train you nearly enough for you to survive and half the time they expect too many things from you. Not even the discounts are worth working there.
bad,"Bad place to work for. Write you up for being sick,management is horrible, very cut throat no one has respect for each other. I stopped bringing in lunch because some one else eats it."
bad,Constantly screaming and putting down employees. Bullying from lower management and upper management does nothing about it.Never know what time you are getting off. Work is not consistent. Was told we are temp to hire but let go when it got slow.
bad,Strong emphasis on the hard sell and overselling. Management is often petty and concerned with undermining other management as a means to overshadow their own insecurities.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, management had poor communication with associates if any. Most would just mingle among themselves in the computer room until paged."
bad,"There are no benefits and employees are treated like cattle.  For someone still attending school or fresh out of school, it might be an OK place to work, but it quickly becomes evident that they do not care about their employees."
bad,This is the single worst company I have ever worked for. My job is threatened at minimum once a day. Managements expectations are unrealistic and we are constantly reminded of how worthless we are for not meeting them. We are encouraged to outright lie to customers in order to make sales and sign people up for credit cards. The pay is static although they will tell you that a raise is built in after a years working there. Numerous HR complaints have been made about certain  managers and literally nothing has been done. Some managers even brag about how many HR complaints they have. The discount is okay for certain small items like cables and phone cases but is virtually nonexistent for any and all big ticket items. The GM of my particular store is a diagnosable sociopath who regularly informs us of how little he cares about us as people. Some of the customers are okay. There are no enjoyable parts of this job. The only reason I haven't left is because every job I've been offered in the past 2 years either didn't pay as well or paid the same with added responsibility.
bad,I have too much to say about this bad company. Do not work here unless your in high school and College. You will not advance. Its kids managing kids. They do not care to see you grow or advance in the company.
bad,I really dislike working for this company it was a very cut-throat and competitive type of environment with no one taking responsibility for any of the mistakes that were made
bad,"At first it seems cool working at best buy, then reality sets in. Management expects you to get 100 different things done all at once and gives NO support. They sit in their office and ignore everything. Actually listened to the managers over the radios argue about who was going to help with a customer because they ""had to deal with them last time"" and finally if you bring up that you are having difficulty doing your job because of their lack of support they set up a meeting to tell you that you aren't living up to the best buy standard and tell you that you can put in your 2 weeks or they will put through to HR to have you fired"
bad,"Unless you need something to pay the bills, even then don't stay long. Management team is toxic and the stores run on childish nonsense. Unethical business practices."
bad,"A ring of managers prey on new employees and steal money from registers at night.  Lack of accountability and nothing was done to, contacting HR also did nothing."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I learned a lot about the newest technology and how to handle any situation I'm put in. I learned about how to work and teach others how to use everything best buy sells.
bad,"Management plays favorites, very rude, talk about employees behind backs. Very fake. Rude. They help employees they like personally get better positions and better pay, as opposed to giving it to someone with seniority and experience."
bad,Stressful and poorly managed at every level.  You were not considered and individual you were considered an employee number and expected to be a scripted individual.
bad,"managers were very pushy about getting ""the sale"""
bad,Give ONLY a 30 min break whether you work 6 hours or 10. Poor Management. Poor training. You learn a lot about technology though. Very unorganized and treat their employees terribly.
bad,"horrible job,this job is for people who are in the best shape,if you are over weight in any way this job is not for you,it is very fast past and the hours or unlimited"
bad,"The Geek Squad Customer Experience group was shut down. it no longer is around, but the other offices at Installs that were kept where horrendous to say the least."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I've ever worked, and I worked at multiple locations. Management seems to be trained in the style of ""power tripping"" and being generally ignorant and rude."
bad,"this job was the worst job I've ever had, the scheduling the support being expected to put in free time. it was just a lot of expectations for little pay"
bad,Management was not friendly to say the least and salary was poor.
bad,"Really mean managers that are always angry. Working while understaffed with a bad printer and an extremely small warehouse is hard. Extreme turnover rate, this job chews you up and spits you out."
bad,Receipt checkers and greeters. They do not want you stopping anyone and with that stupid headset on everyone knows what is going on in the store. They want you to kill the suspect with kindness rather then making a stop and prosecuting them for shoplifting/larceny...complete waste of time.
bad,"Was a full time associate, as a part time job it isn't really worth the stress, delivery is awful, manager at the Greenwood store is lazy and isn't hands on whatsoever, pushes issues off on co workers and hides in the back and watches movies and follows the GM around goofing off while you get swamped, pay is okay but for the amount of stress of the job, the quotas, and the orders and customers you have to deal with it eventually isn't worth it. The systems they use are broken and the company doesn't handle issues in a personal fashion, taking weeks to resolve them with inexperienced delivery and customer service staff on the other end of things. The escalations you have to send up are a joke. You're constantly pushed to hound customers the moment they walk into the department."
bad,"Bosses dont care about you. No job security. Low wages. Coworkers are pleasant but lack of professionalism displayed by management makes the entire experience of working with Geek Squad a nightmare. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
bad,Management spent most of their day drinking at the bar next door then would come to work smelling of alcohol on a daily basis. She constantly threatened people.
bad,"They hide these kinds who form click's and if your not part of the click you get treated like garbage. Your experience goes unnoticed, poor communication, yelled at if you help assist customers."
bad,the best buy in cortlandt manor is disgusting everyone is very unprofessional everyone there dating each other. i wouldn't recommend working there the management is just as bad
bad,"I worked with this company for 6 years, and should've quit earlier, because they are terrible to work for. They do not care about their employees at all, and prefer sucking up to management, over hard work. They do not reward hard work, but instead will reward you if you pretend that you love the place and it is like your family, regardless if you are even good at your job. There is so much favoritism there and the pay is horrible. I will say that the benefits are good though. That is one main reason I stayed there as long as I did."
bad,"Well had to take test for first two weeks which where stupid and meaningless ; didn't need it had retail experience  to begin with ; You also had to shadow an employer with no blue shirt on , got tired of customers asking me who are you and why are you following me and went through this every day for the first two months !!!! One week your on schedule the next week your not ! No good when you have a family to support !!! Kyle Mckenana was a terrible manger ! He would yell at you in front of customer if your shirt was hanging out a little bit instead of pulling you over to the side and not trying to emberace you in front of customers !!! He showed me he had a poor additude and unenexperince manger with no job skill behind his character to his employes !!! On the other hand Stewart general mgr , was just the oppisite and great skills and a pleasure to work with and would take time to help you out !!!! There was no help also by team leader ; allways to busy to answer your question or show you any assistance with anything !!! This is your Hamburg store in Buffalo New York !!! My suggestion this store needs lots of help in there mgnt dept !!!! This store can be so more succsessfull and more productive !"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,the job was a nice job but the management was horrible and they didnt let you take long breaks which wasnt very fair wouldnt reccomend it to anybody else
bad,"Very strict management, not very upbeat. Most staff isn't very knowledgeable in not just general technology but their own department. I suggest someone realizes a new approach because I really don't see the benifit of buying from Best Buy over Amazon."
bad,I did not enjoy my time while working for Best Buy.  Working in the warehouse they work you like slaves.  You can work a 12 hour shift and they will not give you any break.
bad,Best Buy does not care about your well being or you wanting to take care of your family they hire off the street and don't look at the potential employees have
bad,I just definitely wouldn't recommend picking this as a career unless you're wanting something part-time or just temporary that maybe this is for you but it was definitely on organized unprofessional and under management
bad,Not a good work environment the leaders outside the gm are horrible and they don't treat their people good at all.  big mistake coming here . should have stayed where i was at
bad,"Frankly i am looking for a job, not some place to write reviews for no pay. there should be an option to skip this, especially considering I still have other employers to ""rate"""
bad,"The brand is terrible. The company was great at it's entrepreneurial spirit, but the culture of sales people was such that there was an inherent alpha dog mentality in management and the end result is ultimately that the brand sucks. I left and stopped shopping there."
bad,"Worked in data recovery, it was a stressful job with very demanding aspects. Management was unhelpful and employees there tried to get temps fired as soon as they came aboard"
bad,"Lack of hours and if you dont meet the sale requirements or if managers dont like you for whatever reason no matter how well you do the work required, they will do anything necessary to try to get rid of you."
bad,A typical day includes being fussed at by the employer. I didn't learn much at this company. Management was harsh and did not give many hours. The job wasn't a hard job.
bad,"mauvais service, traite les clients d'illettrés en ce sentait puissant et ce valorise en insultant les clients, même le gérant fait ça devant tout le monde !!! ya une façon de dire les choses mais le gérant je ne sais pas ce qu'il fait a travailler dans le servie au public, change de job, va travailler enfermé dans un bureau ou tu as pas affaire a la clientèle si tu est pour traiter tes clients comme de la marde !!!!!"
bad,Management was poorly organized and did not clearly indicate what was wanted. Frequently told employees one thing and did another. As well as telling other employees different things per employee. Talked down on employees and talked behind your back. I did/do not enjoy working here. Time management of corporate levels down to the store level is poor as well. We would get an amount of things to change (planograms) and not be able to do them all in the week due to being severely understaffed.
bad,"I've always dreamed of working at Best Buy ever since I was a little kid because the store seemed like a cool and enjoyable place to be. Low and behold, I land a job there and the VERY first day I wanted to quit because of management having the unrealistic expectation of first-timers doing everything perfectly. Even as you improve and do your job sufficiently, they will still find faults within you. The store doesn't value its employees and treats them like disposable numbers, the culture is competitive and stressful because it's sales driven instead of team driven, and the constant threat of being fired looms overhead even from the simplest of mistakes. Breaks are also too short if you don't like bringing a lunch with you and would rather get one from somewhere else. Quite simply, Best Buy has forgotten that their employees are human and expect them to sell their lives for it."
bad,An overrated company who lives off of its fake reputation to lure unsuspecting prospects into employment. You're constantly overworked and every year you run the risk of being laid off by them.
bad,"the job was pretty easy and the customers were fantastic, but the managers thought treating their employees with disrespect and insulting was the best way to motivate. there was never a chance to advance in the company no matter how hard you work and never called off or showed up late. this job would have been fantastic without these things"
bad,the location in hollywood had very bad training processes. included very low pay and was not giving a chance to move up in the company. and a stressful time at that location.
bad,The management and pay was horrible. The managers would just walk around the store talking about partying. Were not focused on the day to day operations.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,enjoyed working there however management was very unprofessional and not friendly at all. the customers were okay but other than that it was too much work
bad,"Poor compensation for the work expectations was a key issue with Best Buy. They were more than pleased to have a revolving door of employees."
bad,The management is very bad their.and so is the supervisors.the management treats you like dogs.and i would never tell any body to work their.doing what i like doing working in the warehouse.a typical day at work? not good!!!.black peoples got treated the worse.and talked down to by white peoples.and the most enjoyable part of the job was going home for the day.
bad,"I was happy to leave this place. I was the top seller in my department, consistently, week after week. But was repeatedly refused for a pay raise. They hired someone for me to train, and hired them with higher pay than me. I quickly found a new job."
bad,This placed sucked.  You don't get raises.  The pay starts at 9.50.  They don't do commission so you have to bank on getting a bonus which was non existent when I was working there.  Management sucked.  I just hated the place.  No one ever kept their promises to the associates
bad,"One of the worse places I have worked.  Management is insanely bad. It's a half decent place to work if you've never had a job before, other than that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
bad,"I learned a lot through the training program. However, once placed in the store management was quickly changed. Hours scheduled were not what was stated."
bad,"This company offered my a job as a perm employee but decided to let everyone go due to budget cuts. This is a cut-through company, and I feel sorry for you if you have to work here. The people that worked there were great, and even as unstable of a job this is it's still pretty fun to work there."
bad,If you get a position with geek squad learn as much as you can and then get out of the door. It is low wage and they definitely underpay. Management is horrendous and can make you want to leave immediately. Talk to customers to network and find other opportunities.
bad,This was one of the worst jobs ever. At first I was very excited to find a full time job right out of college but they use that to work you when the feel like it
bad,This was the worst place I ever worked they were never able to get the schedule straight and there was clearly a lack of professionalism in the management.
bad,"Job for high schooler, not the best pay and hours aren't great. Not much business only during towards the end of the year. Only good thing are discounts on products"
bad,I rally have nothing positive to say about best Buy. It's retail. The culture sell as much as the customer will be willing to pay. Management is poor and advancement is basically who is the bosses drinking buddy.
bad,I liked my job and my co workers but management was very rude and they had their favorites. Everyone was treated differently. You are expected to do another persons job instead of the management stepping up to help out.
bad,"Terrible management, co-workers and hours. Save yourself the trouble and apply at a better Best Buy, especially one where it doesn't look like the store is a flea market."
bad,Very fast paced environemtn with a lot of people and delegaton. The peopole were very lousy and did not want to train. The senior management was very bad as well
bad,"It's an okay place to work if you have no individuality and are willing to sell your soul to the company. They are extremely greedy and are willing to hire people that are shady and promote people that are incompetent. However, the job is very very easy to do and they are flexible with schedules."
bad,This company ended my employment due to a mistake made by management but blamed on the employee. Management discounted an open boxed item and because it was against the policy I paid the consequences. Very poor management and a horrible company to work for.
bad,horrible pay. fast paced. stressful. terrible leadership. a sinking ship. a company that does not care about its employees what so ever. management is terrible.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"They constantly change procedures and it can be confusing and frustrating. Even though employees do not work on commission, the management forces employees to work like they are. They no longer want what is best for the customer, but what is best for the bottom line. Stay away."
bad,"Usual retail experience not much else to say about it. Management micro manage and not try to be leaders, Customers tend to get stressful, Not paid enough for all your hard work and no recognition"
bad,They are still operating on a inventory management system from the early 90s. The management is generally useless and they will only try to use you. Get out while you can!
bad,It wasnt a good place to work.  They didnt work with my school schedule or my other job. If i got there late because of my other job they hated it. If i asked for more work they gave me to much.
bad,Leave if you're part time. Not a tech job if you think it is... cap out at $18 an hour...thats after you worked 6 years... Its a sales job. You get to wear a clip on tie and be geeky... and discounts are good on phone chargers and car stuff...that's about it.
bad,Do not work at Best Buy!!  Absolutely the worst company to work for.  Nothing but favoritism and harassment on the store level.  And if you dare report it you WILL pay the price!
bad,"Good job if youre in school, but not good for the long-term. Not very good at working around your schedule. Slim to none oppertunity for raise or bonus."
bad,pushed to top sell even though the customer wanted a lesser brand and your hours were cut due to not top selling the only thing I like was the discount
bad,"This location, the staff were rude, the incentives and motivation were lacking to say the least. They cared nothing for work/life balance and falsely offer you promotions."
bad,"As with all retail based jobs, Geek Squad was very difficult to work with. Fluctuating hours means fluctuating pay. Managers would rather you lose a customer trying to sell them a $200 service they don't want, instead of selling them a cheaper service they would be willing to purchase."
bad,"They did not hire me back after I had to take leave. Run by people with mentality of High Schoolers. I hated the people, I hated the products, hated downstocking when there are others that do this, hated janitorial duties, hated the customers hated everyone."
bad,"nothing good to say about this job at all. unequal pay, corrupt management, poor discount. i learned nothing good from this job at all except for the work enviorment i DONT want"
bad,"I've been working here for almost three years, took awhile to move up in the company but after about a year I was able to move up to supervisor. This job has given many tools and experiences to have for my tool kit of future en devours."
bad,"Highly recommend not working at best buy, unless of course you like for your whole life to revolve around work. Hard to take time off, lots of meetings, and the holidays."
bad,"I'm only reviewing the Dothan, Alabama store but it is not a very good place to work. The management is really bad and overbearing. The compensation is not very good either. Work hours fluctuate so much that it is very difficult to make this your primary job."
bad,"This company is by far the worst I have ever worked for. Not only do they promote individuals who do not have the experience or the motivation to take on responsibilities.  They hire many and all but the individuals who do show them that they have potential and whom have great work ethic are over worked, taken advantage of and over looked once promotional positions become available."
bad,I wasn't only a seasonal hire for the holidays. I still have nightmares about that Black Friday I spent there. 12 hours of standing in one place because it was so crowded you couldn't move. At one point I went to go to the bathroom and it took me an hour to walk there and back because of all the people
bad,"Managers walked around always giving hard looks and saying unpleasant things about vendors and their owned employees"
bad,"everyone in management is before their promotions, they do not care about the employees of their company, they give tons of hassle to employees without any reason every day, this is just for a south common store, Edmonton. the management is worst and I do not know what word I can use beyond worst."
bad,I stayed becuase I was good at it. Management is always changing. Directives are unclear. Customer stopped being first a long long time ago. Do this at your own risk
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,This place is full of non it people that are in direct control of IT people. This is not good because i know far more then my manager who does not even have a 2 year as i do and promotions are done by who you are friends with in management. i was passed on 2 promotion that others had 0 experience or degrees in. VERY BAD
bad,"Best Buy may seem like the ideal place to work for anyone who enjoys technology and an ever- changing field. However, this location in Jackson, TN is far from the technology lovers dream. The management is poor, unfair, and always shows favoritism despite the fact that they say otherwise. Managers are never to be found when an employee needs them and the manager will always contradict the employee and make them feel stupid and undervalued. If at all possible, avoid this place as a working environment."
bad,Worst job ever no care for their employees all they care about is their sells. Sen them fire people left and right for not making sells for itemd people would never need or use.
bad,I didnt like working at Best Buy. The company is more focused on upper management and it shows in how their reps are helping customers. I have had people try to sell me things like Android phones just to boost profit or commission instead of providing what I wanted.
bad,great working with electronics and it cool to communicate with people that loves electronics as well. I enjoy showing my product knowledge. its an great place to work/
bad,"Best Buy was one of the few places I always wanted to work in my teenage years. It catered to everything I wanted to surround myself with and the employees seemed like they were enjoying themselves."
bad,"I did not know who was worst the management team or staff members.  They violate company policy and procedures, punishment, transfer to another store."
bad,No one cared about each other there. You didn't have scheduled breaks. You had to wait until someone was available to cover. Which conveniently no one was. management took their time to help resolve issues with customers and employees.
bad,"High schoolers only need to apply. no room to move up.Upper management is something you'll never reach. They dont allows you to have a set schedule, dont promote within, and much more. Nothing good to say here except they sell great items that people love."
bad,Non receptive managerial staff that would much rather force the store's credit card or product protection warranty on anyone with a pulse rather then actually assisting them in any form or fashion.
bad,"I worked here for two years. In my first year I moved up quickly but the more you're at work the more you realize you're managers only care about sales and making money. I dropped down to part time and had my hours cut so bad. I went from working 40 hours a week to 15 in a couple of months. After holiday season was over I wasn't scheduled for 2 months and got terminated because they didn't have enough labor hours. I can't move to a different store because they're isnt enough labor hours! Thanks Best Buy, you really screwed me over. "
bad,horrid place to work find another form of employment. Good for college students only. Do not make a career out of this company
bad,"Poor leadership, no commission, ridiculous sales goals, poor work hours, no opportunity for advancement unless you are willing to show loyalty to childish managers."
bad,"Worked at Best Buy as my first job in high school. They were not willing to accommodate with my schooling and I was scheduled to work nearly every day of the week even after explaining that I couldn't. The pay is minimum wage which is fine if it's just a part time job. Management was absolutely awful. Treated people so poorly and were so full of themselves, and so were the employees. No one was willing to help at all."
bad,"Not good, horrible communication, routes suck, too much heavy lifting, over 10+ hours a day, bad weather , not enough pat, not the greatest benefits just don't apply"
bad,"open at 9am"
bad,Nothing about this job was attractive. You could make more money part time at McDonalds. I worked with entitled kids. The schedule was horrible. Working every holiday
bad,"Corporate jobs are usually selfish, do not care about their employees. It wasn't a job for me. Customers were rude as well as employees. Unhappy working environment."
bad,"I don't know where to begin. Filthy talk about anything . Management losing Big screen tv's, Laptops because of poor organization. Big screen tv's 50 inch get sent to damage department. They don't check them, they just write them off. In repack, they would come to work and be told that it was going to be a 12 to 14 hr day Not caring about their personal life of needing to find child care for longer. This may help you decide. 41 employees quit in one day because of being misled. The pay is good, Should be better. No respect or acknowledgment from management. : ("
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Absolutely hated every minute of this place, they hire thieves and offenders. The management at bestbuy was absolutely terrible. And all of the great benefits and bonuses they tell you about disappear."
bad,Nothing but ladder climbers in this company that will do whatever it takes to get above the next and where your best is never good enough.
bad,"i was at a hood one and they didnt know how to act , foreal foreal."
bad,"Manage day to day operations and daily sales "
bad,"Worst place to work. Managers are allowed to cuss and yell at employees and not hold the right people accountable. As soon as they feel you are a threat they will find a way to get rid of you. The worst Best Buy to work is the Best Buy on Outer Loop in Louisville, KY. The culture in the place is horrible. The operations manager does not do his job and lets the warehouse get out of hand. The sales team can not sell things because all the product is either locked up in ridiculous places or in the warehouse. This company has become one of the worst places to work at."
bad,the only good thing about this job is it gave me the experience to go get a better paying sales job and let me get my feet wet in sales which allowed me to build experience to excel later in my career.
bad,"My experience there was awful. I was a few months post partum and they did not treat me well. The hours were terrible. They showed favoritism and always made me work hours past my scheduled time. They didnt train me but told me I could train myself at home, giving up time I spent with my newborn son. I wouldn't work there again to save my life"
bad,"poor communication...very bad experience doesn't care about their employees, managers make up their own policy doesn't follow company guild lines, you can get fired for no reason."
bad,bad place to work...do not work here....bad pay.... no commission... only 1 bonus per year... micro-managers.
bad,its was good at first...management plays favorites. if you haven't been there since they've opened then you get treated differently then those who've been there longer
bad,"I was working for Best Buy Warehouse. I enjoyed working for Best Buy but the supervisors are not trained not respectful, rude, and not appreciative of the hard work everyone does. I put my 2 week notice because of the supervisors were treating me unfair. Better if i left."
bad,"Positive Outlook"
bad,"one of the worst places i have ever worked there."
bad,"This place is bad to work at I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. The hours are terrible. Again bad hours. I would never ever work there again."
bad,"you can never move up at this job. management has favorites so no matter how hard you work, how loyal you are to the company, no matter how reliable, compassionate etc. you will aways remain at the bottom unless you dont mind kissing a little butt to get what you need."
bad,"poor management poor planning work is easy but its bad when  "
bad,"when i first started i googled how employees felt about the company and i was horrified to see such a storm of bad reviews, surely this would not reflect my experience unfortunately that pretty much exactly what happened the store was unorganized the managers were petty, on one occasion a manager stole my water bottle"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Typical day at Best Buy was working only 4 hrs a day when I lived 30 minutes from the store. I definitely have a lot of product knowledge on all aspects of technology, however I taught everything to myself because no one trains you. Management is horrible.I remember that my manager told me that I was replaceable and thats why they don't care about their employees. I had a great co-workers and thats probably why the job was bearable. There was nothing hard about the job only thing that was hard was dealing with the Corporate changes that made the company lose over $10k of merchandise every week, because they decided to leave product out in the open for people to take. The most enjoyable was being to come to work and work with some great people. My co-workers were amazing."
bad,Terrible managers. They scam people for a living. Shop online in their office. They do no work but get paid all the money.
bad,"putting out new releases and shipping back overstock"
bad,"Could not pay my rent with this job sock's working  for this company due to not getting payed right. Had many different positions, at one time."
bad,During the interview I thought this would be a fun place to work and that it'd give me some decent hours. Wrong! The first week I got about 35 hours being part time. The next week I had 6 hours. Well you cannot afford to make/pay bills that way.
bad,I worked for Best Buy for 4 yrs and it was the worst job experience I have had. The company pays by the hour by treats its employees as if they work on commission. Sales are tracked and more hours of work are given to those with higher sales. Growth in the company is almost impossible unless you know someone. The only plus side to working for a this company is the discount.
bad,Learning about all cellular technologies and companies that ever change. The environment was very relaxed and not really hands on.
bad,"I moved from California to Georgia in 2005.  Geek Squad was my first job out here in my new environment."
bad,management was horrible. did not show interest in what we need or want to perform our jobs correctly. Managers cussed out employees. no one was h appy
bad,"This is one job i would recommend to no one. This company as a whole is great but this store is unprofessional, ghetto, and down right rude to customers as well as employees."
bad,"I have worked for the Best Buy Warehouse in Woodridge, IL  for 10 years."
bad,there is no consistency and company values change way often before whats in place a chance to work. no job security no matter how good and valuable you are.
bad,"People are underpaid and overworked, that is when they get a few hours to work. Managers were not nice and did not make it a comfortable experience. They do not promote diversity in the workplace and it seems like they often do not care what is going on."
bad,Horrible company to work for. More focused on why we didn't make sales goals when competition online blew us away. Complete restructuring lead to a change in the management that actually cared about the worker. No room for advancement.
bad,Taught to harass people about buying services for their products. Not very friendly. Low pay and not exciting environment.
bad,"No skills required, no support for new hires, not enough advancement to keep employees, lack of teamwork and no sense of community."
bad,I hated working for this company. The managers show favoritism to some employers. The pay sucks for what is expected out of you. Everyone always complains about working there.
bad,The retail world is great for some but not all.  The inconsistency of scheduling makes for a difficult life-work balance.
bad,As a warehouse worker I was the backbone of the store that busted my butt while dealing with lazy sales associates and putting myself through college
bad,"very stressful"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Well thats simple. It grows off the hard work of the lowest level employee until they quit. I have worked for Bestbuy twice now... and both times... simply due to the culture and environment of two completely different stores, I had to walk-out. I didn't just quit after a week... I applied for a home theater position and inside was forced into a mobile device spot. They claimed they needed people badly, which they did because it was the most difficult and strenuous position in the store. I stayed in that position for about 2 months after being told over and over that it would be just one more week... there were negotiations... and then finally... like a bunch of genius, they fail miserably on a schedule... solo... weekend... no support... no backup. An entire store of people AND employees... and nothing. You no what happens next. not for 9 bucks at least for me."
bad,"Working here is only a good option for someone with very few to no bills to pay, no desire for advancement, who doesn't need good pay or benefits. Management doesn't care about its employees and provides no incentive for exceptional employees."
bad,unorganized micro management hours are crazy no work life balance mostly immature young people working there managers mistreat sales people
bad,"A completely hostile work environment. Poor pay. Completely unwilling to schedule your work around your life. Next to no training for new hires, and with the way they are cutting positions and payroll they will be lucky to have any stores open in 2 years. Definitely not senior or female friendly either. If your young and don't speak your mind then you're their kind of moldable play toy action sales floor figure."
bad,"Typical day at work included watching live camera feed of the store, apprehending shop lifters, greeting and helping customers."
bad,"Working under some of the management was tedious at times because they rolled over the management team which seemed like every month. However the people I worked with were nice, I do not like the business plan of the company."
bad,"I worked at the Best Buy in Jackson, MI and my experience was terrible. They think inappropriate jokes, touching, and harassment are totally normal and the supervisors party and get drunk with the sales associates. My Team Lead had a kid with another Team Lead after a party together and she constantly spoke poorly of him, as he did of her, and the gossip never stopped. I worked Mobile and ended up activating phones on the first day; so I never really got training, I just had to beg everyone to show me how to do things. Everything I learned about the plans and phones I taught myself by doing research. I would not suggest working here to anyone."
bad,"Fun active work environment,with daily new task and challenges, it involves good communication skills and being able to work well with others."
bad,Terrible hours and pay. Very stressful commission based job. without the benefits of commission. wouldn't recommend.
bad,"Fun place to work but that it the only positive thing to say"
bad,"terrible job everybody thinks they are your boss and have no respect for their employees, theres no joy in this job, you bust bust your hump and are never rewarded."
bad,"My work schedule is varied. I usually work morning shifts, but I do occasionally get a evening shift.  The hours are flexible, to allow for family time.  When I log in for work, I immediately start taking connects from clients. I answer questions and if they need advanced support, I dispatch the client to a repair agent for further assistance.  "
bad,Stood at a register all day. I didn't learn anything new. Management was decent. Coworkers helpful. I didnt like how much time i had to just do nothing.
bad,crappyy management but not the worst place i have ever worked. over 100 employees in one building though typically all 18-25 in age. your asking for alot of drama. felt like i was in HS again
bad,"I hated working here, managers were atrocious and pay was awful. No benefits, no one cared about what you did. You got treated like commission without the perks of being commission."
bad,The Company at one time.. was amazing and cared about it's employees and this translated to it's customers.  Now you can just call them Walmart electronics.  On the store level it is riddled with bias favoritism and is prime for a class action harassment lawsuit on most levels and depts.  HR does not help it's employees when serious issues are sent in and turn a blind eye to numerous complaints from customers and staff combined.  They are digging out of a hole by cutting cost on pay compensation and management size per store.  Which is helping the companies bottom line. But at the cost to the employees and are rapidly losing all of their strong staff which made the company what its Branding implies.  BEST.
bad,"Retail is not fun just period, poor work life balance. Felt like upper management had no idea what retail was or how it actually worked, set unrealistic expectations and pressed managers hard. Large amount of turnover."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Only was there for Black Friday, then Laid off. The pay was ok. Management was strict. Coworkers were not helpful in teaching me the ropes, or got mad when I asked questions. The hardest part of the job was the lack of knowledge in a short time frame they wanted. There was nothing enjoyable about the company. Its a better place to shop then to work"
bad,"I started with the company as a regular part time employee. I had to relocate to a different state. The new Best Buy I transferred to opened up a position for me that did NOT say seasonal. They let me go trying to tell me that the job I applied for when they posted it for me during my relocation was seasonal. It wasn't. They just didn't want to keep me around because of my availability. So they smoothly let me go. The management is awful. Especially the one in Orlando, FL on East Colonial Drive. Store 517. Discount isn't worth the things you have to put up with. Management likes to barge in on your lunches and complain about the time you got off that was already approved. Not worth 10.00 an hour. I'd rather be a janitor."
bad,"In college this was an ok job to help out with living expenses, but this is not a career."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The pay is way to low for what Best Buy expects out of you. They fill your time will silly pointless paperwork. Unless you are a favorite plan to work every weekend, holiday and most nights. Also plan to be on call when you are off. They like to add hours to the schedule then not tell you."
bad,the hardest part of working for best buy is not the work it was more the employees and the managers.
bad,"Management was awful and played favorites"
bad,They will drain you completely. Best buy does not care about their employees after working there for 3 years and stepping up into a leaders role after not having a manager for 7 months they want to squeeze every single last bit of energy that you have.
bad,"I felt as though this company did not care about me as an employee. They barely trained me and then put me on the floor in the theater department for sales. I did well, but it was frustrating. Also, due to being a seasonal/temporary worker, it seemed that I was left to learn a lot about things on my own. Although I was the leading sales person in the few months I worked for Best Buy, I was not offered the full-time position at the end of the holiday season. It didn't seem to make sense."
bad,its not easy its hard and time consuming. not alot of free time
bad,"Low pay "
bad,terrible place to work. terrible management. terrible pay.
bad,Used to love working for the company. Where you're at in the store and what store you're in can greatly affect how much you enjoy your time with the company. I personally feel no pride or sense of self worth and am embarrassed to tell people I work there. Politics run wild with no mitigation or control of them and employees absorb it all and are seen purely as workers and not people. Avoid at all costs.
bad,"A typical day would be opening up your area, making sure its clean and ready for a customer experience.. but then you are doing every other departments work as well because apparently seniority is more valuable than actually working in the managers eyes. The scheduling is terrible most days not having the right amount of coverage for weekends making customers furious about the wait time. The only enjoyable part about the job is helping out people who truly need help in understanding products or computer functions. Best Buy is no longer about the customer, only about revenue."
bad,"The managers do not execute their jobs well.  I pick up their slack, as well perform my duties upon my shift.  Some co-workers however, slack up yet they do not get reprimanded or punished for their laziness.  Yet I am being watched more so than others."
bad,"Coach and develop employees to hit company as well as personal targets and goals. While having fun while being the best. "
bad,"Most days were filled with empty promises and stressed-out customers.  Management's direction was to meet sales goals not ensure ""having fun while being the best"" was met."
bad,No possibility for job advancement since the last restructure unless you know someone from corporate level. Company seems to be losing focus on customers and more on revenue coming in. Corrupt leadership taking advantage of overrides and making profits for themselves through re-sellers.
bad,"I once enjoyed my working environment however once the new CEO took the reigns, it all went downhill.  Too much pressure to make metrics and much, much less emphasis on the ""human"" experience."
bad,"I refuse to needlessly bash any company just for kicks because your experience could be different I'm simply trying to give some insight regarding my personal experience. Well with that said I would not recommend working for this company. My co-workers were very sluggish, unorganized and not well trained in any area of the department which confused me since most of them had at least 1-2 years of experience at that location. On several occasions I would witness co-workers simply walk past pallets that needed to be worked only to find them usually 8 of 10 people in the ware house texting or riding pallet jacks out of the truck. As for management I would consider their leadership skills, and overall capabilities Entry Level at best. I believe it only took 3 days of working there before I was answering questions for them...Well with all that said they are very diverse so I don't believe Race, Gender Etc will ever affect your chances of employment. Some locations are probably different so don't shy away from what may be a great career for you but my experience wasn't that best. Good Luck."

good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Horrible management. A few managers were unfair. Your job title doesn't matter, they'll put you in a different position and won't give you a raise for it. They change the schedule without you knowing."
bad,"As a customer service specialist I dealt with the ""headaches"".  From returns of unwanted items, to repairs on damaged items.  A day did not got by at this job without there being an outburst from a customer.  Although some were justified, others were unnecessary.  The managers in the store were unfortunately no help.  It was as if they would hide or run when their employees needed them.  The managers were involved in the gossip between their workers but no where to found when they were needed for a situation for a customer."
bad,"working at BBY is awful. the pay is insulting, they don't take into account availability changes, the men are pigs, they disrespect everyone (including customers), and they will not do anything to make things better or easier for their employees."
bad,"Management was terrible. Would not accept doctor's notes, would cut your hours to nearly nothing, etc."
bad,learned how to remove alarms as well as install them on high priced products.
bad,I was with best buy for 14 years as a supervisor started out great when it's was a company and not a slave ship if u have an oppion keep it to your self if not u will be terminated it's a political company if u don't brown nose u get nowhere it's a good ole boy company in augusta I'm ashamed to say I helped hire and fire employees over policies that don't exist until your not liked or have a backbone to say NO that's unethical
bad,The management was the only thing I did not like about this job. Everything else was pretty cool
bad,I missed two days in a year and they fired me. I missed them because they changed my schedule without telling me and no one from management stood up for me. they just turned their backs on me and fed me to the wolfs. It was horrible pay for the back breaking work you do.
bad,was not a great environment there was a ton of pressure from management to perform and no platform to succeed.
bad,"The environment wasn't the friendliest. I wish I enjoyed working there more, would of been a great career advancement. The scheduling was always so ""hectic""."
bad,The bestbuy treat you like pigs and the managers just want you to work and work they never have fun .
bad,Company has a hands off approach to Theft.  They rather have the Employees play Door Greeters then actually be proactive on stopping shrink issues.
bad,"I've stuck my neck, family time and dedication to get the project done and I get flacked for running over time."
bad,"Managed two different stores in two different states. Enjoyed the customers , but not the company . led both stores to number 1 in the district and further to the country. but the company doesn't want customer service or to help there clients."
bad,"Terrible place to work, hours are awful and you never make enough money. No matter how much money you make for them its never enough"
bad,not good place to work at treat you with no respect and not equal
bad,"Working at BestBuy was abysmal. They had horrible, unethical practices, constantly lying to customers and employees. After being harassed by a manager because I called out after I got into a car-accident, I quit. I will never shop at BestBuy again."
bad,do not apply unless you want to feel like you are in high school again.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,A typical day at work would be a fun day because you help people and also help your coworkers and you build a relationship with the customers and your coworkers.
bad,"The customer comes first mentality is very present in daily work. Aside from repairing computers helping customers with issues and providing support and solutions for their problems is top priority. Solutions range from backing up data for migrations, setting up new PCs, removing viruses or malware infections and physical repairs. Duties include but not limited to: helping customers at desk, checking in units in system, shipping, receiving, data migrations, virus removals, setup and configuration of new PCs, sales, technical support and tutorials. Lack of coverage in shifts leads to a lot of missed breaks, staying late and extra stress. When I first started co-workers were all friendly and shared interests and coverage existed. Team spirit was high and work seemed to rarely build up. Things took a turn for the worse when management refused to hire replacements for team members who left the company. The lack of coverage drove half the department to quitting, leaving 3 part timers 2 of which could only work weekends as the only staff. When management finally got a transfer to the store they also hired a few new workers who seemed to lack the technical knowledge required for the position. Shortly after coverage was reestablished the 3 workers quit leaving very little coverage yet again. Within a few Months on transferring the new supervisor also quit which led to yet another new transfer. The short staffing leads to endless interruptions missed lunches and unneeded stress caused by a buildup of work, the only good feeling is knowing that customers are being helped and leaving happy."
bad,Don't apply to the Kelowna store if you want a job you will enjoy. It'll seem great the first little while but longer your there worse it gets. You realize how poorly it is run and that the management team has no idea what their doing.
bad,"I have worked with Best Buy for three years under three different managers. Each new store manager had no etiquette in terms of introducing themselves, learning who I was or making me feel part of the team. The in-house training was a matter of get it done before the deadline rather than what did you learn. Overall, each manager was very unprofessional and lacked the social skilll set needed to work with young people. The majority of the blue shirts hate working for Best Buy and they're not shy about telling you. It's a disfunctional environment and the culture is out of date and crude by today's standards. The managers need to act like professionals instead of players out for a paycheck."
bad,"But really, I have had such immense amount of contact with a regional supervisor in my life. We were required to check in several times per day to update them on our sales progress for the day. Not conducive to the pay scale."
bad,It was an alright first job for a high schooler. Employee discount was only positive. People in my department were easy to get a long with.
bad,"We're pressured to sell protection plans 100% of the time.  It becomes more about us than the customer - we don't care about helping the customer, we care about swindling them out of their money."
bad,0 chances for advancement unless you are in the good ole boy club. They have already picked who they are going to promote reguardless of their numbers on the line.
bad,"Best Buy is a terrible company, when I was there everyone hated to be at work so much they voted for the Rumba as employee of the month. Pay sucks, they were misleading about pay, benefits, and positions. No one makes commision but the train you and drive you to sell like you do, constantly gabbing in your headset about sales, numbers, up selling, attaching and warranties. "
bad,"absolutley to much headache for such little pay, to to to much headache."
bad,"this company is a joke, they dont pay well they have no respect for their employees, they work you like a slave, but expect u to perform with minium wage pay, they expect you to come running when ever they need you , dont show u any appreciation , there are some good customers that come through from time to time, put the employees are not knowlegeable of the products so there and the supervisors and managers a LAZY!!!!"
bad,WORST company to work for. They dont promote you and too many favoritism.
bad,"Good seasonal Seasonal Job to get by. Co-workers were fun, but no real benefits from this job"
bad,"In the beginning it was a great job , but after being there for so ling U began to find out the truth. The management is beyond poor, they do not provide you with the proper tools to do your job nor do they provide you with appropriate hours. You cannot support yourself, let alone a family with only 6 -12 hours a week when you were guaranteed no less than 22 a week while part time."
bad,"Can't recommend Best Buy to anyone.  The workload is ridiculously laborious and quasi-slavery.  Most idiotic, dimwitted managers who only know one word: QUOTA.  "
bad,"customer oriented"
bad,"never again,"
bad,didnt care how the company was ran or about employees just wanted to get work done.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"ok company, worked part time here, job was fun and coworkers were very helpful"
bad,Part time for 6.5 years. No advancement to full time. Sexist community in warehouse
bad,I can't say enough bad things about Best Buy. The staff is micromanaged to death by the managers. The management constantly finds flaws in even the best sales people. They have effectively driven away all of their talent.
bad,"really didnt care to much for this company, the managrs were rude and the breaks was was very short to be standing on your feet for long periods of time"
bad,the hardest part about this job is the hours and the fact that you have to work on holidays.
bad,"As a product tester it was okay, but not a lasting job."
bad,"Bad leadersip,low salary,poor values,bad management,bad work,life balance.too much paperwork for simple tasks."
bad,"-Part-time hours are never the same, and the amount of hours change weekly (hope you live at home)."
bad,Worst work experience ever. Company is unorganized and we dont work off commission but the way you are forced to hit numbers that cannot be reached is ridiculous.
bad,As my mother always taught me to do in certain situations...
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. Corporate cut most of the benifits (employee discount), and were heavy on forcing credit cards and useless attatches. Managers ended up stressed, and pushed it onto the floor folk. Not a good end."
bad,The managers of this store are high school drop outs at best. They don't understand how educated people work and operate. Everybody complains about how unfair employees are treated here. Not a great place to work.
bad,Non commisioned sales job. Compensation dependent on department performance. Poor performance from team members resulted in less pay.
bad,Managers do not like to work. They sit around in groups talking to each other texting on their phones. Very quick to point the finger at someone else when something goes wrong. Poor work ethic
bad,"I've never worked at a place that had such little respect for their employees. The management was totally out of touch and just about the only time they showed up was to criticize or ask you to stay longer. Not only will I never work there again, but I'll never shop their either."
bad,Very bad place to work. Managers are constantly changing rules and regulations on a daily basis without telling employees and employees get written up for not following rules that they don't knowabout. Breaks are almost non existing in this place. Not enough hours to survive in but they can keep hiring people while someone who has been there for years only gets 17 hrs a week. Not a healthy work environment
bad,"loved the company when i worked for them in FL, but hated the company working for them in MIchigan."
bad,Companies can be great and management can leave a lot to be desired. It's very tough to love a company you worked for when you watch managers mess it up and I know this isn't true in every location. It was just my opinion in mine.
bad,Im not going to say much about this company other than their moral and ethical values suck!
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"This company throws away it's general managers at least once a year in all it's locations, no job security there."
bad,this was a part time job while i was in high school. it was fun and i enjoy the time i was there. i dont recall much of it.
bad,This job was terrible. I got written up my first day for not wearing a belt that matched my shoes!! no joke.
bad,Job is stressful and I felt like I was a robot working for a battery. The discounts are goodand the co-workers was ok bt the management did not do a very good job at maintaining a good work environment.
bad,"They started with a great compensation and slowly took it away. When i left they didn't care about your pay and with the company going bankrupt they cannot afford anything. The job wasn't hard but they do not train anymore. I was trained a week and when i left you got two days to know all the carriers and you were left to figure it out. Management is like a revolving door and they go by high school rules. If you care not in the in crowed then you are on their war path. Be safe, watch your back, keep your head down."
bad,"This is one of the most terrible places I have ever worked. The employees do not know anything about computers or repairs. Whenever customers bring in a computer to be repaired, the ""Agents"" take the computers to back and hook them up to the internet so a remote person can do the work. They would rather have a sales person over someone with technical knowledge. There prices are too high and the customers are severely ripped off. I have worked there for two years and I am disgusted at how they operate. Also any repairs other than a hard-drive replacement or memory installs have to be shipped to Kentucky; That alone takes 2 to 4 weeks that the customer has to go without a computer. I would always advise a customer to take the unit to someone who is professional like a local computer repair shop and not to a bunch of geek squad kids."
bad,I had never worked in a franchise chain before and was glad that it only lasted for eight months. In retail the hours worked are insane and your life revolves around their schedule. Dealing with the general public and the rudeness that comes along with it is unbearable.
bad,Working in retail is the same across the board. Most jobs are the same. Best Buy is no different.
bad,"Took a ""seasonal"" job at the local big box as I was unemployed at the time. Nothing good to say about it. Store sales manager once told me to substitute an non-sale item since we were sold out of the real sale item. Then he came back in an hour and denied it - after I had sold several of the substitute items. Guess who was ""proven"" to be a liar - yep, yours truly. Hardest work and most thankless job I've ever had."
bad,"I love meeting new people and working with the public and coworkers. I am a team player and always strive ti do my best and handle myself in a proffisional mannor,"
bad,"i learned alot dealing with electronics and houseware, also i learned how to work on a fast pace"
bad,"Best Buy really suffers from bad management, and they live quarter to quarter which is a really bad strategy. Their employees do not receive proper training, nor are they compensated adequately. This company has strict selling quotes and train their employees to pressure you in to warranties - which are junk. Also, the services Geek Squad offers, specifically making your recovery DVDs is something ANYONE can do on their own - and Best Buy charges 99.99. So ask yourself, would you pay 100 dollars for 3 blank DVD's and saving an hour of your time?"
bad,"Not a good place to work, they try to get people to spend more money then needed ,they took advantage of unknowing customers, the people I worked with in geek squad were racist."
bad,District staff didnt like my management style and didnt like me turning in managers who didnt do the right thing. Once they dont like you then you are finished. They will find a way to get rid of you.
bad,sales just wasnt for me. There way of selling I felt was to be very pushy on the customer
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Only the favorites get promoted. Too much sucking up. You get written up for stupid stuff, for example, not carrying your clipboard."
bad,"This is a company I worked for in various positions for 4.5 years. In that time I have seen the company quickly decline from a great place to work, to someplace I couldn't wait to get away from. Once upon a time Best Buy's plan to stay open while Amazon took more and more of their market share was to focus on employees. By having happy and trained employees who CARED about the customers they felt they would remain in business, but as of late the focus has shifted away from 'doing whats best for the customer' to 'sell them everything possible and force them into opening up an in-store credit card'."
bad,"They are slowly taking away all of the benefits and/or watering them down... When you first get hired they talk big on having a fun work place where they want your personalty to shine through to the customers and to ""make friends"" with them... Then they jump down your throat if you do not get ever single attachment they offer on the products you sold. The only way to advance in this place it hang out with the management outside of work, as they would rather advance their friends than give a better job the the more qualified and harder working person. Management are a joke and only care about the numbers (I understand its a business) and they will find ways to get rid of you if you don't drink their kool-aid. This place does not care about your life outside work, and will let you go if you can not meet the hours they want you to work. I am a single father and there were times I just could not work and they would cut my hours as a punishment."
bad,"As a cashier I was pushed to ""sell"" things. In the sales department I didn't. Mangement wasn't constistent in being available."
bad,"Part-time means OnCall every single day. Rude management and front end lead is offensive. I would never return to retail because of this company, and the pay is aweful."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"On paper, Best Buy should be a great employer, in practice is quite the opposite. There are a slew of managers that will get you fired for personal, and often, petty reasons. Clear instances of preferential treatment and at times blatantly sexist. Ignorant and abusive managers are allowed to keep their jobs for unhealthy amounts of time. Avoid at all cost unless you're a master at manipulation."
bad,"I worked as AP basically full time on a part time schedule. I got 30+ hours a week in and didn’t get any benefits. "
bad,"I worked in the geek squad, where there was a serious diversity inequality.  There was never enough staff for the repair side, constantly beaked at over the radio to fulfill customer service requests, yet no time to actually do the repairs. Christmas time was heartless, the store was make upwards of +$160,000 yet there was no money for hours to do the work properly and as soon as christmas was over, there was no money for enough hours to pay rent and eat."
bad,I would give the management 0 stars as they are incapable of running a store. They are children that grew up into older children. Higher up management don't care about anything.
bad,Toxicity oozes from this store. I could rant for hours on the amount of things management does that's hypocritical or against the Ontario labor board but I'll save us the time. If you do choose to work for any best buy and you work overtime I highly recommend that you make sure you get paid for it. More than one time myself or a coworker had hours mysteriously disappear from one week to only appear the next to avoid the 1.5x pay out. Happens a lot since the Managers do love their bonuses.
bad,"To sum it up theirs no commission on any sale regardless if it’s a 1000 package or 10,000. And they pay you near minimum and require you to do much more then your job description"
bad,"Ive been with Best Buy just about 2 years, in the 2 years that i have been there i have witnessed so many Re-organizations. From positions being cut to store sales structure changing. It makes it hard to feel like your in a stable work environment. On top of that the sales associates are told to ask “Discovery” questions; So many... to the point where i anger customers. They want us to sell like were commission based."
bad,I worked AP( Asset Protection)  for eight months. It's not a bad job but it also isn't a good job. You greet each and every customer that enters the store. You have to actively pay attention to potential shoplifters. People sometimes would speak. You CAN NOT apprehend anyone nor can you get in the way of a shoplifter or you'll lose your job. The job can get VERY boring as the managers DO NOT want anyone to speak to you. If they are behind on BP'S (branded payments) management will ask you to ask people to sign up for Best Buy credit cards. Very stressful job and the pay is HORRIBLE for what you do.
bad,Do not apply. Management needs to be retrained or replaced. Overtime opportunity is limitless but the trade off is your work life balance. Turn over is at a record high. Applicants beware
bad,"Management promotes who they want, when they want.  And that's it.  If you don't drink the kool aid....you don't get promoted.  Used to be a good bonus structure, but then they took that away."
bad,I worked in customer service and would not recommend this job to anyone. Coworkers were very rude to me and not helpful as being a new person. They would make comments about me under their breath but loud enough I could hear. If I needed help they would talk trash instead of helping me. Only there a few weeks. I could understand if I had been there for months.
bad,"The best part of it is the discount. "
bad,My experience at Best Buy was unique I was a delivery experienced agent did appliance delivery it was very physical and dangerous in the end I had to decide to make a change
bad,The best part of the job was the great discount and fellow crew members. Management is so inconsistent and their lack of communication was extremely frustrating. I also received retaliation from my direct manager when I called her out on a lie. She smiled to my face with the lie so I went above her head to thee GM who confirmed the lie. She then tried to claim that she fought for the correct rate for me and not the incorrect pay rate she put down on paper. She treated me horribly that other employees brought it to my attention.
bad,I worked at best buy a little over a year. Typical day you focus on hitting your quota for the day. Everything I learned was from training  videos which wasn't much because I knew most of the tech from  hands on experience. The workplace culture was very negative a lot of unhappy employees because everyone is stressing over they're numbers.
bad,Company doesn't practice diversity and inclusion. Women move up faster than anyone. All about young women moving up. And yes racism does exist here so be aware. Management hate when white and black hang out especially a white woman flirting with a black man.
bad,"I have not worked there in over a decade, but when I did we were pushed to make as large a sale as possible. We were directed to lie to customers about what they needed in order to pump up sales numbers."
bad,"Stressful with unrealistic expectations and goals. Promotions are based on ""favoritism"" or selling out for the company. Knowledge and experience does not matter and counts for almost nothing."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Managers excel at corporate double speak. They stifle conversations about pay. Asset Protection is a joke. There is no room for advancement. The employees I work with are extremely sensitive, and I've been written up a few times because I am blunt, and I don't mince words. That doesn't mean I try to offend people, but it is what it is. "
bad,Management could never get their ideas accomplished. The GM was a disgrace of a person to be in management. The understanding of what needed to be accomplished and by who was non existent.
bad,"The best salespeople are promoted to management, which means that sales skills qualify for management (which does not use relevant skills)."
bad,"Best buy, want to seem friendly, however the culture is toxic. Management is openly hostile to most employees and is not held to any fair work practices by themselves or others"
bad,Management is horrible. There is only y one manager who even seems to care and even he is not always the best manager. The managers are rude and usually start in-fighting among the employees. There are quite a few employees who talk about other employees negatively and then act as if their innocent. Management uses scheduling to try to force employees to quit or to be able to fire them. The information given to employees tends to be conflicting information most times. Although employees may learn different areas in the store they are not usually compensated with a raise for learning how to be a better employee in many different positions. There is only 1 opportunity every year to get a raise and most times a lot of people are denied their raises despite the fact that they have learned and stayed with the company. Most of the employees are unhappy with management and states very often that the way management treats them and talks to them makes them unhappy. Management even pretends to do more for their managers' sake whenever they come in. Most people are trained to do certain things in the store and when they actually have to report the work they have completed they tend to have to do so under a managers name instead of having their own information. There is nothing that I have found to be great about this job other than getting along with a few employees. The pay is not great and the hours aren't always the best but when there aren't many jobs around most of us are forced to stay and put up with the horrible atmosphere that we work in everyday.
bad,The time that I spent at Best Buy wasn’t too great. There’s this culture where you have to “fit in” to be taken seriously. Hard work doesn’t pay off here. Great for someone that needs quick cash.
bad,I just wouldnt recommend Best Buy as one of my first choices to work. But what works for me may work for someone else. Just didnt meet me with the opportunities I was seeking to advance in my career.
bad,"Don't work here, you wont get any hours, no competitive pay, they pay you $1 above minimum wage, favoritism, all the managers worry about the dumbest things, not a god work environment."
bad,"Not a place to  put your time and energy into , Positions are given to those that are favored not those who put in the time and energy and actually care about the job instead of just a paycheck.When you do alert corporate on favoritism, Retaliation has been know and has  happen. Management, Some would say what Management. There is no leadership. I'm not saying all  Best Buys are bad, but dont waist your time with this one."
bad,"I was applying to other positions WITHIN the company but the Store Manager pulled me into the office and asked me ""What makes you think you are good enough for any of these positions?"" Outraged I went to corporate HR and they didn't do anything aside from punish me! My Hours went from 32+ a week to -12 a week after that."
bad,Best Buy Park Royal Mall manager's employing their own freinds and family members and let them grow and keep them in the company. They just hire other people as an seasonal associate and give them entery roles like greating role and then after season fire them. West vancouver Best Buy have horrible and onfair managments for this reason. Probebly family & freinds of employee have hire wages too.
bad,"Overall working at Best Buy was pretty boring there was no real chance for advancement. Worked there part time for years waiting to get a full time position that never appeared, all the while getting negligible pay raises."
bad,"Would never be a career. Decent work life balance, but no pay. No benefits. Big box corporation with no care for its employees. I would not ever consider going back to this company."
bad,GM hired his friends that don't have any retail experience and turned the store into a laughing stock. Literally just hired his friend that worked in a warehouse and neither of them can run a store.
bad,"Worked at bestbuy sales before moving to Geek Squad, had pretty good experience there but working at geek squad wasn't such a great experience for me. Definitely don't recommend working there, but the discounts was okay."
bad,"the store is all politics. it doesn't matter if you're good at your job or if you're qualified to lead a department, if they don't like you, you'll never be promoted."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Best Buy is a bad company to work for, they treat their employees terribly. They try to make it seem like there is a great culture but the truth is its all about the money."
bad,"I was hired on as a temp workers during the holiday season.  The only requested hours I asked to not work were Sunday mornings.  Every week I was scheduled during Sunday mornings and had to talk to my supervisor about correcting it.  If you work during the holiday hours, say good bye to actually celebrating any holiday.  Also, I was never told by an actual supervisor when my last day was scheduled.  I read about it on a billboard in the break room."
bad,"Nada recomendable, empezando por la contratacion, te piden tantas referencias como si sus ofertas laborales fueran muy ""BUENAS"", con razon casi nadie dura mucho tiempo con ellos."
bad,Best thing about GSC was the understanding of your day-to-day responsibilities. 
bad,"If you love to punch a clock- this is your spot. Compensation under 30k, horrible hours, and micro-managing.  30 min lunch breaks and only tenured advancement."
bad,Great people that teach a lot about leadership and goals. This is not a long term career but it is a foot in the door if management is what you want to strive for.
bad,"In the era of dying 'Big Box Stores', Best Buy has shifted the worst onto it's customers and it's employees. Management boils everything down to product numbers and upselling much to the chagrin of the customer whose needs are not met and the employee who feels guilty about selling product at a marked up price to a customer who does not need an item."
bad,"This company has many issues.  It is all about the money.  Not about it's employees. If for any reason you get hurt on the job, these is no place to work after the rehabilitation.  Instead, you are required to do the same work as before the injury even if there is lifting restrictions put in play by the doctor."
bad,"The culture and work hours have become worse and less.  Management picks favorites and the rest are left with the scraps."
bad,Favoritism favoritism is the main thing of this store .. if you're not one of the favorites they won't promote you and they'll always find reasons to write you up ... nothing is consistent and it's always unpredictable.. this is only good for a temporary job ..
bad,"If you want a job where the managers are constantly looking over your shoulder and making suggestions that come from having no experience in the field at all, you are in for a good time at Best Buy's Geek Squad."
bad,"I worked as an inventory specialist at best buy in Delafield, Wisconsin. It started out ok, but after awhile had numerous problems with employees and managers alike. I was very disappointed and hurt. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,Worked for the company for 5 years and the leadership is in complete disarray.  Gm can't have an original opinion steals from his employees and passes off as his own to take credit.
bad,The supervisors were great but upper management was difficult to work for. Upper management went over my head a lot for things I was perfectly capable of  taking care of independently.
bad,Poor management.  They have the good ole boys club and if not in there they blackball you.  I would not recommend this company.  Many co-workers have left in past year.
bad,Expected to much from some people who would not know about electronics at all. Focused too much in clients comments when they weren't about us. They would allow over time as much as needed.
bad,"The one advantage Bestbuy has over its competition is the idea that the Blueshirts are experts and they can give you professional expert advice about the products you are looking to purchase. The problem is there is no incentive for the sales reps to learn about the products and actually become experts. Sure, you get a pin for each level. If a $0.05/hour raise would accompany them that would mean something. Even a $0.03/hour raise would make a difference. The expectations are ridiculous and the metrics are worse than that. The pay is also on par with the fastfood and grocery store pay with much more stress."
bad,"This is not the hate fueled rantings of a scorned former employee. Best Buy fosters an environment of commission without actually giving commission. If you care about your career and give it your all, you will get all sorts of responsibilities, just no more pay. If you've been there for years and barely do your job, you'll rise in the ranks. The Saratoga Springs NY Best Buy is nearly unworkable. They are so understaffed right now for a reason. It is a greedy corporation that cares only for their money, you are just a number. And despite all these negative things the worst are the managers. To the point I wouldn't have given a star at all if it were possible. I'm not happy with a lot of this job, but most of it -is- pretty standard for an entry level retail job. The managers are the truest definition of leeches, sucking at the under belly of the world. They care only about themselves, and they got to where they are by being backstabbing filth. In my experience they are the type that would fire 50 people if it got them a promotion. Now, not all of them are like this. While I was there the manager for the warehouse/front lanes/etc, was one of the best managers I worked for. However, Mr. Lindemann, the sales manger is easily the worst. Who not only forced me out after putting my two weeks in, (within two days of putting in notice) is easily the single reason for half of the people leaving while I worked there and after I left. If there is a silver lining for working for this company, it's the coworkers you have. *Most* of the regular employees there are really chill. If you're looking"
bad,"Have a terrible turn over rate, defintely a good place to work at for a while as long as u have a back up plan, make money and move on, management is very unprofessional. Ask anyone that has worked for them, they treat u good as a rep if u sell, but after u become management they treat you terribly"
bad,"The work itself isn't difficult for anyone who is truly enthusiastic about technology. That being said, every location I've worked with has had poor management, poor human resource assistance, and just decent compensation. I've seen people get terminated for personal issues with management and I've seen management get away with truly slimy things. All in all it got me to where I am but I wouldn't do it again if they doubled my pay."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Not only was the hours ridiculous i was not getting paid nearly enough for my service, not to mention it is remotely impossible to move up no matter how much of a good worker you are, unless you are best friends with upper management."
bad,"I loved working at best buy but i did not like when they changed to a contractor had nothing but problems,have nothing more to say it was always stressful"
bad,A typical day at work here consists of managers not taking responsibility for they're actions and spending the work day smoking cigarettes on nonstop breaks. Only to come off of an abused break time to yell at a lower ranked employee to do managerial work on a part time employee salary.
bad,Best Buy upper management overlooked my skills and abilities to lead. Management based decisions on friendships not professional skills.
bad,"Implement and enforce departmental policies and procedures. Provide comprehensive knowledge of all products, financing options, and services within the store. Assist the store with daily, monthly and annual budget goals by driving financing options and service plans. Assist the Media Supervisor with the product placement to maximize sales revenue. Provide personalized lessons in audio recording, guitar, and bass. Oversaw inventory for the entire musical instrument department. Trained all employees within department including all Supervisors"
bad,High middle management burn out rate.  Leadership is very rigid and accountability falls on middle management with no accountability for those that are responsible.  Terrible place for people with a family.
bad,"Don't really care about employees; only about making a profit."
bad,"Not culture oriented, poor management, over worked and under payed, very unsafe driving conditions do to the company providing a ""rear wheel drive"" delivery truck in Montana. What's interesting is I knew a driver from Arizona that had a 4 wheel drive delivery truck. How does that make sense. No compensation or even a simple hand shake for a Job well done. 5 years of my life I'll never get back."
bad,"Long hours, too many managers and through-the-roof prices on everything in the store. A miserable, mercifully short-lived, experience."
bad,"There are a number of glaring flaws at the Amarillo Best Buy, the main one being that performance is not rewarded, but being liked by management is.  This favoritism leads to people who don't work to do their job being promoted, while those who work hardest don't get promoted."
bad,"After 6 months of not being late, passed over for advancements, and general lack of motivation on the part of management to correct mistakes I left this job. I would say that if you can deal with the emotional roller coaster that the Managers like to put you through this might be the place for you. However as a grown adult looking for a full time position this is a less than best choice. Being talked to like you're an adolescent with no skills and publicly berated based on a preconceived notion is the reason why I left."
bad,"First you go through a ton of training... i mean a ton like 3 weeks worth. then you shadow people to train some more. never in that whole time touching a register or dealing with customers. second after they ""train"" you its off you go with no one around that wants to answer anything helpful. then the pay is the worst. i made more working for Walmart and at a gas station."
bad,"Low pay, terrible benefits and everyone is always in a bad mood. Leadership doesn't care about their employees in the least bit"
bad,"former employee here! let me share my experience working for best buy to give some insight :)"
bad,"Everything started out great when I started working at Best Buy, but as I continued to advance I began to see how the company really operates. They don't care the slightest about their employees and blatant favoritism goes on on a daily basis. The schedules are set up so that you have almost no time for life outside of work and they try to breed a culture where all you think and do is Best Buy. The pay for the amount of work was also not good. They won't hesitate to fire an employee who has been nothing, but loyal for simple infractions. Overall I would say stay far away from Best Buy if you can it's great for a part-time or temporary job but as a career its not worth it I was able to see why they're going out of business and got out ASAP."
bad,The one I worked at had a very low employee retention rate. People were quitting on a weekly basis mainly due to management. That place is a sinking ship.
bad,"A typical day at work requires an associate to down stock items form a shelves 10 feet above the ground, using an unstable stairs that are on wheels. The management are always too preoccupied with other matters to even bother to notice you there."
bad,"Responsible for over 30+ transactions related to cash, credit or check in a day. I learned how to ignore critisim and favoratism. Learned how to be ready to work if needed and work efficiently with all of my co-workers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Helping customers with product selections
bad,"The number of units they expect, and push for, to be repaired / inspected is too high and too unrealistic."
bad,Bet Buy was an ok place to work but they expect you to shape your life around it and to be fake towards customers. They want the workers to be robots instead of selling naturally.
bad,Best Buy Geek Squad is a very easy job that can be done with minimal IT training. The downside is there are no advancements or pay raises. There is also very little job satisfaction.
bad,"This was the worst job I’ve ever held. I was told there would be opportunities to move to customer service and sales, but quickly realized that was false, and a lie to get me to work and stay there."
bad,"There are better jobs. I promise. Especially when it comes to advancing, they are shiesty with that sort of behavior. You can find a sales job that valued you more and gives you better pay."
bad,"It was a good “first job” type of job. Good people. I worked here over 6 years ago and at a job like that turnover isn’t extremely high, but only a few people make a career out of it. The management when I was there gave me a bunch of good experience in this type of industry, but I doubt they are still there."
bad,"Honestly, it wasn't really a great experience working at Best Buy. If you went to a township school, you'll enjoy it. There is little to no training or downtime. You get a flexible schedule and plenty of benefits such as waterproof enabled wages. The worst part is integrating into the culture of the company. It is kind of young but everyone is kind of fat and arrogant."
bad,"In my experience, I would describe working at Geek Squad as an abusive, highly dysfunctional professional work environment (or an alcoholic parent metaphor). Meaning, you only know when you've done something wrong never the other way around... Contrary to what they say, this is not an all inclusive work environment and I would not recommend working here, unless, you're into it."
bad,I believe the way best buy store #829 was run unprofessional and disorganized. They don’t work with your availability and their customer service is very poor.
bad,"They won't call you in for your first day of work. Overall, they seemed like a nice company to work for at the time, until they never called me in to work for them."
bad,Terrible place to work harassment verbal and physical abuse is normal I made many reports to hr about it and nothing ever happened except retaliation.  If you are working you way through college not a bad place other then that don’t try to feed your family working there
bad,"A typical day at work would be spending the first hour waiting for a customer to come in. Being told to be busy while there is no customer in the building can be confusing as there is a limited amount of tasks to be done. When you have finished these tasks they continue to reprimand you for not doing enough. It's also possible to be reprimanded for not selling enough to a customer. For example, a $3000 dollar purchase can be considered ""bad"" if you did not also get them to buy one of the best buy services or a credit card. No explanation as to why it is important to do so just that it is your job and also, while there are no quotas, management strongly implies they would fire someone for not fulfilling them."
bad,"Poor management and highly bias......never a place for career growth. You can not even seek permission to write exam, they will fire you. WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER WORKED IN MY LIFE. RUN!"
bad,When I was hired I asked how many hours per week I could expect.  They told me 20-25.  The last straw was the week after black  Friday I was only given 8 hours for the entire week.  No one can live on that I was forced to find another job.
bad,"Had virtually no say into anything, felt very undervalued, ""picked on"" for not being exactly how they want you to be. Very mentally draining and I was also cornered into a position which eventually didn't exist anymore. Only reason I didn't quit sooner was the money. Inner circle management with HR on their side."
bad,they dont give you commission yet they expect you to sell as if youre making anything over 14 an hour. The management is toxic and its a lot of pressure on you for how much youre getting paid. Forget it dont work here
bad,"The company as a whole needs a lot of work. Women often get discriminated against and treated poorly. Co-workers aren't allowed to date but still do anyways which would always lead to conflict in the workplace. You were always pressured and yelled at to meet the hrly and end of the day store quota. If you were a favorite you could pretty much do whatever you wanted and got to pick your black friday schedule first while everyone got left overs. The gossip in the place was ridclouse, it was like you were back in highschool.  Besides the employee discount this was the only good thing about working at this place. And unless you sucked up to management good luck getting a decent raise. 10 cent raise a year is not worth the stress and drama of this place."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Rude managers and unrealistic sales goals. Backhanded comments from managers who don't work and always speak down to you. They had to start feeding their employees to keep morale up because so many kept quitting. Honestly it just plain sucks trying to sell expensive stuff to rich jerks while I can barely afford to eat myself.
bad,"Unless you want to be taken advantage of and used by your employers I would not recommend working at any Best Buy but more specifically store 840 located in Battle Creek MI. The management had me working full time hours but without allowing me to receive any of the full timer benefits as i was still classified as a part time employee (even though working full time hours). Management at store 840 has very obvious favoritism towards their leaders sometimes going as far as training employees in areas outside of their pay grade to go on personal vacations but not compensate the employee for the added position and role responsibilities. You will get constant belittling from the leaders if your credit card applications and geek squad protection attachment percentages are not up (even if you have been good the day or week before it doesn’t matter). Best Buy will try to pay you as little as possible while trying to get the most work out of you, unless you want just a seasonal job with decent employee discounts on insignia products (which i don’t recommend using) you would be better off going to a Menards or Lowes or maybe a circle k. also its note to mention i had to show the General Manager of store 840 how to do a basic return if that says anything for ya."
bad,"I was hired as a temporary worker. In the beginning, there was a very boring online training session, in which I did not really learn much since there is so much information that is hard to remember when they put on the sales floor. I was also pressured to sell additional services offered by the geek squad, but they don't really give you the tools to the need to do so. I did not get received feedbacks based on my performance once. So, it was frustrating. I was scheduled only a few hours a week, the only day I really worked a lot was during the holidays. In which, everyone worked over time, and you could tell coworkers were tired and burned out. I don't know, had higher expectations from best buy, but I guess this way as I was a temporary worker. Perhaps, it was a full-time employee thing were had been different."
bad,"I hated working for best buy once the new sales manager came into the store. He sucked the life out of all the employees and was very condescending to a majority of the employees.  "
bad,"I did not like the store I worked at. I quit as soon as I was able to."
bad,"Pretty sure Best Buy is operating illegally."
bad,"Pressure to sell services and warranties. No respect for employees. The only competency to be in the store management is if you can shove warranties in the mouth of customers. Grievance system is useless and management supports the management. No incentive for achieving the sales target. "
bad,"Working at best buy first seemed exciting and interesting, but as time went by, I came to realize that the company does not actually care about its employees at all. It is an environment of fear, there is no job security. All they care about are their unrealistic numbers and goals, for which they harass their employees if they do not meet."
bad,"Best Buy compensation and opportunities for advancement are simply out of touch with the needs of the employees.  The culture was almost fraternal in nature... where as some in management had a ""Frat Boy"" mentality of ""pledging"" new hires.  But this is just my experience at my particular location and I would never recommend this environment for anyone."
bad,The communication between supervisors and  their employess is very degrading. Most supervisors don't even care about their own job. Other employees tend to be egotistical and the relationship between sellers and product process is non existent and embarrassing a workplace has people divided in that way.
bad,"Wanna hate your life?  Become a salaried manager at Best Buy."
bad,"In general best buy is not an all bad place to work at but in my case and what point in time I was in my life it just did not work out well. There was no consistency in management, they lacked control and order of their own departments, always annoyed by not having a steady schedule, only knowing my schedule for the next two weeks, and was just not what I expected when i signed up for the jobs, Being a geek squad agent is all about being just another sales Person! The people in the work place were great though, unfortunately just not in the right place."
bad,"At first it was great the training was good although, 16 hours for a presentation (Saturday and Sunday) about how Best Buy became and not really being trained on the department you're assigned to, the managers from each department really takes time to make sure everyone is trained properly (you learn as you work), but with that the managers and current employee's start to take advantage of new employee's or seasonal's, as well managers try to withhold you from taking your break or won't let you take any breaks even thought its is against labor law."
bad,"You’d better be a great suck up or they’ll let you go! If you have your own opinion and if you think you should be treated fairly then don’t apply at Best Buy Distribution Center in Findlay, OH."
bad,"Started out as a fun job with good people. once new management took over and the company was reorg-ed there were hour cuts and layoffs.  Loved working to the very edge of having benefits and then having hours slashed to be kept as part-time. Towards the end of my time there, managers spent more time hiding in the ""hub"" than working with customers and it showed in the store and morale."
bad,"The computer repair job wasnt bad in and of itself. repairing laptops is actually an engaging and fun experience for this techie :D however, i am inexperienced at laptops, as my main expertise is desktop PCs outside of employment with geek squad, repair wise. the worst thing about the experience, was i received next to nothing in the ways ot training, and it was like they expected me to be an expert in one or two days.... they sent me to receiving and then laid me off.... I could repair the PCs had i received training. I think they just don't care enough to properly train their associates...."
bad,"It's been a long time since I worked there. From what I remember, the hours were terrible, the pay was terrible, there was almost no opportunity for advancement, and they fired me because I was going to school and they refused to work with my schedule even though I had worked there for over a year. Do not recommend Best Buy at all. Also monthly meetings at 7 AM on Sunday morning is enough to make you cry."
bad,"From day one it was a less than stellar experience. People with their own agendas in Procurement drove me nuts- and a promotion that was made was so clearly done out of friendship that it caused great dissatisfaction among the team and those that worked with it. Honestly couldn't wait to escape, felt like they sucked my soul dry."
bad,"I used to work there and the managers at BestBuy are extremely horrible. They say that BestBuy is a non-commisioned company but pressures your employees to sell and sell and sell. If you do not meet your weekly budget, you will be stuck with the managers and the managers will pressure you, even more, when you don't sell the geek squad warranty. Managers always mess up the hours and blame the employees for not reminding the managers. Last pay raise I got from BestBuy was 30cent. It is not worth to work there for what you get."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"They play favorites and expect you to do most of the work by yourself if you are not buddy buddy with management. Erratic schedules, and they expect you to work whenever they want including your days off. Taking time off is very difficult and rarely approved by management."
bad,Managers change all the time. Higher positions are almost hired from the outside. A lot of office politics and favoritism. Poor leadership from management
bad,"I found the managers to be very unsupportive. they didn't take into an account and couldn't work a 40 hr. week. I was made to feel guilty, and stressed on a daily shift. I was yelled at in front of customers and was told to do different jobs by different managers. I loved selling the product, meeting the customers, solving problems and my co-workers. I just couldn't get behind feeling abused by management, having little support or understanding as a 17 year old kid."
bad,Typical day at work was stressful for the amount of pay you receive.  Most customers are only in theatre to preview before ordering online.  Not all employees were held fairly accountable.
bad,"2 jobs with Best Buy, each experience disappointed me greatly. Contract employees are treated like garbage. The culture is uppity with an ego to the company. "
bad,Alright place to begin. First job.  It’s not a place to stay and you get no commission. But they want you to get them credit cards and get nothing for it and sell sell sell
bad,Great employee discount on products. Leadership is not very engaged and the company typically does not promote to salary positions within. Great job for someone young.
bad,"It was a great job at first, but it was very political ( alt right ) certain mangers would bring down others views & if you spoke against it, you’ll be fired later that day via cell phone. No joke. Also, all they do is hire and let go of temps at this warehouse. The pay is pretty low as well. You’ll be lucky if you stay around for 3 months."
bad,Management has no idea about what goes on in the install bay and they only care about numbers really pretty much everything that doesn't have anything to do with actually working on vehicles they will stress you out and ride your back over little things. Nothing like any other shop just a terrible experience.
bad,"If the manager doesn't like you they let it be known by constantly picking on you. The typical work day started at about 7 AM and ends when they want it to end. You start by making sure prices are up to date and completing the overnight orders that were placed online- all of which needs to be done before 8AM when more online orders come in. I never had an enjoyable experience because the whole time management was breathing down our necks about customers, carry outs, completing the online orders, taking out the trash and cleaning restrooms. They want all to be done within 5 minutes which is impossible. The pay and benefits were not worth the hassle."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working at this company. Everything you did revolved around numbers and the way things appeared. It was sales driven and no one really cared what the customer really wanted, let alone what they asked for. The manager I had did not like me and took every opportunity to make things uncomfortable for me and other co-workers."
bad,"If you are generally interested in working in tech this is the very worst place to start, but it is a place to start. You will learn nothing, be treated badly, and every single person you work with hates the whole world. "
bad,"On the outside it seems like a great place to work. The problem is there are no available hours to work in the job provided. Two FULL TIME people quite in my department and still no extra hours. The culture is nice and the work place is ok, there are not enough hours to learn their complicated systems and procedures when working the lowest part time hours of any work place. And if any mistakes are made you are treated like an outcast. Management is spread way to thin to be of help. Co-workers are nice and helpful, still most people there HATE their job. Employees have to go to other departments and ask for hours, most of the time there isn't any hours available. The employee discount is great and keeps a lot of employees there."
bad,"Where you get paid to lie to unsuspecting consumers praying on their lack of knowledge, Terrible management that used underhanded tactics to get personal bonuses on the back of your hard work."
bad,"Hands down one of the least organized and horrid work environments I've seen. The management at said store was borderline incompetent. Favors seasonal, temporary workers over their full employees. Notoriously bad hours, as a part time worker I was told I'd average about 15-20 hours a week, I was lucky to get more than 4 without picking up shifts from other employees."
bad,"Start up meeting talk bout the expectation for that day. You no its going to be a long day, because people dont pull there weight to get production sometimes.It waas a enjoyable part bout that job."
bad,Management was horrible and the hours suck. Would not recommend to anyone to work here. No over time was offered and customers treated us like horribly. If you want part time sure but not full time
bad,"Everyday was terrible. I was never offered breaks. I had to go out of my way to ask or else I would go the whole day without eating. The customer is NOT always right. When the customer was clearly wrong, my supervisor did not back me up and made me look foolish. My supervisor barely knew how to do his job and barely interacted with his team. My coworkers, who were suffering with me were the only reason I lasted as long as I did."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"If you are a confident male, absolutely you will thrive here. As a woman I was not only sexually harassed by both employees and managers, I was also belittled, excluded and frequently made to feel stupid and incompetent. HR took little action. The work itself was not bad, although the traffic was often very slow and at times making goals was a challenge. However, the culture of the store is singlehandedly what made this the worst job I have ever had. Women, I do not recommend this place."
bad,"Have fun working for management that are secretive and don't care about you whatsoever. Pay is alright, and so are the benefits, but management is terrible and condescending. Overall, not worth your time. Also, hard to get any breaks whatsoever since you're usually single coverage for your department."
bad,No matter how meticulously well an employee did their job management would find a way to break the moral. other employees would sabotage fellow employee's work. Very cutthroat. A job for a high school student.
bad,"the problem with Best Buy is that they hire kids to sell, but don't train them to sell."
bad,"I worked in the warehouse thats located in chino. Poor management,  the faster you do your job the more they give you. Everybody there hates it but no one leaves because of the pay. I worked there for 6 years making $19.55hr and they laid me off. No job security, i knew multiple job functions that no one else wanted to learn and that didn't matter."
bad,A lot of the sales associates think they're better than merchandisers and the managers favor the sales associates and  they don't care about merchandising
bad,"needs professional supervisors  nothing more to say"
bad,"Pay at Best Buy is reasonable, compared to most of the competition.  That being said, the organization shows no respect for individual contribution and encourages high employee churn and a strategy of gaming the system and currying favor with store management."
bad,"Harassment is tolerated, advancement is not based on merit but who you know. Very little to no support from direct supervisors in your career goals. Very clique based environment."
bad,the job was pointless and mindless. it took no skills at all and was a waste of time with no hours.merchandising was not mindful and the manager was completely UN-complient with anything that had to do with the job.
bad,Not all stores are one and the same but mine was horrible enough to ruin my whole outlook on the company. The most enjoyable part of the job were some of the customers that came in but they also made up some of the negative aspects of it.
bad,"My first day was Black Friday and I had absolutely ZERO training. I was thrown to the wolves, but I managed to pull through. After the Black Friday craze ended I was able to train but never allowed to finish because it was still very busy due to the holidays and they needed employees on the floor."
bad,"pay is rough, if your part time than your hustling for hours, no support from management, people are cool kinda like a hs setting, not a place for a career cause the company treats you like a number, gotta meet quotas and you work like if you were on commission"
bad,"Working at Best Buy definitely gave me tough skin, however it was very stressful. The company as a whole was overall great they came up with bright ideas. The worse part was the angry customers."
bad,I worked for Best Buy for a little over 14 months.  My experience there was very bad.  Management wasn't very responsive to the workers and our compensations were dreadful.
bad,The job is not as difficult as the staff makes it. I would recommend anyone else seek employment at another facility that appreciates their work and character. The management at this location needs a refresher and lacks complete respect for the employees.
bad,"This company is horrible as a management, if they like you they will prefer you, if its not,  \it is better to find another job,"
bad,You can only advance if you know someone. The scheduling is horrible. The only good perks about working here is the employee discount. Not bad for a part time job
bad,"It was asset protection, but in the end turned out to just be a wal-mart greet position. Boring long days just standing at the front, without a break."
bad,The management pushes for sales where none are to be found. God forbid you not make your quota.  Management will ride you like a horse in the Kentucky Derby weather you make sales or not
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I wish that I could say this place was amazing, but honestly it was one of the worst places I have ever worked. The management there needs a serious upgrade. They need to put the focus back on the employee. The customer is so important there that their employees are run into the ground and worn out. The things that go on in that place are deplorable. It would not fly at any other company. You could offer me $10 more an hour than what I was making and I still wouldn't go back to work there."
bad,"Management is horrible and the people there always start drama.FAVORITISM IS A DEFINITE THERE. "
bad,Says it all. Awful company that uses employees as fodder and place no value on experience. If you are useless but cheap you're in !
bad,"A lot of responsibility, but no guarantee if you would get hours."
bad,"Hours are hard to come by, managers go on firing sprees to clean house between seasons so as to hire more people under seasonal positions with no benefits."
bad,In all my time working there I have never once truly been happy walking through those doors. They suck very much. Co workers were nice. Lots of fraud and HR issues though. Hardest part of the job was not strangling dumb customers who felt entitled to your time then disregarded your opinion on what was best for their needs. There was no joy in this job.
bad,"The management was terrible. No one was ever on the same page about anything. They also refused to work around my religious beliefs. The work environment was hostile. I enjoyed what I did, but not the environment that I worked in."
bad,Beaucoup de pression venant des gérants concernant la vente même si il n'y a pas de commissions en bout de ligne.
bad,The job culture is cumbersome and hard if not impossible to achieve. Demands and expectations are high and constantly being changed by corporate. Low wages led to most co workers not caring enough to be at work promptly or doing their share during the work day.
bad,"Management is lazy, completely incompetent, and unwilling to listen to ideas from any of their employees.  They seriously lie all the time about EVERYTHING and DO NOT give recognition or appreciate those who go above and beyond.  The closest thing that will ever happen is having your name called out once a month if you happen to be a top performer in your team.  Or if you brown nose with your manager and/or team lead enough, you may receive an employee of the month award (out of 1,500 people).  But if you come up with process improvements or any kind of tools to improve things, you will not be receiving any kind of credit however."
bad,the company itself is great to work for its the management that needs help! They play favortisim and don't back up there employees after a decision they make! The pay is horrible! They tell you there is room for growth.....yea the only way to get there is to be one of there favorites!! I loved the job title that i had it was my favorite part about coming into work.....the drama that happens though is going to shut that store down!
bad,"It really is unfortunate because this location, (Bay and Dundas) is full of such committed, hard working staff who really do care about helping customers and each other, but is all burdened down by Management that consistently puts themselves first before anyone and anything else. "
bad,I will have to say that best buy has standards but really if you are hired to enforce them and enhance business practices. and do just that your in the wrong and they will let you go.
bad,Too many corporate restructures leading to downsizing and salary losses
bad,I worked in the Appliance Dept and we were not very busy.  Many people did not even know that Best Buy sold appliances. I enjoyed demonstrating all appliances when we had to.
bad,Best Buy use to be the place to work. They cared about work balance between school and family. Since there has been new management to Best Buy Store 571. Employee have quit and has been fired.  Save yourself the drama while you can. Job security is not a definite.
bad,"I don't even know if this service is still available"
bad,"When you apply to any position at best buy in Rochester, BE WARNED. They will lie to you about how great of a company it is to work for and that you'll be treated like a person and not a number...well after hearing the whole speech that i was given at my orientation i was super excited to start my job at best buy... little did i know in about a months time it would all change. The main reason why i say stay away is because of the management, Especially at the store in Greece,NY The managers are a bunch of liars. They would schedule me for full time hours for weeks when i clearly stated i could not work more than 25 hours as i was attending college full time. Along with that they would schedule me when i had classes which they did know about as they had approved my availability. When i was scheduled to work when i had class i told them i couldn't, they responded by telling me there would be disciplinary actions if i did not work the shift. Well That was the typical weekly issue at best buy. Along with the fact that they wont allow you to have a single weekend day off even if it is for religious purposes. They pass out a form stating the company minimum availability but they say right to you as they give it to you that the store requires a different policy(not in paper). So after working there for 8 months i would give this place a giant F. Do not apply to this place it will be a waste of time and bring you great unhappiness."
bad,"This job was easily 2 of the worst years of my life, that places needs a staff and manager reevaluation!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"New  GM is a lying, backstabbing lesbian. She has a cliq of employees that she talks to. She is never on time and when she is there she sits in the office. Never interacts with the entire team. With all of the recent cuts that were made as a company, she should have been 1 of them instead of the managers we lost."
bad,"Worked as a seasonal worker for the xmas season."
bad,"Though recruited with the anticipation of being a favorable experience, quickly learned that a very different side existed. "
bad,"Management Are All Biased, They Look Out For Themselves Not For The Workers. Front Lane Supervisor Is The Worst, No People Skills. All The Cashiers Hate Her ! I quit as soon as she was hired for the postition. General Manger Has ZERO Balls ! If He Sees Something wrong He Will Not Say Anything but instead Run To Assistant Managers To Address It. DO NOT WORK AT BESTBUY NORTHCHARLESTON ."
bad,"When I started at Best Buy things were great, I had fun at work and I could see myself staying there to move up the chain. I then got tired of just being a cashier so I asked if I could work some in sales. I worked as both a sales operator and a sales associate in Gaming and in Digital Imaging. I gained loads of experience that I used to move into Mobile. Now if you're going to apply for any position in the store, you want mobile. It's cushy, it's fun, and you get treated fairly well by management and other coworkers. Well I end up needing more hours, since I was struggling at my measly 18 hours per week so I applied internally for a ""full-time"" customer service position. Once I got it I found out that what the company defines as ""full-time"" isn't 40 hours per week but it's 32 or more hours per week, so it's more like 3/4 time. Through the holidays the job was great, I pretty much knew how to do it from my experience covering customer service as a sales operator and a casher, so I just had to learn the little things such as what to do in weird situations with orders, and the difficult things such as the old DOS system, which I mastered in time. Management left me alone to do my job and after about 6 months, they started coming up and micromanaging me or else I couldn't get them to come up to deal with the extremely difficult or angry customers for over 15 minutes. I told them that I've done the job just fine without them there for 6 months, but when I need them to come up I need them now. One day it took longer to get management than I usual, almost 20 minutes so I went off"
bad,"My tittle says is all. The company needs to take a look at their management staff, at least the Waterford Lake store in Orlando. As for the mobile department, they need to pay their employees like the rest of the cellular companies or a little more, nothing less than $12hr starting out. Each sales rep should have their own goals to reach with their own bonus. Then set a group bonus based on customer review."
bad,"My personal experience and those of my coworkers was not a pleasant one. Anyone who works retail knows it can suck but BB could be particularly poor. I enjoyed the social aspect, the hard work (sometimes), and being around technology and having great discounts towards buying it. On the down side BB management could be downright cruel at times, pay was unfair, unrealistic goals were set, holidays and weekend work was a must, employees were overburdened with work, and was a very stressful environment."
bad,"If you're the sort of person that likes to be micromanaged and programmed to say exactly what someone wants you to so much so that there leaves no room for your own personal experience or personality, then Best Buy is for you!"
bad,"i loved this job, i had the chance to learn and be proactive person."
bad,This job was good and the company treated us fairly to begin with and told about advancements within the company.  The problem they had is that they lied about almost everything they told us about moving up in the company.  An example was that when a new spot like a supervisor or full time opened up they would either bring someone in from another store or hire someone brand new for the spot.  They pretty much lied to their associates and still are from what I hear.
bad,"Working for best buy turned out to be different. they motto is ""informed and impartial advise"" but they are scamming people just to put the highest sales possible. As an employee, you are advised to offer the product that gives the ''Store"" the highest gain regardless of being a poor quality item. The customers have a product in mind that want as a reason to come to the store, but we have to try to convince the customer to pick the low-quality just to make a buck (highest  margin). "
bad,"They exploit the kids they have working for them. Lie about union organization so their employees wont join one."
bad,"When you work you just have to work, from starting shift to ending shift and you do get a break. The management team does not help the employes and their goals. And the management team has no communication and doe not know how to do their job"
bad,"It was a fun place to work because of the co-workers but the management made it terrible. We went through so many managers in just a few short months it made it hard to work there. The hardest part of the job was the constant badgering about sales. No matter how much you sale, it was NEVER good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was the perks. The discounts and the butt-kissing you would get from companies to sell their products more. A computer brand brought the store pizza, drinks, and gave us each $25 gift cards just to sale their stuff more. "
bad,"Company is not too concerned on the moral the produce for their employees. The Pay is low for the amount of work required, and the management is a joke"
bad,"i was hired under false pretense and lied to by a former gm who was fired two moths later. This is one of the worst places to be employed at . Do not apply here unless you have another job or need holiday Cash . This employer has a outdated mentality when comes to retail , you have to be productive every hour on the hour bringing dollars into the store if not they cut labor in heart beat."
bad,Your job as a tech is not to be a tech but a salesman. Granted if I wanted a sales job I would have applied for a sales job. I applied for a tech position and got a sales job. At the end of the day its not how many problems you solved but how much product and service you sold.
bad,-Stood at counter and processed returns and angry customers
bad,A typical day would be to go behind other geek squad technicians and fix what they messed up or calm down a angry customer and get them to like bestbuy again.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Tough environment, have to work a lot more than you should. Continue to eliminate positions and stock drops daily. No sense of job security."
bad,"work as a team easy to get along with co workers but very lazy managers I don't understand how they let there employees take harassment from customers and wont help or fix the problems they rather hid in the back and ignore the situation. As an employee who dose not get paid the mangers salary tries to always help the customers, there satisfaction is my goal for them to always return."
bad,from management all the way up they suck. they have no respect them give you no chances to mess up and its a sucky part time job that preaches hard work and sales sales sales and then you kill it and you get no recognition. The only people that got there attention that basically cheated to get all his numbers up
bad,"Management hounds you to sell warranty, yet your not on commission. if they hit their numbers they go to Hawaii and the people who got them those numbers get nothing. "
bad,This place is ok if you are in high school or  college and need money to buy cool things but are not looking for a long term job. Geek Squad was great before it was ran by best buy.
bad,"I was hired for the gaming department and moved even though making it clear i knew nothing about cameras and then got let go for that reason. I attended the basic camera class which taught me nothing about wjat the questions customers asked about cameras. I was told to move sales to reps since they were reps and would get repremanded for not making enough sales but when i would try to do a sale alone, i would have to lie about my knowledge since i knew nothing about cameras... I was let go as a seasonal day of while being told all year that they would keep me on permanently. They did it to everyone apperently. Wasnt helpful on bills i had to pay while trying to find a new job."
bad,"The workplace isn't that great to work as you are not given your appropriate hours and its kind of unhealthy for you to work. The staff is very much biased most of the times, and if you don't perform well once, they will continue to have the same perception. The job isn't commissioned based but still they push you to make sales. The only way they can determine one's performance in the company is not just selling the products, they sell by themselves but by how many warranties you are selling and it is kind of hard to push onto that. "
bad,N/A not intrested in discussing how I feel about the company it's terrible and the have no care for there employees give people an option to skip this.
bad,"This was temp job during their busy season, Product process does the work that no one else wants to do, at 1 point i was working days and nights in the same week.  I would start at 8pm finish at 3am, then have to be back the same day at 10am till 5pm.  Most of my job was spent working on my own with no direction from Management.  "
bad,Management is overly concerned about their success and only attempting to coincide your future with their goals and not considering yours. Claim to care about you but would abandon you quickly if they are not reaching expected goals as a store
bad,"Your first job, good if you like tech, good discounts. don't aim to stay too long. There is a lot of favoritism among upper management. they really dont care about you"
bad,It was a great job if you were picked as the boss' favorite otherwise it was terrible working there. The other employees were very rude and condescending. The management was terrible and changed every 6 months progressively getting worse each time.
bad,"The only thing that matters to them is making your sales goals. They treat you like you are commission but don't pay you like it. The customer is only good for 1 thing, to get as much as you can from them."
bad,"not a place for introverts and non sales type people. Unless you provide directly to the bottom line, your role goes unappreciated. On top of that, if you are introverted, other employees form cliques around you and eventually sully your reputation with management. Work here if you are immature, looking for high fives and loose friends."
bad,"Sent our jobs overseas to save money!  Would never trust them again.  Did not matter your job tenure, seems like they wanted to get rid of the higher paid workers that had been there the longest."
bad,They push you to make sells as if u r a car salesman. You get no commision and no incentive whatsoever. There use to be a monthly bonus but that was taken away. You gotta drink some bs kool aid and be favorited by management if u wanna move up the ladder to a position that the company may get rid of soon. If there are no customers its as if mangment wants u to pull sales out of ur a**
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Management SUCKS!!! If it’s not beneficial to the management NOTHING ELSE MATTERS!! The company overall is okay, but only for college students! If you’re not hired into the store management wise, but want to reach that experience, I suggest you find somewhere else to go... I’ve seen managers come in go within the time I’ve been there... don’t waste your time if you want a career!!!"
bad,"Favoritism was a big concern there."
bad,"Only do this job if you're desperate, like early mornings (5-7am start, 3 or 4 am during holidays), and love going to work with others who never show up."
bad,"Do not work here unless you enjoy having your hours cut, being talked down upon by management and having mostly men being promoted with very little experience."
bad,"The upper management at the Tracy,CA location creates such an unhealthy environment.  ASM is too busy instigating issues within the store, pinning employees against other employees or management. They warn new hires to stay away from certain people or departments already planting the seed for more drama. GM ignores all issues that go on and won’t give fair raises to those who deserve them. Avoid this location at all cost. Not worth the problems you’re walking into."
bad,My time at Best Buy had ups and downs. My last year with Best Buy was an awful experience. I was positioned as a manager but had no control a manager should have and was held accountable for not addressing issues when I would try and address them and address the issue but was not allowed by upper management.
bad,If you're not a favorite you don't go anywhere with the company can you get treated badly you get stuck doing the grunt work and if you even so much as think of taking an extra minute on your break you get wrote up for stealing time but only if you're not a favorite. They lie a lot as well.
bad,Mangement will pay you minimum amount possible and doesn’t want to see you grow in the business. They would rather hire outside of the location vs internally. Will only interact with you when you are doing something wrong.
bad,Pto and pay are great. SRD is nothing but clique of friends who treat new people badly.  Management plays favorites and it was there top issue when the company was given work surveys. Theres zero chance to move anywhere inthe company. No overtime ever. SRD is alot of work and the field dfms ate great but the room you work in is a nightmare.
bad,"Managers only concern is trying to make themselves look good. They don't care about you.  All they care about is climbing the corporate ladder. Tons of work to be done, but, for some reason, they stay sending everyone home early. Hired as a full-time employee but have to complain and beg for full-time hours. Made more, hourly, here than at previous job but still came home with less."
bad,It was extremely frustrating working for Best Buy. The store I worked at only cared about the revenue attainment for the month. I tried for over a year to get them to clean up some of the report but it would negatively affect the month and they kept putting it off. As a sales person I had to be concerned with a peer that would steal everyone sales and they would do nothing about it because he was a top performer.
bad,"You had to be a part of the cheerleader squad to progress and move forward with the company.  Not at all for the introvert.  Made to be part of a greater scheme to ""sell"" items to a customer they did not need."
bad,"Complain on employee, nothing is done.  Management has favorites aND they are clearly obvious. Called a liar when I talked to Papa roach via Instagram"
bad,Moved onto other employment my time at bestbuy was good and rewarding i learned lots and became very knowledgeable of different technology but our paths went into different ways.
bad,"I am a former employee, who thought the company was going to be a great career at the start. That was quickly shot down after I saw that the management had no backbone to discipline the employees who stole company time, and did not do their jobs. The training is poor and sales reps have no passion to go beyond to help the customer."
bad,"Better not hurt yourself on the job or not, their be looking for any excuse to get rid of you. The store managers and supervisors only look out for themselves if they don't like you for whatever reason you'll have a Target on your back."
bad,"Good company, and I would have loved to work for them, but since I can earn considerably more money delivering Pizza for Dominos, I will just keep doing that instead."
bad,"In my experience of working at Best Buy, I noticed after a 3 months that when it came to anything in store, they were very revenue driven. If a department did not hit revenue, even if they capitalized on everyone that came in, they would basically be reprimanded. From there, warehouse employees are treated unfairly and expected to do all the grunt work. My supervisor at the time for ware house received a demeaning email stating that Ware house work should be easy. That we were “just box pushers”."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Extremely weak management. No managers are accountable and no managers are willing to be accountable."
bad,"follow the SOP, keep your mouth shut, and your ideas are not welcome here.  Corporate employee support, isn't.  Don't waste time telling corporate your manager is falsifying reports."
bad,"I worked in store almost 5 years. Customer Service/Front End role. I took it upon myself to learn as I was given the opportunity. I left because management at my store was out to fire and get rid of people. I didnt have intentions of leaving when I did. It in general was a turnover in leadership. I enjoyed my previous manager, he saw potential in people and encouraged them. I grew as a person, personally and professionally because of his leadership. Other leaders will do just enough to get by and make it look like they are doing their job. "
bad,"everyday was stressful inventory would come off the truck was placed anywhere, customers would request product took over 10 mins to find anything was bad. they want you to focus on customer service then get upset when you help them, job was very confusing was not a great experience for someone new to retail."
bad,"No commision on sales is fine and I understand why, it helps get the customer what they need vs. what's expensive, but then having expected revenue goals that are not adjusted to the real world (Bad weather and no customers? Well you should have tried to sell harder!) coupled with poor management and stagnating job positions leads to workplace stress. "
bad,"Working at Geek Squad used to be a very enjoyable position. I, and my other Consultation Agents, used to diagnose and work closely with computers. Recently the company has changed the position to little more than customer service and has removed the computer repair aspect of the position."
bad,There was no supervisor in the department I was working in so store management is who told us what to do. They favored certain colleges and did not like new people. 10 hours a week was given. petty.
bad,"Constantly had my schedule changed in the middle of the week with no warning. I showed up for a scheduled shift only to find out it had been changed the day before with no warning and I was given a call out even though I showed up and worked my original shift. There were a couple of times they tried to give me 0 hours for the week (during Christmas holiday). Managers seemed too busy or just didn't care about employee problems. The ""One Direction"" sales plan basically just trains a bunch of box readers. They seem to be trying to create a competitive sales plan without a competitive sales wage. They want you to out perform other employees with little to no incentive to do so. It seemed like they cared less about costumer satisfaction and more about revenue/hour and credit card apps."
bad,"The company is great.  The Security department is ridiculous, has no direction or organization and can't respond well during crisis events.  The management is rife with favoritism, negativity and hostility."
bad,"Goals that cant be met and forcing employees to slyly coerce customers in to things they don't need or without telling them in order to meet goals. I learned Sales Support, Sales, Geek Squad, and administrative duties. Most Management was deceitful with a pep talk. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines with high volume and had to got approved overtime. The best part of the job was some of the co-workers who worked with me and for me."
bad,"Work here as a cashier, didn't learned much in this job. Get hired in the month of Black Friday. Around that time they give me 30ish hours. But after holiday they start give me 8-20 per week."
bad,I worked at BestBuy for a year and I would not recommend it to anyone. Not only do you have to put up with clients treating you unfairly but management is not supportive and there are very few advancement opportunities. Holiday time is a joke and they will have employees working 12 hour shifts on Black Friday. Very unethical practices were going on which led me to leave the company.
bad,"I repaired laptops at the warehouse in brooks Kentucky.  The culture there was fantastic when the place first opened, but went down hill over the years.  I would never recommend this place to another person for employment."
bad,Got a new boss in the department that would rather talk behind people's backs and report to management and human resources because they are insecure. Never received any help from management regarding issues. Management would throw employees under the bus for their short-comings.
bad,Its great for college kids and people who are just looking for a job for a little money. They do not pay a living wage and advancement is hard to come by.
bad,"this is a horrible place to work. co workers are so full of drama and like to talk behind their ""friends"" backs and act like they're still in high school, they also like to spread lies and rumors. managers take advantage of the fact that they're managers and like to belittle the workers."
bad,"I love the people at Best Buy, but for whatever reason, from Christmas 2016 on, the part-timers in Product Process only get 4 hours per week.  8 hours if you are lucky.  Best Buy, how the heck am I supposed to pay my mortgage on that ???  I didn't even get any hours on Boxing Day !!  How mind-boggling is that ???  On Boxing Day it's supposed to be ""all hands on deck"" with people working up to 12 hours if they want it.  But I never got the chance to even participate !  If you want to work at Best Buy, work as a Cashier or at Ops, they're the ones who get the hours.  Stay away from Product Process!  In 2015 I was able to work 30 hours per week which kept me up to date on my mortgage, but not anymore!  Forget you Best Buy Canada, I am gone and I am never going back !!!"
bad,The position i was in payed great and definitely has plenty of over time. 50-80 hours a week. 50 being the norm. obviously there wasnt much of a home life with these hours. Management is dicey. poorly ran ship to say the least. ive worked at 3 different locations in 2 cities and its the same everywhere i went. I absolutely loved my job and what i was doing. but the company itself is leading me to look elsewhere.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Best Buy wouldnt be a bad place to work if they were realistic about the workload for their supervisors. They are expected to coach and train 95% of their time, mostly to provide customers ""complete solutions"" while also supervising multi million dollar a year departments. Unrealistic workload from disconnected upper management."
bad,Pay is good but not for what they expect. There's little flexibility and there is no longer a culture and sense of belonging to the company.
bad,"Best Buy, as I have experienced it, has been the very definition of a money hungry performance at all costs organizations that demands the most unreasonable results of its stores and leadership teams- this on a regular basis! The culture as taught to me first hand by a senior General Manager and otherwise heartless ROBOMANAGER is one that sounded a bit like this: "" We pay you to do what you are told exactly as you are told to do it. Do you think that if it wasn’t for the paycheck that I would be here?"" OMG!!! I am not kidding!!! Good times right???? Harldly, it is sad and luckily I am not entrenched into a situation that I cannot escape like some of my peers who deserve so much better. Some more fun facts: There is ZERO work life balance and there is a continuous stream of insulting and debasing expectations that are thrust upon you daily. Of course you will find a fluffy underbelly of pure propaganda that is generated to pretend as if there is a heart to the company but the actions of the leaders speak volumes to the true character of what is generally allowed and to what is the common leadership reality within this awful company. I have had countless conversations with GREAT associates who are treated as disposable assets on a daily basis. They are not valued nor do they feel any real future is available to them. It is very common for an hourly associate ( a high performer no less ) to have over 5 years with Best Buy and make $10-12 an hour. Shameful!! Do yourself a favor and believe EVERY horrible thing you have ever heard regarding the Best Buy leadership experience. Avoid"
bad,"I worked at two different locations in a variety of different positions. In the end my experience was horrible. There is clear favouritism and most managers have a secondary agenda. In the end it was an extremely toxic workplace. The things I have learned about this Company are disgusting, you can get away with anything and everything if you're a favourite of the higher ups. They specifically speak against retaliation in their policy but people do it ALL the time. Harassment claim? Don't expect anything. Sometimes managers will tell you who made the claim!! Fight on store property? If your a favourite you get promoted! Mention your wage? Get fired immediately though, goodness forbid any transparency."
bad,Typical day involves covering other departments or performing duties that are not part of my primary role all while unrealistically expecting to my primary duties.  Because I worked in a specialized skill dept. I/we never received any assistance from other dept or management. In terms of technical skills didn't really learn anything new. Technical resources to do your basic job are below par and are not able to keep up with the workload or what is expected of me. The GM has consistently shown favoritism to a circle of people from his old location. Vacant positions are given/promised out to those in the circle before they are barely posted for anyone to apply.  I do have a passion for problem solving so I enjoyed that aspect when I was able to utilize my tech skills and knowledge.
bad,Inexcusable unfair treatment and severe lack of recognition. Management favortises certain individuals above all else no matter how much an individual is dedicated and supportive in their role
bad,"Family work life balance was awful, little to no pay without overtime opportunity. Did not take females seriously when I work there for leadership opportunities"
bad,"Best Buy is a terrible place to work, especially in either IT or eCommerce. The culture is toxic unless you are a “yes person”. They have a very hard time retaining good people, and they can only retain the grinders who are fearful of job security. A lot of them are actually very good too   Lots of people are stressed out and their best executives have left either for Best Buy US or to run MEC.  companies (I.e. MEC)."
bad,"I can’t write enough of a yikes for how you’re treated here. "
bad,"They say they are not on commission, but the level of stress is far beyond any commission environment.  They track your numbers down to the hour, every thing you do is micromanaged. Their Total tech subscription they make you push is a joke. Only a few customers really need it , but you are required to sell 1 per shift and if you don’t you have to have a coaching session each time you don’t."
bad,This is an OK company to work for been there for a very long time ..  just looking for a new opportunity somewhere else to expand my career .................
bad,"It’s great at first, I love the people I work with especially since it’s a small department and everyone is close together. But after a year it has gone downhill dramatically. The department manager is not present and spends 90% of their time on the sales floor. The GM has refused to give decent pay increase to anyone in our department but dumps manager issues on us to deal with. Instead of trying to guide employee and help them improve/move up in the company they have treated us terribly and underpaid us until we quit and then they hire new employees to milk until those ones ask for better pay. Constantly screw over the hard working and dedicated employees."
bad,Worst management ever in my entire career. Set up to fail in every angle possible. Message to them: Don't destroy a persons self esteem because they are not a right fit for you. Help them find a right fit. Just gross.
bad,I am part time in my store and even after explaining to management that I can’t live on 14 hours a week and that I recently became homeless and couldn’t afford to eat and pay bills they couldn’t even afford to give me more hours.
bad,Es un vientre entretenido y da tiempo de realizar otras actividades personales sin embargo el sueldo es bajo
bad,I worked there for 2 years and not once did they try to help train me to move up despite asking for it. The managers can do what they want and it caused all the good workers to leave.
bad,"A typical day at work usually includes checking your phone whenever you can and avoiding customers. "
bad,Manager causes too much negativity. If he can’t intimidate you he will be nice to your face and talk about you behind your back. Unrealistic goals for full time front end.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I was hired on and told I was a permanent part of my team as a full time employee. I did my best to take on new lessons and learn from my current supervisor at the time. I had alot of heart and care about customers, but the unrealistic goals of sales was unreal. "
bad,Its a job.  My manager was  incompetent and her  hygiene isn’t up to par in my opinion. She smells of urine or mildew. She shows favoritism and the only thing she is good at is flirting with other associates.
bad,This job is meant for someone in school or under 23.  The managers are young in inexperienced or older and jaded.  The only people that advanced were the people that were hanging out with the managers outside of work.
bad,"Training for incoming managers was not organized nor structured."
bad,"Worked there during college, constantly trying to improve my self within companies. Managers pick favorites and will allow elevate them above others. Working holidays and long hours without any real compensation. Management gets huge holiday bonuses."
bad,nothing really to say it was a okay job but more for younger people in school trying to earn couple dollars. I would recommend it to younger people nothing more
bad,"Best Buy is a good company to work for, but it depends on the upper management if you have a health work culture. The culture I work for is toxic. Be careful"
bad,"Pay and management is why i left, its like a high school drama tv show there. management only cares about hitting card apps and disregards employees needs"
bad,"Management was hard to deal with."
bad,"If your 16 and looking for a job with minimal training and no job security. This place is for you. If your looking to make this a career. Then forget it. The leadership team in this company is based on how much you can make others feel bad, horrible meetings that don't go anywhere and no trust in leadership team or team members."
bad,"For one, the managers don't actually seem to care about anyone but themselves. I worked seasonally, the way they let me go (same deal with the other seasonal employees) was by REMOVING US FROM THE COMPANY GROUP CHAT WITHOUT NOTICE. I, along with many others, had to find out that we got let go through the friends we made while working there. Don't work here until the management gets changed out."
bad,"The company itself is wonderful just watch out for the location you want, as when working under a ex future shop manager well it was not a good situation. He would be the most friendliest manager to your face and yet go to other employees and talk down about employees and when confronted it would be a complete different story. He throws all of his employees under the bus when things go wrong and would hold himself accountable for his own actions/ mistakes. You are supposed to live by the values that are in place there but he does not. The worst is when I was terminated without cause I made a formal complaint to the district manager and to this day have not heard a response which shows that the company does not like to hear about the truth or issues going on they just cover it up with a bandaid and move on, which any complaint should be addressed in a timely manner."
bad,"The new GM wants the employees to fear for their job, has no regard for employees, how ever other employees make it a fun place to work if you ignore the GM"
bad,"Managers do not know how to do there jobs, one manager would tell you to do something, the other would tell you another, the hours never where the same."
bad,"I was on the opening of the Woodbridge Ontario location.  "
bad,Best buy has a great company culture. However they have poor benefits and poor opportunities for advancement.They are headquartered somewhere in Minnesota.
bad,would not advance many part time employees. I believe this was because they did not have to pay for health insurance/ other benefits of a full time worker and work you during peak shopping hours. Only received full time if you where friends with the management.
bad,Your co worker are either amazing or whiny and completely unreliable. The manager for the whole store is amazing but the supervisors are cliquey and will try to get you in trouble rather than helping you advance
bad,"Heaven help you if you are in a rev band 1 store. corporate doesn't care if you live or die."
bad,"Told them I was leaving in the summer to give them time to find someone new. Terminated me in January because I would affect turnover rate, never called just was taken off the schedule. Had to ask what was up, their response ""we thought you would be quitting anyway""."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Benefits are there, but difficult to access."
bad,"trash this place is an absolute dumpster fire, I was paid less than 1 percent of what I bring to the company in revenue and sales. that is absolutely outrageous"
bad,The day started with a staff exercises and trust games. Such a waste of time. Management expectation too demanding beyond normal job description of duty and function.
bad,"A company that fits the stereotypical greedy retail landscape. Once a company that truly cared about it customers and employees, is now just another retail company out for maximizing their profit at the cost of customer service and the well being of their employees. Do not seek a career here because there is very little opportunity due to constant downsizing of their workforce. Workloads are beyond any reasonable expectations. Benefits are decent. Expect to work every holiday, verbally abused by customers, and to lose any kind of relationship with family and friends. The best part of this job is when you punch out and go home to release all anger, stress, and anxiety. All of which you are guaranteed to experience while working here."
bad,"Nothing to advance within the company.  When I worked there, I knew that I knew more than any associate.  Their online training courses are a joke."
bad,Higher pressure job with little care given to its employees. To much meetings and micro managing not enough support on the sale floor to help with customer and support own staff. The company is to focused on reinventing retail and ignores stores needs in smaller markets
bad,I was one of the best workers and still there was never enough time allocated to finish tasks. Other than that the co-workers I had were great. Even some of the managers were pretty awesome.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Only opportunity to increase pay is going into management. Your sales ability has no bearing on your pay, so if you do a great job and make the company lots of money, you still get paid the same as if you did nothing all day."
bad,you can not make a living and support yourself simply working at best buy. Best Buy does not pay enough to sustain a life. But expect an employee to be fully committed to the job and work you as if you were paid really well. that is why there is such a high rate of turn over. Most employees are working at Best Buy tell they can find another job. FACT !
bad,"I worked at One touch direct for Best Buy, and after three years of working for them i have found that they are a horrible company that does not care about its employees. They will not help anyone that truly needs it as they simply do not care everyone is just a number that can be replaced."
bad,"This company is so corrupt it's not even funny! I would assume the other location is the same way, but when I started working at Best Buy, it was fast, easy, and great communication.  I started on cash, then I got moved to another location for PPA team, turns out this place was run by foreigners and once I started working at this location, they laid me off for no reason!"
bad,"Worked there when I got out of the military and was going back to school. Managers acted high and mighty and often ignored associates, especially the newer ones. 8 hour shifts and only got one 5 minute break. Managers talked down to me like I was an idiot. Was never even given a work shirt, just told to wear one of my own shirts. I personally won't even step foot back in there to shop after seeing how they acted and treated people."
bad,"The ""higher ups"" are all about protecting each other and not the rest of teh employees. you only get promoted if you are a favorite, not based on your skill or talent."
bad,I've only worked at my location for a year and none of the original managers still work there. It's not a good place to go for long term employment.
bad,"Horrible company, bad managment team, plays favoritism, no chance for advancing, also, no breaks and sucky hours, someone should call labor board on this company"
bad,"I enjoyed being apart of the Grand Opening in Traverse City. I was hired on as a Sr. Admin. I liked being busy and have a variety of task to do through out my shift. Half my day was spent working within the office handling store reports, deposits and all other reporting that needed to be handled. I also worked training other new hires and handling of customer service duties. Over a course of several months there was a big turn over in management and unfair practices which was not suitable for a good work environment."
bad,"Was not managed well at all, the co-workers made it enjoyable, but too bad their was alot of favouritism and favouring the same employees over and over again, and if you don't play hockey, don't expect to get full-time at this Best Buy, they only want their hockey friends working here..  Put a bad taste in my mouth about Best Buy forsure.."
bad,This is the most unprofessional organization I've ever worked for in my 10 plus years in the customer service field. There was never a manager around to assist when in a difficult situation and when you tried to provide feedback the higher management or supervisor refused to accept.
bad,"Over charge for simple repairs, the tech support they offer isnt worth the price. The prog that they use to clean computers isnt as effective as they say. The consultation agent is constantly pressured everyday for selling their tech support. No room for advancement unless your best friends with your manager, theres so much micro management, and if your not a top seller then they cut your hours even if your part time. I worked 12 hours this week and ive got 4 days off in a row, this week and next. Terrible representation of their company brand with terrible employees who lie to customers, and sucker them into buying tech support, even if its not needed. They last 2 times i applied for another position with in the company i never received acknowledgment from my manager, lead, i did however receive rejection letters, for a position that others i worked with got interviews for. If you think you will go far in this place. Also if your certified for A+, C+ they wont care, they wont compensate you for your certifications, theyd rather you be Geek Squad certified which is a group of pretentious nerds who make the training. Ill tell you this, if you have a good supervisor then you should have no problems, BUT if that supervisor leaves just know they will put in someone who wont compare to that supervisor."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Best Buy is a con artist company. They con customers in to repairs they do not need."
bad,"When you have system issue due to their equipment and VPN, they will not take ownership and will expect you to still perform your job duties regardless if you have the necessary resources to. Then when you are not able to work and Help desk could resolve your issues they will fire you."
bad,Some days would be extremely busy and others extremely slow. Co-workers were great to work with.
bad,"No room for advancement, the best part about the job is the co workers"
bad,"A typical day of work at Best Buy is kind of boring. All I do as a salesman is talk with customers about products. Don't get me wrong I love interacting with customers, but that's it. I have no real responsibilities and that makes the day go by very slow."
bad,"When they are done with you,you're gone and then they fight the unemployment,too many inexperienced managers making bad decisions"
bad,"the job is forever changing, one moment you are doing one thing, than you're told the  whole time you were doing it wrong"
bad,"	Effectively manages a diverse workforce by ensuring consistent execution of employee processes including hiring, recruiting and promotions."
bad,"I've worked for Best Buy for 2 years and I have not gotten a raise or been promoted, I'm still working at the front lanes. I've have been #1 in my district, territory, and stores that I've worked in for Best Buy app's and #2 for GSP since I've started with the company in July 2011. My pay is horrible nobody can live off of $10.00 an hours being on their own and the fact that I'm only part time I hate. Best Buy should offer more pay and have more full time positions in the front lanes instead of hiring more people as part time. I've asked for full time so I can get health benefits and more hours but of course I'm always told that they only have part time in the front lanes and in order to get more hours you basically have to be the BEST in your department. They don't care if your making ends meet. I've tried searching for another job but in this economy it's hard, I guess I'm stuck at Best Buy making pocket change every pay check, with no promotion, and only part time. Best Buy CEO should do UNDERCOVER BOSS and come to my store so I can tell him how I feel about this company in a respectful way."
bad,i liked the job because the job previous to this one was the same thing ( selling phones). it was easy to catch on to there system but the company played favoritism. the location i was working in wasnt a stable location. it had many different employees in its not even year of being open 
bad,"Treat employees terribly, Can short your paycheck if you are not careful. Pay nothing for high dollar, high energy sales, push opening of high interest rate credit cards to indigent people."
bad,"I was working at one in aurora the staff was mostly teens including our manager who was 20. If the leads dont like you, you get sent home early. The training was nothing no one ever roled played or made sure i knew what i was doing before being thrown into a task. When I asked a question i was looked at like i was stupid.. But how do you expect me to know when I only work a 4 hour shift twice in a pay period. Horrible experience with this company I would never work for a company that runs off of highschool popularity contests againg.."
bad,"Okay so when you first start out you barely get any hours due to the fact you don't know anyone, then once you prove yourself they overload you with hours! The management team sucks, 90% of them are fake! They only care about the geek squad plans and credit card apps, so if you suck at that expect to only work 8 hours a week. They write you up for the stupidest of things and it is just not worth working there."
bad,"You can learn a lot, problem is they use it to their advantage and abuse you for the little they pay you. You are not in a secure place unless your a good salesmen."
bad,On a regular basis you hear about how bad you and the rest of the company is sucking and failing. Your hours and pay are cut on a regular basis. You constantly wonder not if but when will you be the next person to be laid off. You also get to enjoy being micromanaged everyday! They also give great perks and then take them back such as the employee discount and then say it is to save your job but then lay you off a couple months later anyway.
bad,good for colledge student and people that have a passion about electronics. They rarely have stock on most major promos. They really don't care about appliances. Beaware that this company generally tend to terminate people before end of first year. They really don't like to give benifits out.
bad,"nobody really wants to be there and the focus on numbers, credit card applications, and leads heavily with no benefit to employees for getting those goals"
bad,"There was little to no training when I started, very unclear job accountability.  I went to my manager numerous times asking for clear definition and guidance and received no action."
bad,"This was a good job but then I got sexually harassed and know did anything about it till after I left the management is a joke and need to be review, it's all based on favoritism there tou wont move up unless you're close to some one there"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Existen preferencias a algunos colaboradores, solo tienes beneficios si le hacés la barba a tu supervisor, no existe el compañerismo, siempre están al pendiente de lo que haces mal para reportarlo al supervisor. RH te la pinta bonito pero la realidad es otra muy distinta."
bad,busy moving place to place installing tvs and other devices. downtime was  checking out stores setup and products . Working with other departments magnolia
bad,"My operation manager don't know how to read or write emails. He ask me to write his emails..He was a picker I trained him and now he is my manager. My area manager asked me to finish her E-learning. Now guess who is smart and should be a manager. "
bad,"Under paid is an understatement for the work you put in and the amount of money you make for the company. They can't keep good people to stay and, work the good ones to the last bit of strength is demolished. Then ask why arnt you being consistent with your work"
bad,"Management is awful, I know that’s a common issue at most entire level jobs but here it is by far the worst, the front end manager just bosses you around and I’ve asked him to show me how to do things and all he’ll do is yell at me when I mess up because he won’t show me, the rest of the managers still like to yell at you to do stuff your not supposed/allowed to do due to your job code, the managers understand the working part of their job but not at all on the leadership part."
bad,"As a company they brag about being rated one of Canada's top employers, and they love to mention their ""no pressure"" sales approach. It's all a sham. Many of my co-workers will resort to scare tactics or lies to sell service plans. They're all about gross margin and upselling. Typical corporate, everything is about profit, and management is all about making sure they get their bonuses."
bad,Must hit sales goal everyday someway somehow. I became extremely depressed and stressed out at the end of my job there. Management was ready to fire me when I did not reach my goals when the next year but then I gave them my two weeks notice. I had trouble with most of the management there.
bad,"As with many corporate jobs, working for Best Buy makes you feel disposable and unimportant despite the amount of work and hours you pour into your job"
bad,you can grow and learn about technology and different products.  Flexible schedule as a part timer. weekly training hands on and on the internet. Good start up
bad,"Not really open to opinions a lot of close minded individuals in management."
bad,"I worked at Best Buy for over a year as a part time worker, the co-workers are all pretty cool but no place for advancement, management is trash, and no recognition. "
bad,"The particular store i worked at was a zombie store, in other words: it had enough foot traffic and sales to appease district managers consistently so all other problems were ignored. "
bad,"Very difficult to be hired, but if you are hired, not much job security, they let 64 permanent people go when I was a temp there, and every permanent worker I talked to had only been there 3 or 4 yrs at the most 5yrs so I think they let people go every few years so they won't have to pay raises, retirement, etc.some people were temps there for 2 yrs and never got hired, they just use their temps to get their workload done then let them go. Rotten!"
bad,"I worked there for a bit, but realized quickly that no matter if you were making sales and selling warranties(no commission yet your pressured to sell them) you still won't be appreciated for your efforts"
bad,Je me sentais pas alaise il y avait de la discrimination
bad,Very focused on numbers.  No concern for how metrics affect employee moral. Position was eliminated during the reorg and then I tried to find another position to apply for and I got no where.  No concern for their employees.
bad,"I was led on to believe I would be hired after completing 320 hours of employment with a staffing agency and never happened.  Multiple departments lied to me about it over the course of nine months.  During that time, I never once had a paid sick or vacation day.  The temporary workers typically work harder than the Geek Squad employees because they're trying to prove to management that they're worthy of being hired on.  After Geek Squad employees received $1000 bonuses that the temporary workers were not eligible for, I finally had it and quit."
bad,"The point of this job was to help customers choose what computer what best for what THEY needed. We were told to upsell, lie and  and even scan items the customer did not pay for in order to up our profits. This is completely against my moral standards. Even though I was seasonal, I was let go because I help customers and informed them rather than deceived them...."
bad,"The hardest part about leaving Best Buy is the pay. You are paid well for your work. But the work is difficult, and goals are often unattainable no matter how hard you work. You never feel appreciated. Your work is never good enough. The way HR is set up is a complete joke. Some GREAT managers and leaders in the company, and quite a few Terrible ones as well. The Market Director for Seattle is amazing, but unfortunately the district manager and the hr manager for the area are terrible. If you want to work every weekend and every holiday for thankless work, this job is for you."
bad,Management had a tendency to promote people they hung out with outside of work regardless of how bad that employee may be.  They made sure to lie and misdirect employees about interviewing for full time spots so they didn't have to promote people they weren't friends with.  Allowed certain people to carry their weight and do their job while others could avoid work unless extremely busy.  At one point they actually had to have the underlings start training every person above them in my department because not a single one knew anything about the department over 3 or 4 of us underlings.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Employees were mean and never wanted to help or teach. Also managers are very mean and judgmental and your can’t come up throughout the company. Just wasn’t fun at all
bad,"No commission, low pay, but still has the Sell, Sell, Sell, attitude. "
bad,I was told a few things that were lies and my pay never changed and I never got the hours they told me i would get because i was not making anywhere near enough for my bills and the drive was never worth it!
bad,It’s sell or be fired everyone is forced to compete for an ideal career experience. The only good part is they hire really good people and the people you get hired with make the experience better.
bad,"I worked in a role where I would travel the entire country, seeing different stores and different leadership, so I know it’s not just one or two locations in one region, Best Buy promotes bad people for their leadership roles and pushes out the good people who managed to get into leadership. It’s a good place to work as long as you don’t have any management interaction."
bad,"Managed a $5 Million big box electronic retail store.  Was responsible for the day to day sales operation, challenged to change the culture of the sales team.  I was able to do this with extensive re-training and goal setting"
bad,I have worked for two best buys and both have bad management and terrible hours. It's very hard to make friends in customer service department because they isolate you from everyone else. Customers can be very rude and stupid.
bad,"We had a handful of employees leave in about a 6 month period. They refused to replace any of them leaving the department short staffed thus everyone in the department was overworked. At that time I was a full-time student and wasn't allowed ample time for my academics. The last straw was when I requested unpaid time off for a personal reason a month in advance. I never got notification that my request was denied or approved. About a week before the time that I had requested off, I got in touch with the manager in charge of the schedule. He then informed me that my request was denied because of the short staff we had in my department. I was basically working full-time when I only wanted about twenty to twenty-five hours per week and was hired as only a part-time employee. This is the reason I left. I left for a rival company and never regretted my decision. I earn more than two dollars an hour more than I did at Best Buy. Also I receive full health benefits and paid time off. Best Buy never offered any of those type of benefits and treated me as I was expendable so I left for greener pastures."
bad,Best Buy is a great job for a student that needs flexibility in hours. I wouldn't recommend making a career of it. Great for a first time job seeker attempting to get into the job market.
bad,"Employees at Markville best buy are the best they are very fun and outgoing, but the management there sucks. The general manager is a self centred, biased,racist individual. Who is one of the fakest people you will ever meet. Thank god i don't work there anymore, the past months have been the best relief ever. I felt so trapped at that best buy, it was unbelievable. Felt a whole lot of stress off my shoulder after i left."
bad,"Authoritative management style, this is company wide. Meetings at all levels would be about being held accountable and someone else doing the job.  Threatening environment."
bad,If you want to work here you'll have to deal with a high school type of environment; There's nothing but drama and management is far from professional
bad,"There was a mass investigation with the entire management staff when I got hired due to company theft, drug use, alcohol in the work place, and fraternization with employees. I was wearing my interview close when I operated a register when I got the job and went in to finish my hiring process. The entire management team had relationships  with the associates, not including me. I was the second top credit card seller (with no commision) in the store and rewarded me with an 11 hour work schedule. If you are an attractive college student, homosexual, or like abuse of any kind then you will strive in this company."
bad,"I worked my butt off for this company for months and still got little to no hours, newer people got promoted before I ever did. I remember one time I spent a whole 2 hours cleaning an entire warehouse of tv's BY MYSELF and still was told by my manager ""you gotta earn the hours"". Management would not lead by example but instead lead by fear. My supervisor in particular would literally tell me to shut up for just saying something nice. I am probably just unlucky to have landed in that part of Best Buy but who knows. The company itself has no growth for part timers, and has more initiative to harass there employees before commending them for a job well done."
bad,Lacks fairness when it comes to advancement opportunities at certain locations. If you are not liked  by management you will not be given the opportunity to advance.
bad,"The pay is well, but there truly do care for the way they treat the workers, especially if you leave and have to have them fill out a form, plus management does not set an example at all, when it comes to being management."
bad,"management do not seem to care about their workers, or the issues they have, they Are VERY pushy on offering Warranty even after customer declines, the co workers are amazing other than managers, Supervisors are very understanding and flexable to your schedule"
bad,It was lot of fun making the food. I enjoyed the job very much. I learned a lot about the food industry. I was a good first job.
bad,"Wasn't expect to be the way it was, it was always an schedule conflict. was never gettting hours, and it wasn't fair. managers cared for themselves, never respected or gave you any compliments on your work ethics"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"As a CSR, I did inbound and outbound calls. I worked for Data Recovery, so I was responsible for customer confidential materials. I often had to perform data reviews over the phone with clients to verify their files were recovered by our Geek Squad Agents. I was also responsible for checking emails and voicemails and responding back to clients. When I had major health issues my management found work for me that met my limitations and were always supportive and showed concern for me during hard times. Being at work always felt like being with my second family."
bad,"If you want to get treated like less than a human and be expected to get pushed into the dirt, work here."
bad,"This is a highly micro managed place. I have a degree in electronics and the had car radio installers as management. The management was always against the employees. The production expectations were set very high because the ones setting the level had no clue what it took to trouble shoot to component level and complete a correct repair. They also did not know of the concept of burning in a product to insure the repair was done successful. The co-workers were great except a few people, but you get that anywhere you go. When work was slow they would send you home with no pat or make you use your vacation pay. The benefits were great, the pay was within the market avg. If you are looking to start your career as an electronic tech, do not go to the service center or any part of the geek squad. The just laid off all the real techs and are just having board swappers, Best buy is a bad place to work at."
bad,GARBAGE ACCEPT FOR BENEFITS. Never work for this company.You would have to work their to actually see what im talking about.Drama Drama Drama..
bad,Inventory is the worst deparment. Your job duties are endless and your pay is low
bad,"Good and Bad experience depending on direct managers"
bad,work at this job in high school left for better paying job. would go back
bad,Fixed computers on a daily basis. Geek Squad was fun to work for but the rest of best buy is shady and most of the management in my store was useless. Management changed every few months from people leaving/lay offs. Hardest part of the my job was nothing really I fixed computers and it was quite fun to do.
bad,Zero work/life balance.  You work 40 hours and it feels like 60.  The hours are terrible and you have to work every weekend.  The training is very poor
bad,The management expects you to be fake and they write up people every chance they get.
bad,Working at Best Buy wasn't my favorite place to work. Work days dragged by very slow with often encountering upset customers. The management was very pushy and micro managed everything. The other employees in the store were good people. A lot of people didn't have a great work ethic and didn't seem to enjoy helping customers but on a personal level they were good people.
bad,good beginner job for someone who has not had a job before but be aware of not getting used more than you have to. review your SOP. make sure you know what they can and cant make you do.
bad,Terrible and awful please do not apply here do yourself a favor and apply elsewhere as there is no room for advancement since most Mangers/ Supervisors at there location will probably work till they die there.
bad,"you get a ridiculous amount of pressure so sign people up for credit cards and protection plans. Its absolutely crazy how hard they try to make you push for that. Pay was just normal but its was ok at that point, however management is very unfair and play favorites."
bad,"Ive been with the company for 7 years now, and the work environment has gotten incredibly toxic and not cohesive to good work or an enjoyable employment."
bad,Although I am great for my time spent at Best Buy the biggest issue they have is being a non commissioned sales force. Basically Walmart for electronics. I’d never recommend this company based on those merits alone.
bad,"Was an overall good work environment to be in. They are on top of their first aid, and care about safety. But they don't care about any thing aside from performance. I ended up leaving because the workplace was to volatile for my anxiety from the HR. From the higher ups my anxiety had been triggered to the point of not being able to go to work, with them having known I suffer from severe anxiety. All of my numbers were above par, but I kept being pushed. Ultimately not a great place to work. Good filler if you're in between jobs, but I most definitely wouldn't want to seek a career here."
bad,"The environment within Best Buy can best be described as a commission environment without the commission. The amount of add ons and sales expectations are not that pressing in and of themselves, but the managment and leadership are as sales oriented as they can be despite there being no reasonable compensation for performance. It doesn't matter how well you do in sales, your compensation will be based on in-grouping and high school politics. The leadership in Best Buy as a corporation is a joke and beyond broken. WHile the work/life balance is arguably the best in the nation due to extreme flexibility considering it is retail, if you rub the wrong way a person in upper management, your life will be rough."
bad,not a great place for moving up in the company. the target sales are unrealistic maybe except for the weekends.  the co-workers are ok but management could use people skills
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"A typical day for me was working a department that was understaffed and constantly busy. Sometimes I would be faced with going on my lunch break or skipping it for the sake of my co-worker's sanity."
bad,Clearwire was a huge learning experience for all things leadership and execution. It was very day to day and month to month but every month day counted
bad,"This company promotes on being the right Fit. After being turned down for numerous promotions, I was told performance doesn't matter. If someone is the right fit and under performing they will be promoted over someone who is a consistent rock star. I spent over 2 years with the company and will never go back."
bad,"Job description is nothing like what you are asked to do. Unrealistic tasks and time are given for you to complete. Management does not care about their employees and will gladly throw you under the bus just to make a sale. Micro managing is rampant, physically impossible tasks under time crunch, and lackluster leadership are a few of the reasons to avoid this place."
bad,Worst company to deal with in terms of Short term Dis. and keepng you records in check. They make you hassle customers and you only bonus if the whole store makes Rev. and is not based on sole engagement and workmanship\.
bad,"Quality of life , working thanksgiving, no holiday pay or comp days when working holidays. 6 day work weeks at 12 hours a day during thanksgiving and xmas week"
bad,"If you are someone who enjoys working under organized, fair managers, look elsewhere. the discounts and benefits are good but expect to be looked down on every day."
bad,"If you get in with the right people, your career at Best Buy can take you everywhere. If you baulk at any of the policies or advocate work like balance for your people, you black ball yourself. The money can be great but the family sacrifice is a serious one to consider."
bad,"Geek Squad is a good place to work if you would like to keep up with technology, however that is all its good for. There is a lot of favoritism there and the rules are almost never followed. However, when a new manager or GM is hired, then everyone tries to get their act together and starting giving out write up to the point of termination. Vacation is non-existent and there is no such thing as an excused absence. Even if your sick and have a doctor's note they will not excuse it. I was urinating blood at work and asked to leave to go to the hospital cause I suspected a kidney stone. Came back to work couple days later with hospital notes and discharge papers and was still written up. I can safely say that it all depends on who the GM is, that is how you can expect the place to be managed."
bad,Learned about new technology was able to use my skills to provide assistance to clients and customers. Completed a number of transactions with returns and exchanges in a courteous manner while learning more about each customer. Completed multiple tasks to get my duties done in a timely manner. Learned how to enhance my problem solving skills by working one on one with customers resolving difficult issues.
bad,I do not have enough time to write out all of the negatives I experienced working here. I was able to obtain my degree while employed here and moved on shortly after completing that.
bad,"For your information, be expected to come into work and be asked to do everything that is not listed in the job criteria. I will admit that they had a great management team there prior to their current management staff and reorg. If you need a manager for an overide, which you will need to, a lot, then your gunna be waiting a while. This store became so depressing when their new leadership team took over. I've never before been more thankful since I got terminated from that place. Best Buy has some good managers, but they certainly aren't located at Clarence, NY. Day to day, people had constant complaints, got embarrassed in front of customers. I for one was following the corporate SOP and the manager says do it anyways. I pulled up the SOP and he still made me go against it. I used to be able to go above and beyond, and then they had changed the rules, and I could no longer go above and beyond the customers expectations. I had to stay in a 20x20 area, not allowed to leave that area. So if someone came up to me and said I wanted to exchange this, I could not go and grab them the item. I had to tell them what the item looked like, and that they had to go get it themselves. I would then try and get someone else to get it, but everyone else was too busy with other customers. The customers ended up getting confused and frustrated. My position got constantly downgraded, due to the restructure. I got gypped on my annual review and got a raise that really wasn't worth anything. You would think that a company that values their employees would value them a little better? The only thing"
bad,"Everyday I activate phones make sure that all of my customers are satisfied before leaving the store. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing the smiles on my customers face once they have gotten their new phone. The hardest part of my job is getting activation thart takes more than the usual, but working hard and being determined makes things a lot better in the work place."
bad,"Best buy is all about politics its who you suck up to more to get ahead."
bad,"Its a very up beat place to work."
bad,"Answer phones,describe and recommend products, offer protection plans,complete sales over the phone."
bad,"The B2B division is in disarray, lacking clear direction. Huge uncertainty especially in light of overall business challenges with acquisition , declining sales and rumors of layoffs. Often processes get in the way of solving customer issues and product availability is hampered as business sales take a back seat to retail sales. The division is struggling identifying what value it adds and what value added solutions it brings to market."
bad,"Applied as Electronic Product tester, ended up working in the wrong department, Parts Harvesting. Took me few weeks to understand a whole completely different procedure, Staff was very irresponsible not setting up my Kronos hours, which led to mild frustration on them, did not walkthrough with the training, did not provide any standard operating procedure for IMPORTANT duties, did not provide any feedback on progress. Most of all, did not set up the workstation with server name, login and periphals. I had to take the trouble setting it up for myself.. All of a sudden closed the contract and asked me to leave. I was very dissapointed and will not recommend anybody to work in the Brampton Distribution centre. None of these people take responsibility for their actions. But other than that, food in the cafeteria was awesome, it felt like a good place to be.. I hope you donot join this location because you can be asked to leave any moment and suffer in this stubborn job economy."
bad,"Yes there is advancement, if you are on the right team. The sales floor team, AMAZING! I love them, they are what makes best buy great. I loved working there and hated it just as much because of management. Cruel, cruel as they get. Young and running a muck until corporate shows up."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,When I first started it was going good everyone was cool until they stopped putting me on the schedule and then terminated me for no reason. Wasn’t even told that I didn’t work there anymore and when I asked if I was seasonal they told me that I was regular part time but wasn’t put on the schedule for almost two whole months until they terminated me.
bad,"Management is horrible."
bad,"Nothing to say here , anything I could/would say is detrimental to the companies reputation therefore i will refrain from any review. Only inserting this so the system will allow me to proceed."
bad,"Regardless of any good aspects of the job--your position and job security is never guaranteed. The Best Buy I worked at for over a year fired 10 people all last week and claimed some ""head count"" issue mandated by the company. Two days later they were hiring new staff for positions that were vacated."
bad,I think they over estimated how many people they would need and didn't get the orders they had hoped for. So they let us all go 5 days before Christmas.
bad,"good job for people doing part time. Management can care less about you . My new manager ( becuase i moved to  a different store) desserted me when we were supposed to be doing our training together. I felt worthless. When Christmas came around all employees were given a card and money in an envelope except for me, I was only given a card and no money, which is undoubtedly discrimination/ racism"
bad,I like Best Buy the Hours was good the pay was great but you have NO time to be with your family you work every holiday except Christmas. If your a mom morning shift would be best. I work nights and it’s really hard.
bad,Working in management was terrible long hours with no overtime and constantly trying to please the district management.  The company was always restructuring and cutting positions.
bad,"Best Buy is a good place to work if you're going to school on the side, or you just need a temporary job to start making money right away.  Working at Best Buy as career would be a bad choice, because it is hard to move from entry level positions into management, and if you're lucky enough to get promoted to manager, you won't be seeing your family very often.  The money isn't worth it, and ripping off customers on OVER-marked up accessories gets old.  I would recommend doing something that contributes more to society.  Not a corporation that only worries about sales and not people."
bad,"Very slow, resists change, does not understand digital and very ineffective. Great candidate for a PE firm to buy and fix. "
bad,Unfair pay throughout the company. Unequal bonuses and incentives between departments. Childish and unprofessional management. Poor expectations going forward for the survival of the corporation.
bad,"Worked at Distrbution Center for over 3 years pay was good people I worked with wonderful.  Management and company the  definition of hypocritical.  Preached  "" Living the Values"" only to find out the company had none.  Found ways to get rid of LOYAL HARD WORKING employees who had worked hard to replace them with new employees at lower pay."
bad,"Managers are always telling workers they do a terrible job and need to get better. And this is not just me, this is every single employee in the entire store complaining about the same thing."
bad,"Call Center Management is for themselves, they don't listen to their employees and keep up a lot of drama. It's always something at DDC 728.  If management don't like you they will get you out of there. I work load is easy and wearhouse team is great.  Pay is wonderful but insurance sucks. This place is no where to build a career!"
bad,"I was assigned as a third party consultant to assist the Geek Squad Home theater agents with installing home theater equipment. Why Geek Squad hires third party agents from temp agencies still boggles the mind, because third party consultants are nothing more than step and go step and fetch it lackey's for GS agents that are unorganized with time management and technical skills. "
bad,"My co-workers were sweet, I enjoyed getting to know them. I could only work Friday-Monday (the busiest days) so my time there was chaotic. I learned a lot, I learned that you learn the most from teaching yourself."
bad,i worked my work way up from a sensonal part timer to a mobile installtions senior within 2 1/2 years but when i got the job getiing my full pay was help. they tried to start me off at $10.31 and that wasnt in the pay band so i didnt get my title until later on when they up my pay a little bit. It still wasnt enough for my experince.
bad,The managers is what makes the Job boring and very stressful. You deal with customers all day long which for me was not difficult at all. The quotas is what makes it difficult because sometimes what they ask for is unreasonable and unnecessary.
bad,Both my sibling and I have problems here. Not a good place to work. They are unorganized and messy. Management is horrid as well. Not a place to work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"If you are looking for job security, this is not the place to apply. Multiple people were fired from there positions with no valid reasons and were lied to about why."
bad,I went to bestbuy because they had the seasonal hiring event and did not get the job based on an assessment and wasted my gas to hear that I would not be interviewed because of the results of a dumb assessment.  This is bad business and no one should have to be judged on an assessment to be hired.  The assessment are a waste of time. They could have called me to tell me that I would not be moving forward with the interview instead of me wasting gas to go and be turned down  I will never shop in Best Buy ever again.
bad,the only way to climb the ladder is to screw someone that in a higher position can’t Manage their way out of a paper bag that’s wet there not even 500
bad,"I currently work at Bestbuy and it is my main source of income. Best Buy  is a good company if you are young, and the starting wage is fair. Bestbuy is always hiring part time and full time."
bad,Good company to work if you want a part time. The only thing I really I hated is working on Black Friday I could enjoy thanksgiving with my family because the company wanted to make money and hit their goal which every year they never do.
bad,"It was a hard job because I had to stand 8-12 hours at the door, most of the time I couldn't take lunch during my shift because no one will cover me. Plus some employees never respect me like sales associate leaders. They offended me a lot. That's why I decided to quit."
bad,working at best buy was an interesting experience for me... it allowed me to work on my people skills and customer service skills but it was a hassle dealing with managers and supervisors about sales quota's
bad,"a typical day at work can be easy if the management hired the right people for the job. work place culture was great and the people you worked with became friends and family, but overall the job wasn't the best."
bad,it was fun and family was big thing time spent there was very nice and it was a great time just showing up to work to get everything done no stress at all
bad,"The environment to work there is great. Everyone is nice and you learn a lot of things while working there but the management is made of people with ice cold hearts. When they hired me, they hired me as a full-time employee and on 90 day probation.Everything was fine, there were no customer complaints against me. But after the boxing day passed, they started laying off employees. On Jan 29, it was my 90th day of probation and they fired me that day for no reason. Since, I was still on probation, I could not do anything about it. I walked into new year jobless. They fired 90% of the new hires for no reason. If they needed us just for 90 days, they could have just told us that. I would never recommend any of my friends or any living human being to work there."
bad,"If the company is hiring any advanced positions, it does not matter how suited you are for the position or how great your yearly reviews are, the company will hire whoever they know and like the most, whether they are suited for the position or not"
bad,"Bad experience here in Az. Had an  nice time with company in Boston. But here in Az was awful .  Honestly I think my GM was awful  and that goes for the OPS Manager also,"
bad,"Great management team and excellent benefits, but the salaries are low. The company is growing like crazy right now, so employees were told that there would be new opportunities available to support the increase in business."
bad,The money is good but after your hired you don't exist!! The new hire process sucks and so does mgmt. You do your e training in the mgmt office and get constantly thrown out left to wander around the store for hours. No one knows who you are or what you have to do. Mgmt and their new hire process SUCK at this store!!!
bad,"Product Process Manager - Best Buy"
bad,"First store i worked at was absolutely amazing, great people and amazing managers. I transferred about 5 months ago, and the whole company got restructured. For the worse might I add. No help from managers, all they care about is numbers. They don't want you to quit but they'll push you to your limit."
bad,Compensation is ridiculously low. Micro-management environment. It is a total scam.
bad,Horrible compensation for Account Managers. It continues to change and they leave their employees in the dark.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,It's a fun place to work with lots of new technology always rolling thru. They have average employee benefits and discounts. The upper management is horrible and does not really care about the average worker.
bad,I still have nightmares that I'm working at this job. They really need to have more employees for how busy it gets. I got cussed at by customers on a regular basis and I can't say I blame them. We had days go buy without anyone scheduled to fix any computers but was told we need to quote a 2 day repair time. Even though our average was 5 days. Needless to say customers were not happy.
bad,"I worked at Best Buy twice as a temp through Elwood Staffing. I was laid off the first time after a month, and terminated the second time after a month again. Best Buy is divided into two sections, PRC and DotCom. PRC has great hours 7:00am-3:00pm but it’s highly physical if you’re doing put away, lifting up to 100lbs every few minutes. DotCom has terrible hours 8:00am-6:30pm with the chance of staying late. Both sections are extremely hot with no AC and have very little work to keep everyone busy and will VTO 80% of the time so everyone gets laid off or terminated. Some people have been there for over two years waiting on a full time position to open up. Coworkers on first shift will tell on you for cursing or simply saying you’re frustrated so be careful who you talk to or around. Managers in PRC are very friendly but the managers in DotCom are rude. Very short break times in both. 10 minuet breaks, 15 if the heat index is over 90 degrees. 20 minuet lunch."
bad,"Its okay. Nothing special. The problem is they want to you work your fingers to the bone and barely pay anything. Unfortunately, finding a decent job is difficult. Even as a veteran............"
bad,Great company to work for. Employees were very helpful and polite. Management could show a little more encouragement to employees.
bad,"This is my 2nd time working for Best Buy and there is no room for advancement whatsoever. New hires would be getting paid 2 to 3 dollars higher than other people who had been working there for years. Also a lack of hours throughout the entire store because some supervisors display favoritism intentionally. If anyone wants to advance in the company, the general manager will deny your request without even interviewing you for it and pull someone from out of store who has to be trained."
bad,"A typical day at work was getting harped at by management to add Geek Squad Protection... they actually convinced most of the other associates to give a care where I couldn't care less if they took it or not... it's not like there would have been any reward in it for ME, only for Best Buy."
bad,"DO NOT WORK THERE! Racial profiling is real! The bashing towards African Americans there is so real! Not only do they make hair jokes, they also single people from different races out of the team!"
bad,"The worst thing about BB is the management.  I worked in over 20 stores in 3 years.  Management usually doesn't care about employees.  The day at work changed from day to day, and management changed very often. Just show up for work, continue working on your degree and once you graduate get out!"
bad,"The company can be demanding and not understanding when issues arise. Often, they preach that the teammates come first, but that is not actually put into practice"
bad,I would NEVER work for FLORENCE. Any other location for Best Buy is fine. The Florence Management is terrible. You have to be on their side or else you’re done. That’s why I moved to Atlanta
bad,Did not like this company. I was never train on things that would help me perform my job duties. I would say working at a main location would be better.
bad,"Mala capacitación a sus líderes, la empresa es estadounidense pero opera como cualquier empresa mala de México, salarios bajos en general."
bad,Did not like working here and recently left. The coworkers were not honest. I also heard that the local geek squad was being investigated for fraud and poor performance.
bad,"The supervisors were very rude and treated you like an animal. They would constantly send me to different areas all the time, then would get mad at me for learning what to do after less than an hour of doing it. The days were very inconsistent, sometimes you would get 3 days even though at the orientation they said 5. All together this job was horrible"
bad,"Anyone on any level of management will have a built in dislike for other workers. Even if you've been sitting beside this newly minted manager for years. It's like a requirement for those who are promoted into the position: ""Those workers are not your friends. Our job as managers is to squeeze as much blood from them as we can while ensuring they return tomorrow."""
bad,"Lots of favoritism thru out the company instead of finding out the right talent."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Management at the Best Buy I worked at had a lot of favoritism. I worked hard while others slacked and they would make me feel like I wasn't good enough, They hounded you to sell sell sell. Until the stress was unbearable. I literally hated going to work. They never let me have a break EVER. And you could never leave on time. I'd always stay 30 mins to an hour after my shift. They really don't care about their employees. I literally walked out crying and quit because the managers told me i wasn't good enough and was at the ""bottom of the barrel"" (that was their exact words) It was not a good/healthy place to work and I would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"A good place to learn and get different role experiences  I got to work in I T  and home theater and also learn tv repair...… I did Home Theater installations then I was cross trained into PC repair and later I also repaired Tvs.  I did installs repair and trouble shoot all three, on a day to day."
bad,"Overall, so many people in the store are miserable. Most of my coworkers do not like working there, and it is understandable. It is not a good place to work."
bad,"Underpaid, over worked, extreme demand, no respect, and you are disposable. First opportunity they get to let someone go, dont be on the radar. Highest paid goes first."
bad,"If you get in thinking the management will allow you to develop, forget about it. They will make sure you are not given the chances that you need to receive."
bad,Hours would vary on your sales. Sales were non commissioned. Hourly pay. They would throw you into departments that you were not really qualified to be in which made it difficult to help customers properly.
bad,"I was a seasonal worker and had never worked with sales or retail before. The supervisor expected workers to automatically know the system. His girlfriend was 2nd in command and she was not nice at all. Any time i would make a mistake, instead of helping me, she would get frustrated and tell me to do something else. The management for my department was not very good at all. However, when i trained on the cash register up front, they were very helpful and friendly."
bad,Very boring good for an after school job probably would not go back the pay rate is OK good work environment dealing with a lot of different types of people
bad,"Great benefits for full time only, rare advancement opportunities where you need to ""know"" someone to get ahead.  Also, online support was outsourced to another country leaving 500 agents without jobs/"
bad,Most fixed could be found by simply looking them up on the internet. Extremely unprofessional and unnecessary.......................................................
bad,Management is terrible. Wages are low and benefits are not great. This is not a good place to work. Very stressful at times and management makes it worse.
bad,"I work there for a month and it was ok for the most part but I did not work there long enough to make an opinion of it. so there is not a lot to say, and the business when bust"
bad,"If you're in high school or college, this is a good place to get started.  But hard work is rewarded with more work and no money.  They pay very little compared to peoples skills and education."
bad,"Imagine being confined to a computer desk in a completely white room in the back of the store watching hours upon hours of ""training videos"" that with no form of hands on training were somehow meant to prepare you for working the sales floor during Black Friday, arguably Best  Buy's busiest time. After Black Friday, hours were drastically shortened, basically you were only being used during the busiest time despite promises of 20+ hours a week."
bad,Management will lie to you ... GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING!!!
bad,"I had a very poor experience working for this company. Both management and staff members were not kind, poor training, and a very negative work environment."
bad,"Best buy is not the best job in the world, they want you to ""Bleed Blue"" sorry but i have bigger dreams then best buy and that's something i don't think they understand"
bad,"High pressure, low paying big box retail store. Employees are required to meet demanding sales goals without any type of commission and a tiny incentive to get a bonus for management. Would not recommend."
bad,"Pay is too low. They will take advantage of your supposed free time, as well as require you to work insane hours for no extra pay. I wouldn't want my worst enemy working for this company."
bad,not a good work place. they don't really care about there employees. they use to care for everyone that worked for them but now all they care about is saving there self the money and cutting jobs!
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,work is easy as long as you keep up and pay attention to your surroundings. only con is that during season November to December you are required to come in at 4am.
bad,It was a good experience just wasn't the job for me . I learned a lot about the asset protection position filing paper work and most importantly the crazy things people try to get away with lol
bad,not a good company. not worth working for them. management is very unprofessional. long hours usually working by yourself.
bad,this is the worst job ever. they don't care about their employees at all they only care about the money. the run employees like slaves and into the ground
bad,Days at best buy were fun and unique. Days were different and the management is very accommodating to the staff at best buy.
bad,"The only positive side to the credit card was the financing, but it had a big consequences if you failed to make a payment on time. After speaking with some customers i learned the penalty fee is where the drawback is. Its free to sign up and use, and is heavily pushed to the consumer."
bad,hard to move up in the company if your not willing to kiss up to management. hour are decided by favorites instead of spreading them out evenly with the struggling part time employees. Currently they are hiring new employees yet claim to have no hours left to give to current employees who are struggling barley getting 12 hours a week
bad,"Its a good place for starting out, but dont think that you will get any where due to the fact that the higher management is clique."
bad,"Turnover rate is so high that they don't have time to train. So its practicing on the customer, which results in a poor experience for everyone. A very unhappy workplace from top to bottom."
bad,I worked about 11 hours on both Saturday & Sunday and I only received a 15 minute break. I was paid in cash and my first pay check wasn't even the right amount I was supposed to be paid for. The manager was very rude. All of these things made me quit within 2 weeks of working there.
bad,"I scan merchandise and package it into boxes making sure my packslip matches what I have and the label that I am putting on the box matches the packslip and merchandise.  The merchandise is then sent on the conveyor and goes to either UPS Ground, UPS Next Day, or via United States Postal Service. "
bad,"It's was a fun experience. Loved being able to have the employee discounts, and making some kind of money at a young age. But, I couldn't see myself working there for the rest of my life."
bad,"Worked with a few great people. Terrible management across the board. It was basically high school, except you got paid to be there. And not that well."
bad,"Great products, great co-workers. Management needs to be reconsidered."
bad,"This position was a typical retail sales position. The greatest benefit of the position was that it gave me a whole new respect for sales"
bad,Fun place to work but hard to get full time.  During a day I manage associates and make sure they are selling to customers based on company standards.
bad,"Productive, mainly interacting with the directly with the business to gathering requirements and work with development team"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I don't even want to talk about it, I would never tell anyone to work here."
bad,I sold care audio and provided excellent customer service.
bad,If you need a temp job to raise a bit of extra cash then this will work for you. They do not pay that well though so should only be considered a secondary job or temp job.
bad,"Now it may have just been me but I feel that this place is an awful place to work. There is no training, they offer you the world then throw you to the wolves. If you don't meet their quota you are gone in a couple of weeks. Their approval system is ridiculous causing the employees to have to pay out of their pocket to get deals approved."
bad,"Due to the fiscal situation and declining market share of the company, they have made several decisions to cut costs. These decisions, while understandable to a point, have both hurt the brand as well as hurt the overall morale of it's remaining employees."
bad,"worst management ever, the most inept GM i have evercome across and the weakest charactered person i have ever had the displeasure to work for"
bad,"Very poor management staff, underpaid employees, discrimination And harassment.. customer service is terrible. No training and no areas for growth"
bad,"I was hired on as a part-time employee, but after the holidays I was told that they hired me as seasonal and so I was laid off."
bad,"Horrible benefits, great co-workers, annoying customers"
bad,"coworkers were great, managment was poor and ineffective, learned alot about sales and electronics"
bad,High turnover in current market for this industry and this is a bad industry for the current market conditions.
bad,"A typical day for me as a training occasional seasonal worker was ""shadowing"" for six hours. I was not allowed to say a word because I was not ""Blue Shirt Certified"". The first day I spent sitting in a cramped hallway room going through a crazy amount of online training videos. Despite the fact that I have a bachelors bachelor's degree in a computer related field. Management did not care that the person that I was shadowing was throwing scissors and balancing on top of a stool on two legs. Honestly it was the worst experience I have ever had."
bad,"Best buy hires based off of business needs. Management does not care about there employees. At the DDC 78 in Bloomington, MN, management are not flexible with your schedule, but want you to be flexible."
bad,Sales driven company that excels on selling protection plan on it's merchandise.
bad,"Great environment but you will grow very quickly in the company."
bad,I worked for Best Buy 529 in Visalia as a lead autotech it was a good place to work but management dose not care about employees and they think all employees are replaceable and they won’t think twice to terminate people other then that the employees were awesome people to work with but no job security always have to feel like one error and they will terminate you
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for 2 years, in this time I had never been written up or talked about my work performance being poor. "
bad,this is a good first job for kids in high school pay is not very high but you do make tips it can be high paced at times so it will give you the training for a better job
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I worked in a couple departments and did good in them but management is so disconnected from the rest of the employees. They only notice or recognize the mistakes. No reward for all the hard work and very cliquey. No family vibes, everybody gossips and looks out for themselves. Rather than be helpful management just looks the other way until you’re not hitting your numbers then they try to coach you using unhelpful methods, and are not receptive to feedback"
bad,i worked for the company for 4 years and people who worked for less got paid more because management knew i would be too shy to ask for a raise or call them out for it
bad,"Im sure some Bestbuy stores are great to work at, however the one i worked at was a nightmare they would give manager positions to people without proper qualifications. overall horrible experience i would never go back to working there you are underpaid even if you have an extensive knowledge over your co workers, and you are expected to train on the the technical knowledge to the new hires while the ""manager"" plays games on their mobile device.....   one time i was working i had to explain why it was not appropriate to place a bundle of bananas on Dikembe Mutombo's picture that was place on the recycle bin ""to prevent compost from being placed in the receptacle. there are a ton of stories but overall im glad to be free from the stress."
bad,I worked here 5 years...I did the work of my supervisor for a year and a half while struggling to pay bills all while he got the pay for the work I did.
bad,"The managers were paid very well to delegate work onto others. The starting pay between 2 people that have the same job description and experience will be paid different wages, pay in very unfair. Customers are rude and will blame you for anything and everything."
bad,"fairly easy physical work and fair pay for the job description, wouldn't recommend working at this location unless you want to get swallowed up in drama (which is extremely hard to avoid when all the upper management is involved)"
bad,"It pays the bills while in school, nothing much else. Both the company and employees treat it as such. They will overwork the kids, pay them little, and replace them quickly."
bad,"Bad management, work like slaves for little to know Pay. The hours were very inconsistent and they cared nothing about work life balance. I would not recommend working unless you want the discount."
bad,At the time the job was just terrible. Best by had just laid off a bunch of workers and hired a few for near minimum wage and only gave out about 12 hours every other week because there budgets were cut.
bad,"sexist and ageist management"
bad,Used discretion when filing incident report. No longer work there. Moved on. Currently working in a more controlled environment with tighter security.
bad,"Not a place i would stay at too long, very hard to advance its all on who you know.  Great coworkers but management is horrible, overall id say its a great place for yojng people to work but mpst management is older and also come from other areas"
bad,Either you suck up to the supervisors for advancement in the company or you can just simply do your job right with hopes of recognition. Unless you play the politics with the management only then will you be considered for advancement in the company.
bad,"Dead end job with no chance for growth. Hours were terrible, they would ask you to go to their meetings and no one got anything out of it. I would say only get this job if you have to. The employees are only looking on how to make their commission."
bad,"Very poorly managed. I was told if there was an issue to find a cover for my shift and I did, had a a legitimate reason for not being able to work on 2 occasions which was all I had to call in for (didn;t have a babysitter for my children) was told it was ok, then written up for it at a later time. The problem came from poor communication from management, the general manager understood yet her second in command got to pull the strings and threatened to fire me, so I walked away, the stress and lack of pay was not worth the intimidation I personally received while there. On another note, I was one of several employees with visible tattoos and was the only one made to cover them up even though they are only design, no nudity or any kind of text, I felt very singled out and very unfairly treated because of this."
bad,"If you want to learn how not to run a business, wander around a Best Buy. The demos do not work, the employees don't care and the management avoids the sales floor, dwells on the numbers and is clueless on how to provide a welcoming customer environment. It's basically an endless rat maze experiment to make unobtainable promises to Wall Street. Once the 4th quarter results are announced it's cutbacks/dismissals  of the employees who know the most & make the most. High turnover due to lack of quality leadership."
bad,"This job is definitely for teenagers. They are severely unprofessional, they have favorites and you get put through the wringer if you're not a favorite."
bad,"No management support in making advancements in company."
bad,Customer interaction was terrible because of the expectations as they walk in.  The budget required to meet everyday and then potential for getting fired if you didn't meet those numbers was a horrible way to try and motivate employees. I was stuck at 9.50 for 3 years until they promoted me to Geek Squad. I tried applying to other positions within the company with never any success.
bad,"Travailleur de ""conseiller"" qui est plus un poste vendeur à la commission cacher. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,The pay is terrible unless you're part of the clique. The hours are just as bad. They'll work you to death when they need you but refuse to give you hours when you need them
bad,"no employee benefits, lack of engagement, no raises, no chances for advancement. no work life balance and no chances to see family around the holiday season. pay could be much better."
bad,I have learned a lot and grown from working at this company.  Work is steady and constantly changing.  I am able to learn new tasks and grow at this company.
bad,"in the beginning is was ok typical day was fast paced "
bad,"I love my position and what I am able to do for my customers. However, it is not a family friendly company. Managers and General managers are more concerned about how much they are benefiting from sale verses the morale of their employees."
bad,"Retail sales. drilled constantly and given multiple ""tests' threw the day. Both written and oral. no commission. hourly pay."
bad,The only good part of this job is the discount.  Corporate is so blind to what is actually needed and going on in the stores.  They have taken away most of the development that made this company great.
bad,It wasnt the dream job..All in all management was terrible and there wasnt any rom for growth. i suppose it is sufficient for that of a college student but other than that..
bad,You never knew if you were going to have a job the next day because of the increase of new employees for less pay. Managers were intimidating instead of motivating. Awful company to work for.
bad,"This place is straight up hardcore if your looking for a place where more is your only concern this place is perfect, otherwise look else where. I got two hernia working with them that kind i tell you how hard this is."
bad,I hated that we had to give up our holidays.  Best Buy is a job not a career.  There is no room for improvement unless you work there for 10+ years.
bad,Was only seasonal. Wasn't trained properly for the simple reason that i wasn't going to be there longer than the holiday season.
bad,if you like electronics and you need a job to just out you through school or a second job great do not a career out of this company they treat you like you are paper plates
bad,"Best Buy was a great company to work for, but not everyone appreciates their employees the way they claim to. There are certain leadership members who care, and certainly ones who do not. I learned many things about working in a retail environment and most of the facts I learned about all the electronics were done on my own, by my own curiosity by doing the learning they offered on different websites. My co-workers were all awesome and I gained many friendships that I still maintain to this day. The hardest part of the job is actually trying to make your way up into a company where you have members of leadership who do not support you in any way and do not help you. The most enjoyable part of my job was being over the community events and the employee engagement team. I met many people within our community, got to volunteer with many organizations, and always planned fun things for our employees to do outside of work. There is not really a ""typical"" day at work. This is not the ideal job for someone with a family, because your schedule will range at all sorts of hours. When you arrive at work, a member of leadership tells you what you the goal is for the day and what your department is responsible for. All throughout the day, the leaders are on the mics talking into your ears about revenue, comp, and how you need to contact customers and clean and bright. (all while they walk around with their binder and talking or texting on their cellphones) When people come in for their shifts, no information is transferred to them, except the fact that they need to sell, sell, sell to customers."
bad,"I worked at Best Buy for a year tooo long. The management had a different mission statement that I had. To focus on extra bells and whistles that do not benefiet the customer is wrong, and My mission statement was and is that the customer always comes first, not the employee!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,this place is possibly the worst job
bad,I enjoyed working there is the beginning but by the end at my actually store the environment was going down hill.
bad,Poor management at the Knightdale location. Very limited chances for advancement unless you are liked by the manager. All the ones that do advance are  basically just like the manger. You are either a 30 something white guy in leadership roles  or a Hispanic female. Manager uses threat tactics as a way of managing employees.
bad,almost exclusively part time. No real opportunity for internal advancement as the expectation is you have prior experience as a retail electronics manager. Little to no training. Constantly shifting sales goals that mirror commissioned sales expectations with no commission paid. Requires completely open availability. Don’t expect to be able to hold a second job and be employed here.
bad,"With the partnership of apple introduced many employees who are unhappy having to do three times more work while having the same pay. Going on the best buy and geek squad forums on Reddit should be more than enough to understand what the employees are feeling. The company is doing great sure but employees are unhappy and they are doing little to nothing besides giving us ""virtual high fives""."
bad,"People need to stop favoritism and learn to work as a team, you cant treat people that you do not like as a nothing. Best Buy was fun to work for in the beginning until that new manger arrived."
bad,"When I was first hired, I felt Best Buy would be a place from where I could retire. After an in-store management shift, everything I was promised was no longer given to me by new GM. Best Buy is a great place for a college student, or someone looking for temporary employment, however I can not reccommend the company for long term employment. HR is impossible to work with when you need help, and company WILL retaliate against employees who file a complaint against management"
bad,"They tell you they are watching out for you, as they put that knife in your back."
bad,"Do not go through a contractor, go through Best Buy directly. Their employees make $4/hr more, they are given breaks (non Best Buy employees are not), they get catering and events planned for them, they get benefits, they have more job security, they are guaranteed their hours and they are offered chances for advancement"
bad,"In short, love the employees. Great and fun employees to work with. Management needs a big overhaul. I am a divorced father who has a custody agreement to have my kids on the weekend. Unfortunately there isn't anything I can do about that at this point. I was told by my Sales Manager that he felt I had weekends off just to have weekends off to my face and that I needed to change my availability or go Part-Time for them to work with me. I pay child support so thats not able to happen. I also am put in a position to not have time with my kids so i can satisfy a job for 2 days. I have given Best Buy 4 years of my life and i loved working there. I never complained about my kids waiting for me in the car with my ex-wife in the rain, heat, snow or whatever. i had a life change and Best Buy is saying yes we understand but we cannot do anything about that."
bad,"Hard to move up in company because of too much competition and from people loosing jobs due to constant restructures. Low pay, they often tell employees they are replaceable. Have to work every Thanksgiving and cant be with family. They tell you not to put bad things when the annual surveys come up. Too much pressure to push credit cards and tech supports."
bad,Lots of favoritism and if you didn't kiss the managers but you were looked at very poorly management related to lots of workers workers related to management got away with a lot of stuff felt like a cult environment they made everything very very personal against individuals that had different views
bad,"Every so often when a new product would come out, and we would sometimes get the opportunity to try out the new products. This often was not okay, however, sometimes we were encouraged to try out these new devices. On those particular occasions, it was quite enjoyable."
bad,"Don't know how it is company wide, but management at my store was terrible once we got a new general manager. Only promoted outside candidates and often lied about different positions"
bad,Best Buy was great at first. hours are unreliable. new management is toxic and plays favorites/ boys club. yells at employees. would not recommend if you enjoy your sanity and self worth
bad,They act like you have the opportunity to move up but you don't. The management is terrible and the schedule was a mess and my manager made up rules to try and intimidate me. She was horrible. Ill never work for them again.
bad,"Been with the company 3 years, worked hard for the company. They don't really care about you. You're expendable. GeekSquad is about sales now. If you're looking to expand your I.T. knowledge this isn't the place. If you're new to I.T. this may be for you. Bestbuy as a whole is to me is a slowly sinking ship. So many changes but no pay to reflect the changes. Seen many people come in and out of bestbuy so many turnovers."
bad,"manager messed up my schedule and made it look like i missed more days than i did. even though the manager changed it on his, he did not on corporate schedule"
bad,"Always reworking other peoples mistakes, the pay is horrid and corporate is constantly throwing heavy workloads week after week with minimal hours.... there is no accountability held for people that are either constantly late, no call no shows, or when they do a ____ poor job.... the only way you will advance is if you have a twig and berries and that is if you are a huge brown noser.... they tell you they will work with you but never follow up on their ""promise"""
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Being employed at Best Buy was a learning experience and a couple of the supervisors strategically assigned me tasks due to the accuracy of my job performance, although, other employees were extremely fussy and picky about the functions and behaviors they wanted to participate in."
bad,Some people just ruin the job by not being team players. Most people are only concerned about themselves and not the team. Managers do not get their teams to help other departments.
bad,There was no real chance to move up in the company. The store I was at had the same management team for years. The environment there was a complete meds.
bad,Working at Best Buy long term feels like surviving the hunger games. Every quarter you face the fear of lay offs and elimination of positions. Zero job security.
bad,"This place could have been so good, but it was hamstrung by non-technical management and had a seriously bad habit of making people ""clopen,"" often multiple days in a row."
bad,"When Geek squad first started it was a great place that focused on providing an attractive salary & benefits to keep and retain their talent to help train the constant flood of new hires coming in.  They were very interested in you as the employee & your development long term.  Unfortunately the corporate culture has reared it's head.  The higher ups have slowly stripped benefits away from the line level employees up.  They have added unrealistic goals using 3rd party overseas labor as a comparison.  The immediate management was always great, but the regional on up are all in question on whether they care for the workers at the store level to the corporate level. When all of the experienced workers with more than 5 years experience in a division are laid off nationwide, questions are raised.  What is their loyalty to the workers getting them all their profits?  What is their growth model?  Long Term, this is not a place to stay long term unless you are sure you can deal with the regular corporate restructures and corporate/retail culture."
bad,"The second, at the risk of sounding cynical, is the ability to keep cool in the face of profound and offensive ignorance.  This is the single most useful skill I have learned in any job I have ever had, and that is a skill I learned at Geek Squad.  Technical skills can be learned in a theoretical setting; only praxis will make these skills intuitive, but they can be learned from a book.  Nothing in life will ever prepare you for having a client scream obscene accusations at the top of his lungs about conduct he alleges you to have committed with farm animals over something as mundane as a seven-year-old laptop having a bad hard drive, and once you learn to keep cool in the face of that kind of nonsensical behavior, you're on your way to remaining calm in any situation that might arise.  That is a genuine point of personal and professional growth that I am glad to have learned, and one of only a handful of positive things to have come out of this position."
bad,to much work to many hours not much help from managers or supervisors to stressful always working weekends and late scheduled every stressful to many employees calling in sick you end up working on your days off
bad,"It paid well for a retail job but I found the sales was very cutthroat at times. I would get threatened with my job if my department didn't meet goals and upsell people (it's retail, I get it) but I never found threatening job security to be useful to get employee's to work harder, only stress them out more. Black Fridays are always a guarantee and even though you would be scheduled for reasonable 9-10 hour shifts it would end up being 12 and then asked to come in four hours later after a promise to cater food fell through and breaks were sparse. If you can handle Black Friday, you'll be fine but personally, that one time of year and how management treated employees was not worth it for me."
bad,Competition is good but at Best Buy it was unhealthy and impeded on the operation of the business. Favoritism was an extreme issue that never went unchecked. It made working at Best Buy unbearable. Employees always felt under appreciated.
bad,i heard it has gotten a tad bit better but i would never work for them again. we shared desk. supervisor walked off the job when she was already late and the only one on duty. a lot of young people work there so its a very messy work environment
bad,"Management had no incentive to motivate workers, and thuis had poor morale. Employees' turnover rate was very high, and customer service was close to none. Very rigid structure where my offer to assist in other departments was discouraged."
bad,This is a job for people who live with there parents and want a discount on products no one else can benefit to my knowledge there 15-30 cent a year raise makes it so you can never get high above minimum wage and there excuse is it’s automated. All in all it was fun to get paid while not doing much but the hounding of having to add a credit card and insurance to every sale with no benefits to you plus the way your treated if you call hr was the last straw for me
bad,"In short, the harder you work the less they will compensate you. But the less you work the higher you will climb, which isn't far seeing no one leaves high positions."
bad,I worked in a specific department and was still asked by upper management to work in other depts that I knew nothing about. I had no knowledge about these depts and was still asked to upsell protection programs.
bad,"You have to work 18 hours a day, not a fun environment."
bad,"Best Buy as company is terrible, that have no protection of their employees there only interest is the higher managers. The Aventura location is a very sexist store, their a lot of women in managers role and they do not get along with strong alpha males. Be careful."
bad,"Different managers have completely different expectations, when policies change they don't notify you. The store manager at one point expected me to cover for a department that I was never trained in or have any experience and was frustrated when I was hesitant to go in inexperienced and mislead a customer. You seem to only be able to succeed if you kiss up to your boss, otherwise no matter how hard you work you'll never get recognized. I know this seems like common whining, but I've been in some kind of management position in 4 of the last 7 jobs I've worked, so I think my resume and experience speak for themselves eventhough best buy likes to treat their employees like they're totally incompetent yet rely on them to come in and cover shifts and train new staff despite this."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Weak management and inconsistent hours. As an asset protection specialist I felt like an afterthought. Company does not take the department seriously. If you want to coast and not have to really do your job this position is perfect. Otherwise don't work here!
bad,"This place is only worth working if you are in highscool or working part time."
bad,"When you have great customer skills, and computer skills, are hired to fix customer computers, but management is more worried about you getting out on the floor and pushing their pure-profit ""service plan"", and then teaching ways of never fixing things under this plan, without massive inconvenience to the customer, then I don't think it is a place anyone with actual skills will stay long."
bad,"in my specific location there is a lot of favoritism going on. 15 return policy is short and means we have to deal with A LOT of angry customers. The schedules i get, typically 1-9 , 4 days out of the week consume my whole day."
bad,The managers are not that great. You go into work and get asked to do more than what your job code is and get extremely underpaid for it. The managers like i said are the worst.
bad,"A typical work day would include, greeting customers and selling phones, phone products & mobile plans, setting up the right mobile plan for each individual customer and running credit checks. Restocking products and needing to have a flexible schedule."
bad,"Typical day of work consisted of driving and order selecting merchandise on forklifts. The only thing i learned was how to operate different types of forklifts, sit-downs, stand-ups, compression, bass-loid. Management was never out in warehouse. only supervisors. Workplace was very dusty and dirty and loud. Hardest part of the job was commuting to and from work , job was in Liverrmore and i lived in Modesto. I did not enjoy the commute. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience i endured in my knowledge of the different types of forklifts used to select merchandise and organize on docks ready to be loaded and shipped."
bad,"I started here in 2014 as a part time sales consultant while I attended university. I loved my coworkers and my first manager, however when the first manager left, he was replaced by a hyper aggressive manager who insisted on pushing certain products regardless of customer needs/wants."
bad,"Maybe it was just the store I worked at, but the management was terrible as well as the working environment. "
bad,"I didn't like the job much, Best Buy is numbers based, and setup as a commission structure with NO commission. Its like working with High School Kids"
bad,"This job has been okay, theres not much to do because its really quit and its only you in there so could get boring. This job was not flexible with my college hours. If i was ill they was reluctant on giving me time off. They found it hard to find staff."
bad,"Management sucked up there. They don't train you and thus feedyou to the sharks. Good luck.. Plus everyone up there is cut throat, they will do anything to get ahead of you. So watch out, but overall the job was easy besides the terrible, co workers."
bad,"A company that treats you like you're a salary based worker, without any of the benefits.  Demand way too much of your heart, soul and life to enjoy life.  Tuition assitance was nice, but capped at less than what half a semester costs at a major university."
bad,"The managers that were hired for this store had no prior experience in customer service or with management.  Most did not know how to handle their own department.  The management was lazy and always playing video games, hanging out in the break room, going on the internet all while getting paid by Best Buy.  I think that every employee should follow the rules, even managers."
bad,"Management plays favorites, raises are a joke or non existent, new hires get more money then you do you'll have to call HR to get anything done. Scheduling is a mess with  some part timers getting 10 hours a week while other part timers get 25+. Basically everything wrong with corp retail will be strong in Best Buy. Drilling sales expectations into your head lest you get fired while then preaching doing whats best for the customer. If you need a job, there are worst places to work but that's not a high bar."
bad,I learned a lot moving up the ranks in this company and am very grateful for the opportunities it has giving me but this is not at all a great place to work. There are alot of under pains and miss managed employee to begin with and more then i care to admit quick sales are put in the forefront of great service which is why there struggling now
bad,Did not like the way I was treated by management. I hire to be seasonal with definite possibility for full time. That changed quickly at the end of season. I was laid off.
bad,"Understandably this is not every BestBuy however the one that I worked for was possibly the worst work experience I have ever had.  The management had open competition and prided themselves on being mean, rude, and who could belittle the employees the most/best."
bad,Management does not support their employees. When I was unable to stay after my shift I would be told I needed the job because I was pregnant.I would have no coverage and would get my lunch/break the last hour of my shift. It made me I was being taking advantage of. Management has told employees that we no rights and they do not care about the employees only the sales. False promises are made as incentives. Schedules are changed last minute without notifying the employee. schedules are not ready on time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Seems as though all importance was placed on quantity of work instead of quality. Many customers were left unhappy as there computers did not get fixed properly the first time.
bad,"Excellent place to learn about advances in tv and computers.  However, not a great place for job advancement.  Overall, not a great place to start a career."
bad,Work life balance is non-existent. The company has continually stretch employees and leadership thin and have the tendency to restructure every 2-3 years.
bad,"Best Buy was not a very nice place to work.  The management at the 622 Broadway, NY, NY location is out of touch with the staff.  Theft and Loss of merchandise is a serious problem there.  Some manager's there have no sense of professionalism and do not reach out to train there staff yet expect them to meet quotas.  I wouldnt reccomend working with this company if you have intentions of growing from within."
bad,Management would always expect the employees' lives to revolve around the store needs. no consistency in schedule or weekly hours. poor training and unwilling to promote to full time.
bad,"Things started out well when I began work here on my college summer break, but by the end it was a disaster. My co-wrokers were great, but the district and store managers got to be awful. Raises were almost non-existent to the point where I told them ""they could keep the nickel per hour raise so we both knew where we stand""."
bad,Working on thanksgiving..... that blows. I hate this place. Lofty revenue per hour expectations. Crusty pay and no commission. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody
bad,"Company was new to this position which was seasonal (Christmas TIme) and did not exactly have all the quirks worked out.It was if I trained myself very little managment and no one to help you when its neccesary.Good pay ,good product.Just need better management and protocol."
bad,"Working for Best Buy feels like walking up hill, in a blizzard, while wearing lead shoes. It is not a great company to work for, and both the pay and chances of advancement are fairly nonexistent. They rely to heavily on the experienced workers to make things work without giving us enough payroll to allow the stores to have enough employees to help clients. If you are trying to find a job just after high school or if you are a retiree who is just doing this to not be bored, you might actually like working here, but if you are trying to make a career and money, you will be very disappointed. The store is management heavy, but it is like pulling teeth to make them come out and face clients. You will have to be able to work independently to work for this company. They are big about making sales numbers, and you will constantly hear a bunch of numbers that mean nothing to you. Keep in mind, you do not get extra money for making sales."
bad,"No Comments"
bad,"A lot of kids playing to be adults"
bad,Great as a part time job. Advancement difficult. General big box retail environment.
bad,Best Buy has some of the most talented people in the industry and fit has fumbled and lost so many great people.
bad,"The LRMG company which best buy is apart of offers minimum wage with harsh and restricting job work environment. The work culture is very poor, has a terrible work ethic and no training or benefits supplied."
bad,"For the longest time, I believed in the Core Values of Best Buy. I LOVED working for this company. This company is not right.. I should of got out sooner. I should of got out on my terms. Only thing I regret."
bad,good place to shop but not to work in my eyes they don't train their employees very well and i feel if they did i would still be there
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"If you’re aim is to learn how to interact with customers and learn the in’s and out’s of selling, this job will definitely help. There is heavy favoritism in this work environment higher than usual,  the brown noser’s advance. Management is terrible they only look after themselves ( most not all ) , loved working with co-workers and customers were also great! This company is really accommodating towards college students, if you have a family prepare to lose you’re weekends to this company. Also say goodbye to thanksgiving and prepare to work like a dog for Black Friday. The interactions with co workers and customers was the best part of the job, and management was the worst part the job ( discounts are a plus but not what they used to be )"
bad,"It's not a job for someone what is not people oriented. All they care about are sales and not about the employees mental health. If you're a people person, this is for you."
bad,"This job day by day started to drain your joy of anything you once loved.  I went into the job genuinely wanting to help others and explore new possibilities but through constant micromanagement and awful management, this job turned into a huge joke and something I wouldn't wish on anyone.  Very poor culture and pay for job expected."
bad,The management at Best Buy only cares about the money in their pockets. They will work their employees to death to make their bonus. No commission is offered. Only monthly bonuses which are a fraction of the amount that management gets. You must attend 7am Sunday morning meetings if you do not get enough credit card applications (which managers get bonuses for and sales associates don’t).
bad,"If you enjoy being promised full time, and then only getting 9 hours a week; this is the job for you. Management LOVES to favorite people that do not do their job, as well as the rules they make do not make sense what so ever. This is an okay job for high schoolers that do not have any bills to pay, but I would not suggest it for any adults with bills to pay because your hours will never be consistent."
bad,"It's very difficult to go to weddings, funerals, or child births working for this company without risking or being threatened with unemployment. I didn't see a thansgiving turkey or christmas tree or easter egg for 8 years."
bad,I’ve worked at 2 locations for just over 2 year  the way of being terminated was a very shady way about it hr barley helped nor had employee backs most hr cases don’t go any where very high goals/hr unrealistic goals for credit cards and always wants sales followed day of they changed bonus structure from monthly to quarterly never got full bonuses company truly needs help
bad,"No advancement, favoritism and not a good pay but pays more than other retails only with less hours like 12 a week, employees discount is good but management is horrible."
bad,"You are expected to sell products as if you are paid commission, but receive no commission. Your only extra compensation is a small bonus at the end of the month which you only receive if the entire store hits their revenue goals. Meanwhile the managers receive much larger bonuses, and put a lot of pressure on the sales staff so that they can receive their larger bonuses."
bad,"You work a sales based job with no commission and have no margin for missing very high sales goals.  The ""bonus"" that replaces your commission is very little, especially if you're not one of the few full timers."
bad,"Became cult-like, if you werent in the inner circle you didn't get hours or raises. Would not recommend unless it would be your first job. Not worth the headache."
bad,"This is an ok, starting job for a young person or retired person, if your mid career there is little advancement and too much stress for too little money."
bad,I first worked in the first building in repack. I did enjoy it. After contract was up supervisor wasnt honest about extending contract. Gave false hope. But  came back few weeks later worked in other building . Much better environment. Supervisor was the same as first boss had to deal with. Gave false hope again. They take advantage of seasonal employees.  They only keep certain people. They make favourites. Discount wasnt even worth the work.
bad,"The staff are all overworked and underpaid.  Unless you're in management and getting bonuses.  There is no commission for sales reps, which doesn't give them an incentive to ""be amazing"".  Too much pressure for sales staff to hit their numbers and unrealistic goals."
bad,"Stay away from working in GSC. no advancement, unrealistic expectation and really bad management, boys club culture, favoritism, very stressful work environment, no job security, and unfair performance reviews.  it change me to be a person that i hated."
bad,"The job requirements where fantastic, if compensated correlated to them. 10 dollars an hour and I had the sole responsibility of counting and reconciliation of all the stores inventory."
bad,"This place is slowly turning into a call center, and who knows how long that will last before it's shipped overseas. I would not be surprised if they eventually get rid of physical repairs within the next 2 or 3 years, or sooner. A massive layoff just happened, so they're replacing people with a lot of temps. Favouritism is an extreme issue within the facility. Many people, who have been there a long while, are lazy and worthless. We have people who come into to work just to sit on their butts and talk with their friends. Leadership doesn't care because they are doing the exact same thing. Also, you're going to run into a lot of people with massive egos, who think they're more important to the company than they actually are. Pay is ok, but not very competitive with other places. They reviewed our compensation within the last year, and instead of a pay raise, they decided to give higher bonuses when certain numbers are hit through the quarter. Funny thing is, is they knew business is slowing down and we have no chance of getting bonuses. I would not recommend working here if you're hoping to get hired on. As soon as business slows down, most temp positions will be eradicated..."
bad,"Its a zoo with multiple teams expected to figure out on their own who to work with, what to work with. There is a complete lack of co-ordination. Managers aren't respected so they don't bring that down to employees. Contractors are preferred so the only incentive to work is not to lose rather than to win and get promoted. Terrible culture."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,The people I worked with were so bent on Getting rid of stock the would tell People things that Weren't true about the product And try to up sale Every Item Rather than giving the member What they were looking for.
bad,"Management at Best Buy was absolutely horrendous. There was always a push to sell more or hit your target goals. There was nothing about customer service because meeting sales goals was far more important. If you made management look good than they'd be off your back. At my particular store, there was embezzlement and other things going on in back office but job security was on the line if anyone spoke out about it. It was fairly unfortunate to see colleagues left and right disappear or relocated during my employment. I would only recommend anyone in high school or starting in college to work here."
bad,Best Buy is retail. Plain and simple. You get it from both ends with no real hope of advancement and just always scraping by. Some great supervisors were overridden by incompetant management.
bad,"The management is extremely unfair, they pick favorites and it is evident. They do not try to hide it whatsoever. The pay is better than most retail jobs in the area, but the coworkers treat the place as if it is high school. They would rather come to work to spread drama and rumors rather than work. It is a toxic work environment and takes a toll on your everyday life."
bad,The discount received from Best Buy is phenomenal. The pay was terrible. Discriminated against for a promotion. Its just a place for a bunch of high school and college kids to socialize
bad,If you are looking for a full time shirt as an inventory specialist then Bestbuy isn't the place for you. The leadership I happened to work with were not very helpful at all when it came to training for advancement in the company.
bad,The environment was very cut throat... Alot of drama between employees and management and every day was like walking on ice with the managers. It was a lack of support and team work
bad,"They treat their employees as if they are commission based, when they are not at all. Which forces management to treat different departments unfairly."
bad,Your only opportunity for advancement in the local best buy is kissing the correct shoes. They ignore passion and true dedication for numbers when not considering the fact a salesman can't increase said numbers without having hours.
bad,"Even though I was a Merchandising specialist for only a month and so and it was during holidays so I understand that I would be working long hours and busting my butt, the managers never cared. They didn't work with you and would even sit in front of you and just relax than being an actual leader and help out so we can all go home and telling you that we need to hurry it up. It was just plain ridiculous. No one needs a sit and do nothing management team. We need leaders. Also, for 10$/hour, was not even worth it. Graveyard shifts are meant to be paid more because of the hours."
bad,"It is and okay place to work at best. Lots of double standards, and based on who likes you not if you are doing a good job. More than their fair share of unprofessional conduct."
bad,"I got the job as a part time. Not sure if the issue of poor management is for every store, but huge factor for my search of a new job.There was also lack of advancement when I would try to leave customer service to the sales floor I was never pursued and so were  a lot of others."
bad,"At Best Buy/Geek Squad as a Consultation Agent, due to current management, my typical day at work has been reduced to slightly more than customer service for computer returns. Current management has removed the computer repair/diagnostic aspect of the position and has left me to basically check computers in/out and to clean. Workplace culture is at an all time low due to the lack of workplace morale inspired by the management. Management has also cut our hours at Geek Squad to ~12 hours a week or less."
bad,"The job was alright. This was my 1st introduction into the world or Customer service. The first day I started was on Black Friday, busiest day of the year.  I feel like that experience prepared me for a lot within the customer service roll."
bad,"Not a career role. Little opportunity for advancement. Geek squad has a decent culture, but there is not much to speak of in terms of benefits and salary."
bad,"Rules change based on who tells them, I enjoy helping people and pleasing the customers that is why I stay. I don't fell like you HAVE to force a sale. If you please the customer, they will come back."
bad,"Simply to fill this box and move on to more important things at hand I will cut to the chase by simply saying that not every store offers a great experience. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Managers would forget to schedule you. I once went 2 months without any hours because my manager had forgotten I worked there! Pay was only 9 dollars an hour also.
bad,The managers at the Augusta  location have all received there positions based off of favoritism. Working there for five years I had the chance to see good mgrs. come and go because the top mgrs. in the location do not help fix anything. Request to improve issues in the store go unanswered.
bad,"Best Buy was my first job ever...and at first, I loved it. I loved the atmosphere and the idea that people came to me for help and suggestions. However, the training wasn't extensive at all. Most of your training is done on your own and by just going with it. Wasn't a pretty interesting way to go about things. And what sucked was that if your numbers (# of sales) were low, they'd get on your back. I thought it was unfair because they completely didn't put in much effort to train you. You shadow someone for two days, but before that, you're staring mindlessly at a computer screen for like 2-3 days. It's not the ideal place to work, but hey, for a first job, it wasn't that bad. The only benefit to working at Best Buy were my decent paychecks during the holidays. But, for the hourly that I had (11.50), the work load did not match the compensation. Only full-time employees received monthly metro cards, and I thought it was a little unfair. The hours always fluctuated. Some weeks, I'd work up to 40 hours, and then there would be weeks where I didn't have ANY hours. Literally, one time I only had hours because a good friend of mine that I made at Best Buy gave me one of his five hour shifts. That's the only reason I had a paycheck once. My advice to Best Buy: Properly train your employees. Don't just throw them out into the great beyond with NO product knowledge, and expect them to hit goals. It's absurd and setting someone up for failure."
bad,"The staff is friendly, management is ok. The hours are flexible for most, the job is more steered towards individuals just looking for extra income. Would not recommend to build career long term."
bad,if you work at Best Buy well the one I worked at was way too understaffed not to mention we were the only Best Buy in the city and they assume you know everything there is to know about electronics.
bad,There is definitely some gender discrimination against females that goes on at the GM/DM/TM levels. Favoritism and who you know also plays a big part.
bad,Best Buy was once a great company but in the recent times seems to have lost a step. The business model is outdated and needs changing with new and innovative thinking.
bad,There are no real incentives to become a better employee or advance your knowledge. The only focus is did you sell them a plan? Did you get them to buy the Geek Squad Protection Plan?
bad,"There is no opportunity for advancement in this position. You're job is to prevent theft; however, there is an outdated camera system and rules that prevent you from actually performing this duty, which basically leaves you as a glorified door greeter."
bad,"Company fails to balance hours to employees. Select few employees get 30 hours or more. 70 percent of employees do not receive benefits and receive 25 hours or less a week. 5 percent has been known to receive little as 8 hours a week. Starting pay is good but hours are not. Management has very little communication which makes paperwork processes slow. Overall, you have to stay on top of management in order to have an issue resolved, very little hours with no benefits besides great discounts, but the work culture among employees is a welcoming one."
bad,"it was good at the start but once you're exposed to the drama and politics of it all its so pretentious. like, you're selling tvs, chill. if you're scheduled until 9 you'll most likely be done by 930. the people the work there are great. i made lots of really good friends there. but some of the managers made work unbearable. there were poor decisions made when giving promotions and that cause the work experience to go down drastically."
bad,"being a cashier I did it well.I receive payment by cash and credit cards,issue receipts, refunds, credits or change due to customers.and count money before and after in my cash drawers.I want to work in a long time but it is a contractual job also."
bad,"we were sometimes legitimately told to lie to our customers in order to get them to sign up for credit cards. also, many times we were pressured into helping the geek squad with tech support when there weren't enough people to help. while i was happy to help customers with problems, i did not appreciate getting yelled at by management for providing solutions that didn't provide a direct profit to best buy immediately. perhaps that's why the store i worked at went under."
bad,Was usually pushed to perform tasks that were outside of pay grade and would get in trouble if not having completed all of the tasks that should normally be done by managers
bad,Started out decent. Business model and practices were not good.  Work life balance was horrible.  Every holiday and every weekend required.  Compensation was not competitive for the job expectations.
bad,Constantly on your butt to meet sales goals. Managers constant blame others for their problems. Many internal issues and the company as a whole seems to be falling apart slowly.
bad,"It is a great company to work for if you are someone just entering the workforce such as a student. A typical day is very slow but steady; not many customers unless it is a major holiday such as Thanksgiving or Christmas. The company's mission and goals are not reflected in the everyday culture due to the lack of leadership in management."
bad,"This company doesn't care for work. You could be lead sales for a full year and get a ""do better"" response. The work is a grind to keep up on all technology and you don't get compensated nearly enough for the knowledge you attain and the sales skills you implement."
bad,"Work hours are all over the place, very difficult to schedule family activities. Compensation is limited for the amount of knowledge and expertise that is expected."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I was working in geek squad with 6 others and we stayed very busy. working with others was fun and made it worth while. But the company was job out sourcing to India to fix viruses. So there were cut backs in hours and personal.
bad,The best buy that I worked at was not a good place to work due to it being like you were working commission and required to fulfill outrageous goals that didn't seem possible.
bad,"I like my job. I am a merchandise clerk at Best Buy. The job itself enlist of shipping and receiving product and down stocking. A typical day is price auditing, functionality checks of display products and Planogram setting. Planogram setting is making sure product is in the correct location with pricing the correct merchandising standards have been reached."
bad,It is an ok place to work they care all about numbers. all the want is money dont care about you at all. The work place is cool there are some mangers that a cool just like any job
bad,"Something happens to kids. They don't care. At time of hire was told they understand life happens. Had to call in once due to medical emergency with son, and they never let you live it down. "
bad,"Take advantage but expect no loyalty."
bad,Seasonal wise the job is decent there is only commission in the cellphone department. Hardest part of the job is probably lifting the biggest t.v's onto the carts or customer trucks the job was very easy and enjoyable.
bad,"If you want to work in a place where you will feel almost as faceless as working at Wal-mart than this is the place for you. Prepare to receive consistent, contrary instruction and have nonsensical propaganda shoved down your throat daily."
bad,"The management is horrible. Staff are whiny and entitled and lazy. The discount is great, but that's the only thing. Push credit cards on employees and sale quotas, but no commission."
bad,"Typical day consists of attempting to do one's duties with little support from leadership or a lack of follow-up. Management gives lip service to career plans and advancement, but takes very little to no actual action or direction to helping achieve those goals. There is barley any positive reinforcement for desired behaviors but leadership is quick to point out and obsess over even the smallest mistakes or the smallest dip in performance. This creates a toxic culture where even associates are so beat down that they don't show respect to their peers outside of their own departments and constantly fight among themselves and blame each other when things don't run smoothly (and they usually don't). Rewards are only ever given to sales people and there are no reward and recognition programs for the sales-support/operations team(s)."
bad,there were dailey learnings that needed to be done each day and the managers were always on us if we didnt sale anything. it just was not fun working here
bad,"It's a fun place where fun and communication is encouraged as well as hard work. My favorite part is talking to a customer and listening to a problem they may have and offering the perfect solution for them. It's a great feeling to know a person is walking away happy to have found exactly what they needed. Being part of Best Buy is great, the only issue I have is lack of hours."
bad,"Fun, young people work there on the ground level with an often interesting subject matter, but a disconnect between management and corporate can create awkward tensions for all. Too much turnover to create a strong workforce. ""Faking it"" and outright lying to customers is all too real in Best Buy and unfortunately an accepted part of the process. Pay is low. Lacks comprehensive and understood structure of other Fortune 500 companies. Discount is mostly only good on accessories. Impossible to create a stable life around working sporadic hours ranging from early morning to late night day by day. Open availability is almost required to be accepted and it is improbable to have adjustments created after the fact. My coworker has cancer and has struggled to get days off for his chemo."
bad,"A typical day at work at Bestbuy is going to downstock products due to short traffic of customers coming to the store. I've learned that there are other things to do when we are short of customers like printing price tags, restocking items on shelves and pegs, and making sure the department is clean at all time. Management at my current job needs works. They need to taking into workers opinions more rather than just care about making money and selling. Some of my co-workers are lazy and don't want to do the tasks at hand. I need to find a workplace were everyone on my team enjoys working and management is their to help us in good or bad time. The hardest part of my job is coming to work knowing that I have to pick up the slack. Taking care of others people job is not my prefer method but it makes time fly by. I like to keep busy then just stand all day doing nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing impartial knowledge in order to help customers solve their needs and give them a solution. That brings me some much joy when I can give people advice for their problems."
bad,"A typical day at work, begins with very high and demanding sales expectations, with no commission. Management constantly reminds you that your job can and will be lost if aggressive sales goals are not met."
bad,A great way to network and gain costumers experience. I've how to speck with confidence. Trying to keep with numbers. Sell more computers
bad,"Benefits are the only slightly redeemable aspect of the job, and they are only for full time employees. Deductibles and copays are still way too high to make them worth it in anything other than the worst case medical scenarios. "
bad,"Working at Best Buy was just a temporary job for me but overall wasn't worth it. Its run like a commission based sales company and sales employees like myself were forced to try and push geek squad, products and other services on customers. Meanwhile we were just getting our measly hourly wage.  When seeing ""expert service unbeatable price""  on so many ads its definitely misleading customers who come to Best Buy. "
bad,"Horrible management and team members filled with controversy and fighting. The company does not have a set clear future, they repeat the same things every year to no gain."
bad,"I worked for bestbuy for four years and couldn't be happier to leave... They do a horrible job training, and the managers are full of drama and they are lazy. I do not recommend working at bestbuy, they do not support you. Especially when are sick, they give you grieve for calling in and if you do not have someone to cover your shift you get written up."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,It was very simple working at Geek Squad. They are too heavily focused on making a sale rather than actually helping. Will work you to death if you let them.
bad,"Desperately over due for secret Shoppers. I mentioned on numerous occasions employees being rude to customers, lying about product we had in back. "
bad,"Work Daily stock counts provided by the company and report the losses back to the company, leadership and line level employees. Research missing product, communicate and train employees on shrink knowledge."
bad,they lose interest when you have worked for multiple years. they care about you when they do not have to pay you more money.
bad,"Unload containers using hand trucks, knowing the count of each product and making sure it matches the amount in the manifest, pull orders, do carry-outs, up-stock/down-stock sales floor, organize warehouse department."
bad,i gained costumer service skills and knowledge on all electronics. learned a lot about shipping orders and installation skills
bad,"This store is in complete disaray. The location is bad, the people that come into the store are really bad. I had to learn how to handle drug addicts, it was quite terrible. I would never work here again."
bad,Not a career move. All holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas. Working with teenagers that may or may not show for work.
bad,"The environment is always tense, the managers enjoy ganging up if you do something wrong, and they also enjoy harassing their employees. The coworkers are catty and have horrible attitudes. I do NOT recommend working here, as I was treated very poorly and so is all of the other workers. Don't let them pull you in with the good pay and hours; they WILL work you to death and hassle you for calling out."
bad,"With little to no room for advancement for most employees, Best Buy can definitely be a dead-end job. While I was able to advance, the corporate culture was horrendous. Management was terrible, and depended primarily on harassment and intimidation. Aside from that, the pay was terrible, and the hours were never consistent for most people. As a supervisor I was encouraged by management to juggle and manipulate people's schedules as often as possible, with the exception of a few, favored people. This corporate culture went above my store (which was shut down) and on up into our divisional management, as well."
bad,"Typical day at working in the warehouse at best buy is processing online orders. Doing carryout of large TVs. Receiving drop shipment from various sources like UPS, FedEx ect."
bad,"cold when off loading using walkies, manual labour of breakdowns,seems team leaders were fired and some moved in that need more coaching, some good co-workers"
bad,"Boring work with boring and petty management, no room for advancement unless you stayed at the company for upwards of 8+ years (lol) or were outlandishly qualified. (MBA, 8+ years experience, and new the store manager.) "
bad,"First off, horrible pay and high expectations. If you start getting towards the possibility of being promoted, they will find a way to fire you. I would strongly advise anyone and everyone to stay far away."
bad,"Not a fun place to work. Did learn some loss prevention procedures. Hardest part of the job, preventing stores shrink, trying to watch everyone on four cameras"
bad,"There is high expectations but no give back at all."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,It was a good job. I was  very young and was happy with working in an electronic store.
bad,"Management is a mess, but the co-workers were great."
bad,"Management gossiped all the time, as well as employees. Met a few people that were cool. Managers hound you through the walkies to talk to customers that 6 other employees already attempted to do. Stresses about sale, sale, sale! On top of most of us being college students they wanted me to learn way too much in a short amount of time. After a month of working here I began to look else where. I only lasted 6 months, that was 6 months too long. Do it for seasonal and then leave! I dreaded every work day. BTW, you hardly get any breaks at all, only if they have ""time"" for you to go."
bad,"Avoid. It's a retail job that pushes credit cards on customers. Company does not care about their customers, only bottom line."
bad,Bestbuy secondary market expects you to produce a large quantity of work.  They are never happy with your production even when you meet your goals.  This causes an individual to make errors and in the end the errors will cause them to terminate you.  This company has poor leaders that lack professional qualities.  I do not recomment working at this company for long or at all.
bad,"Too much work, not enough pay. Management pushes things customers don't want. "
bad,"Not a great place to work.  Management does not care about your life, even if you are the best worker.  They will over work and under pay you"
bad,"Terrible place to work now.  It's a trickle down effect.  Corporate puts the pressure on territory, territory puts unreasonable pressure on district, district puts unreasonable pressure on store GM's, etc etc."
bad,"Helping customers, poor management, lack of hours, co-workers were not willing to help train."
bad,I am an Army wife. My husband had to have spine surgery and shoulder surgery due to service related injuries. I asked for time off and they would not excuse any of the time I needed off for it. They gave me a very hard time about it.
bad,"Typical day? Well for me there was no typical day, you see while we had our own departments they added a new business model that made it so we had less people on the clock at a time, and thus one department would maintain up to 4 departments. With no training, and with little to no back up from the management. As a part timer there I worked 40+ hours per week with no benefits. I needed the money, and they kept promising me full time so I stayed with it as long as I could."
bad,"A typical day would involve getting in early, doing the jobs of those who called off or didn't show, while explaining to the management my reasoning for carrying multiple responsibilities--this was usually followed by managers complaining about employees (like me).--My co-workers did their best but lack of training and pay incentive made for a very lackluster sales environment."
bad,"A typical day at best buy starts with a morning meeting, some sort of ice breaker for the staff and then everyone heads to their respective departments. I did learn a lot about electronics and computers."
bad,"very NIT-PICKY about EVERYTHING...i HATED working there.,.very STRESSFUL..."
bad,"Aaswering phone calls from online shoppers and entering orders. Leanred a lot about products and services. Management was very bad. Managers were very unorganized and the training was awful. My co workers were very helpful and worked as team players. Hardest part of the job was training, most enjoyble part of the job was learning about the features and benifits of the products."
bad,"I was a seasonal associate and while it was a good way to make ends meet in the holiday time, I wouldn't recommend it as a serious job. While you could sell everything they could ask you too, it was never enough. Especially for a place that offers no form of commission or adequate wage."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,A bunch of young people playing dress up. Pay was so low that people couldn't afford the health insurance!
bad,"The company would be a good place to work if the leadership teams communicated to eachother better. There was no sense of urgency at any time in any department. The only bright spot of working there was the people you were working with, but with the constant state of wondering if you will have a job the next day due to lay offs, it is a bad work place."
bad,"Managers have their favorites and only those favorites get to advance, if you're not buddy buddy with a manager there is no chance for advancement. It baffles me that they have gotten to the position they have. The general manager is way to passive and leaves the decision making completely up to the only female manager for whatever reason whose only intent is making herself look better than anyone else. The only thing i truly like about working here is the co-workers, granted there are the good and the bad workers but for the most part that's it."
bad,this job was ok for someone entering the IT field for the first time. But after that the experience goes down hill.
bad,"A once promising, leading consumer electronics company that has chosen to rely on old, outdated management practices and rest on successes of the past. Micro-managed now due to a sense of blind obedience to these management practices preached at top levels and embraced like a life-line by middle and lower management."
bad,Working in sales
bad,If you get along with your supervisor/manager and are very close to them you are more likely to advance and not get in trouble for the inappropriate things you do.
bad,"Half the people working here have no brain and sit around playing video games all day. I am service oriented, and what went on here disgusted me. I wanted no part of it. I would not put my reputation and sales ability to waste here. If you're 17 and have no life, this is the place for you.."
bad,All this place cares about is metrics. Most calls get transferred from the stores because they don’t answer their phones. Majority of new hires quit within  a month of getting out of training. Certain call center treated lower than corporate headquarters reps. Only benefit is the actual benefits.
bad,Management at specific location wasn't adept at providing a healthy work-life balance due to consistent turn over of employees requiring the employees that did stay to work additional hours and come in on days off often. Promotions seldom came from within the store.
bad,If you’re a teenager and are looking to get into sales. Best Buy is a solid company to work for. You’ll learn how to speak and interact with people and how to sell properly. But once you get that hang of it get out and find a sales job where you’ll make actual money.
bad,It was a great place to work. I was able to advance. But then my position was outsourced and I got a schedule that felt like my live was on hold.   The also cut bonuses and made them impossible to obtain.
bad,"This was a frustrating place to work. "
bad,"I really have nothing of value to say about Best Buy. I did not enjoy working there. I came in with a Computer Science degree, inquiring about a Geek Squad position and they put me on seasonal inventory, teased a chance at becoming permanent, then functionally ghosted me after Black Friday. Didn't fire me; just stopped putting me on the schedule. I inquired multiple times about whether I should seek new employment and was given the run-around. I only got a letter mentioning that my seasonal employment was over a full month after I'd started work at a new place."
bad,"Hardly ever got enough hours to live on.  Hardly anything for people to buy anymore. Very top-heavy company.  Heavily play favourites with young staff who don't know much. Zero regard for people with families, know-how, or ability to sell.  I don't know how they're still in business."
bad,"Current management team is always in the management hub playing pokemon. "
bad,Moved up the ranks over the years. Others got promoted as they were friends of management (drinking hobbies) etc. Those who should be promoted aren't. Beware of GMs in the store as they will become best friends with other managers. Hold one manager accountable and the whole company will fold in and suffocate you out. Hr will not help as they are in bed with the rest of the team .
bad,"The local and district managers were more about sales figures than people, which can be typical for retail. They get so involveded that they lose track of who their best workers are and who does poorly.  Coaching and performance reviews are sketchy if at all. Current Manager obviously has little or no formal Management training. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for about 8 years, in three locations it was decent place to work but the benefits, pay, and possibility for advancement were not that great.  I liked working for them but I did not feel though there pay structure nor there time off was very good or very competitive as well as there ability to work with you if you had a major life event."
bad,If you are a hard worker and focus on getting all your tasks done in a timly manner with no help. You will still be over looked compared to the person who passes their work onto others and only focuses on what making their relation with the managers better!
bad,"This company pays well but they do not care about the employees nor the customers.  Calling grading is unrealistic and metrics are unrealistic. I worked at a credit card fraud call center and they were not as strict on metrics. The store employees are lazy and send everyone to the call center number for stuff that can be done in store. They want you to case and verify every call even if the person does not have an acct and just needs info on an item, just so they can trace what they are trying to buy so can make more sales. And if the cust does not want to give info you get dinged on your metrics. They definately do not care about senior employees at all in the three years been there. Shift bids are done on unrealistic metrics so a new person just here 4 months may get better shift than senior one there 3 years. Some supervisor's are great others don't care about nothing but themselves. Personally would not work here unless desperate and don't have no family life. If you sign up for company sponsored events you still have to work your hours or miss the event. 3 years is all I could take."
bad,"Not a promising place to work. Any time you can loose your job. No work guarantee. It's good for students to make extra .In some deptt ,Environment is very depressing ."
bad,"Very manipulative and deceiving management. Schedules being altered for days people have off, people being scapegoated, pretty much a ""my way or the highway"" management environment that was running corrupt due to imbalance of power. I learned a valuable lesson working for Best Buy and that was self-worth. I decided my morals and ethics were above the store values and that is the reason I left; It was just too toxic."
bad,"This company rarely cares about the needs of its employees.  They will offer all these benefits, which are great but then when it comes to the work environment you will receive little help, especially during peak seasons."
bad,"The job pays great for full time, downfall is you basically can’t ask off from beginning of July to beginning of January. Because of back to school and the holiday. They call it a black out period. They give you PTO right when you start which is nice but no time to use it. The other thing is if you are part-time they will schedule you full time hours but get no full time benefits. The management at my store is not the best either, when you need a manager to come do an override or help with a customer escalation issue they try to pass it off to other managers. It can get very aggravating. No where to move up."
bad,Pay and store discount worth it. Management at Dubuque store is very poor.  4 managers or supervisors have left in less thsn 6 months.   GM is to hands on when there but is hone alot on family emergencies.
bad,The amount of work they want you to complete is unreal. They want you to force feed customers with products they don't want in order to hit our daily goals.
bad,"full of  favoritism."
bad,I found working here was not as welcoming as I would hoped it would be. I felt very intimidated by the managers and the other workers. It was not the best fit for me.
bad,have a back up plan great at first if your young but not good going forward       no longer there now no holidays off except Christmas day so work life balance is horrible
bad,"not a happy place too many chiefs. Strange hours, management has favorites. "
bad,"The Job and review would be a lot different if you were working on the sales side, but working in the merchandising department is by far the worst job there. Low pay and repetitive work make it difficult to even want to show up to work. Staff is Micromanaged and the hours are horrible. Not the worst place to work for, if you're in high school or just need a temporary job. Management was alright and employees were friendly but this varies location to location ."
bad,"Basically it’s like working for McDonald’s, it’s a good job to start but it’s not one to stay at for most people. It did help gaining customer service experience."
bad,"Management tries to play this ""we are a family"" stuff with you to get away with how abusive the job is. They pay you to work a job as if it is commission based, and then instead of using commission as a incentive to work harder, yelling is your incentive. "
bad,"Poor Leadership who do not care about their employees"
bad,"I had been with the company for 10 years. It took 5 years to advance to full time. The management always treated the in-line employees as a number. Understand, in a business  that is number driven, I can understand this. The company policy would forbid an individual to be written up or fired based on revenue alone. I will be the first to tell you (since I left the company as a manager) you couldn't convince a single employee of that. The company tries to give their employees perks, but in the five stores I had worked for, only one of those stores had a positive culture. The training is pretty garbage, mainly due to the lack of communication. The higher up management would encourage communication, but the store level managers would keep everything as if it were some secret that no one was privileged enough to know. These are only some of the reasons I left the company. The rest are private. If you do attempt to climb this corporate ladder, it will be a kin to trying to survive the game of thrones for Westeros. Good luck to you, whom attempt this task."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,There are a few good thing about working at best buy mainly the discount. The bad things unfortunately out way the good. My manager is extremely unprofessional and rude not just to customers but mainly employees and even other managers. I brought the issue up several times and nothing was done about the situation
bad,"Best Buy is a ruthless retail company that is a great place to start a career or get your first job. Asset protection is one of the only jobs in the store that is not held responsible for sales but theft instead. If you do the job correctly you will make contacts in law enforcement and other CRJ professionals. If you don't care about the job, you'll be a glorified door greeter who just stands around doing nothing when you aen't busy."
bad,"Departments do not work together. Rather than the store success being the ultimate goal, each department does what they think they need to do. Hard to get help between different departments, if needed. Multiple sales floor associates will take breaks at the same time, leaving departments empty. Inventory/merchandising/no sales associates then get pulled away from what they need to get done, to help customers, because sales associates are in the break room.  Can easily go long periods of time without seeing management. Some, not all, of the managers rely on other staff to do things, which I get to an extent..but a lot of these things they rely on the staff to do, is because they don’t know how to do it..yet they’re the ones running the building?"
bad,"I was not a big seller, and did not sell enough geek squad protection plans. Job was fine, for a typical retail job, but I felt communication should've been better. All in all a good job if you can sell."
bad,"Don't work here, life sucking place to work at. I had hoped to only work here part time but I am constantly scheduled to work 40hour weeks. At a very low wage"
bad,"It really depends on the store you go to. Some will be good some won't. "
bad,"-Typical day at work included stocking merchandise, organizing -back warehouse, taking orders and shipping orders"
bad,"I worked here when I went away to college and transferred to a local branch over the summer. The 1st summer I got a raise, everything was great, & I went back to college town & continued to work for Best Buy. The 2nd summer I attempted this there was new management when I went to my hometown. They put me in a department I was not familiar with but was willing to learn about, then they fired me when the general manager who I knew from the previous summer was on vacation. Long story short, Management can fire you if they don't like you personally & try to pin it on a company violation. Not only did I receive unemployment but I went back to my college town & my job was reinstated, I received back pay, & the General Manager from my hometown store had to call and apologize. It's retail so if you're looking to advance, you have to be friends with the managers."
bad,Best Buy focuses a little bit more on making sure you reach set budget than they do employees. It forces you to think if you are actually a valued employee or being used to make the store profit.
bad,Working there was difficult to manage personal life with work life due to how many days you had to work there.  Worked Monday through Saturday for 8 hours.  Managers were demanding on amount of repair work needed in an hour and in a day.
bad,"Security teams are Micromanaged and had little direction. Senior leaders were content with accepting risks that could be mitigated with change to processes or procedures that were lacking. "
bad,"bets buy is great for part timers or young students. my experience was not that good. at the store in dothan, al there was too much management on employee sexual conduct and black balling. not porfessional at all"
bad,Best Buy is a ok company to work for. they do have a fairly good company culture. it can be stressful being a cashier during busy season. overall not a bad job for starting out.
bad,"This company does not provide opportunities to work on long-term careers, nor advance despite having world-class customer service skills and knowledge of roles. It's about who you know and only favoritism. They do not follow company core values as much as they instill it in each employee."
bad,"I was switched into AP without my consent because the entire AP team quit. Its an easy job, all you do is stand in one spot for up to 6 hours straight"
bad,Best Buy expects you to perform a position that most other companies  pay much more for. We top out at what mid or entry is for similar level jobs. The more they can throw on you the more they will.
bad,"They gave you goals to meet that were not achievable. It was hard to sell $20,000 when there were no customers on the floor. If you missed the matrix they had set forth, you were put into an office and reprimanded.  Once I had a customer looking at an Apple PC in the store. I was working as a Rep for another company. The customer asked me a question about the product. I asked some qualifying questions. I concluded that a PC was a better choice then an Apple, based upon the learning curve it was for the customer.  I was noticed doing this. I was called into an office and told to let the other employees sell apple. (Yet my companies products worked with Apple, printers etc)..  I asked why and they said they made more money selling apple then PC's. Then the manager told me and I am quoting, "" In here Apple is GOD""  I laughed at him, I could not believe the arrogance."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Beaucoup de pression pour peux d'avantages autant salaire que assurance ,congés etc ."
bad,"I worked in a office without no management, when i needed questions answered they were fulfilled but when I needed help, no supervisors were present. Left me questionable about how selfish some of the coworkers were."
bad,"It was rough, it eventually leaf to my departure. I was scheduled shifts last minute no one told me about, they just assume you were to know. They provided me a option to mark when I couldn't work, but never followed it. So if you were in school or something, you were kind of out of luck."
bad,"You work at your computer virtually no discussion with others.  Just too busy.  Usually, work through lunch to keep ahead of the work.  Not expected just the norm"
bad,Most of the workers were fairly nice.  Management had no use for you unless you were a good liar.  You get in trouble if you do not manipulate people into buying things they do not want.
bad,"Some management staff were selfish and narrow-minded always had to be right, illtreated staff and pinned us against one another. Perpetuated unfriendly competition. After minimum wage raised, they didn't give raises to the people that were making less than minimum wage, then management scolded us for talking about wages. Overall just a hostile work environment due to management."
bad,"Management is awful, they never help you grow. The company cant promise its employees we will have a job. Inside a dying mall the odds dont look good, and everything is kept secert."
bad,"OK if your younger."
bad,"Working in Best Buy Mobile is a double edged sword. You can earn higher pay rates than other departments, but that is dependent on your hitting goals. They can be reasonable, or absolutely ridiculous. You will never earn a bonus during the months where you work and sell the most (i.e. the holiday season), and upper management will blame you for performance affecting their bonuses. The upper management will lie and mislead you frequently, in addition to publicly berating you on conference calls when your store's performance is below goal. You may be forced to implement an inane strategy for selling for your market while your upper management team lives in a delusional world where those strategies work (like 1965). Your experience will be largely determined by your direct superior, some of which are excellent. The reliance of this company on terrible upper management is laughable, and largely a contributing factor as to why their mobile specialty stores are being closed."
bad,"The atmosphere among coworkers is healthy and they'll always rush to help you when you are struggling. Management's guidance is non-existent and inquiring/striving for further training to advance in the company will get you no where and in all likelihood put a target on your back for harassment."
bad,"I worked in the PC sales department, and it was run like a commission sales environment without the commission benefit. The hardest part of the job was reaching their sometimes ridiculous sales goals. The only thing I really enjoyed about this place was my co-workers."
bad,"Poor pay, poor management and lack of advancement. The best thing was that you could move to other departments if you showed an interest and there was an open position. Other than that it was awful. I'd never go back."
bad,"When I started working there it was great, new GM came in and it was as if I was only good for one thing. I couldnt advance because they worried about numbers to much rather then trying to help a good employee advance and become more then a cashier. After 4 years I finally left, Best Buy it self is a great company, the store I worked for I would never work at again until its under new management."
bad,"Geek squad is no longer about rendering services, it is only about selling them. Everybody is pushed to the absolute breaking point to where you lose clients because of the hard pushes that management forces you to make."
bad,"Everyone was only for themselves and never helped no one. People always spread rumors. managers always pointed out the bad and not good, also was lowkey racist. surprised i lasted as long as i did."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of: hoping your co-workers would show up on time or at all(calling out, especially from part timers was rampant). Departments would be understaffed during crucial moments of the sales day, especially during the late afternoon/evenings which led to customer frustration. Department Leads, Managers, and Supervisors were always tied up with paperwork or other duties that kept them off the floor where they could step in to assist whenever needed. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Worked for the company for over 6 years. Years ago the culture of the company was very different now the sales team gets a lot of pressure, the managers are from other companies and often very inexperienced. In the many companies that I have worked for this one had the most turn over. Depending on the store you land on the story might be different but at the end the ethics are now the same, get a long with the managers no matter how hard or how bad you work. Their way to deal with ""bad"" employees is one - Gather paper work to get them out of here- Other companies will work on addressing internal issues and work with them."
bad,After the first day there they don't really tell you want to do you have to find someone to help you. Everyone is very competitive. Very young workers
bad,"At geek squad, you are scolded if you give any help at all without charging someone. I get that it is a business but if I can fix an old lady's issue with her browser without charging her 200 dollars I would gladly do that, and I think she'd be more likely to recommend best buy and geek squad to others. At the end of the day it is a results oriented job and if you don't sell as much as other members you get the firing threats. Money is worth more than happy customers there which is one way to run a company."
bad,"Low pay and push to sell sell sell but no personal benefit from it. Breaks are 30 mins and long shifts consist of you running around the store nagging customers to buy. Very micro managed and stressful. Employees come and go due to the culture. Days off are never together, they are spread out randomly during the week. No compensation for great work. Bonuses that they try to convince to people to seem really nice are heavily taxed to the point where they dont even seem like bonuses. No room for promotion. Great job for ages 16-19 not for adults who need flexibility and stable pay."
bad,"Working at Best Buy, you are asked to push a credit card in situations when people can't pay for items, saying that they can pay for it over time. If they can't pay for something in the hundreds of dollars upfront, paying it over time will cost more in the long run. That drains them of money they would need somewhere else. This was required by each employee to do. And each week your supervisor would talk to you about your previous week of sales, including the credit card applications."
bad,"I was overlooked 5 times in 4 years for the Home Theater supervisor position, which ended up being a crash and burn position for many who were there.   Pay was terrible, schedule was retail, which is generally terrible. "
bad,"Buen ambiente por el tipo de empleo y personal, administrativamente hay mucho desorden, entre esos horarios no controlados."
bad,"If you think that working with old and ornery customers is bad, just wait until you work with some of the team members here at Best Buy. I've seldom met a more unpleasant group of people (save for a few) who were less interested in helping each other and more interested in their own advancement at the cost of others around them. I don't say this from a position of being personally betrayed, but I've watched multiple deserving employees be turned down for advancement to be replace by those who brown nose more often. What's more, you will likely be promised advancement when this is merely a sham."
bad,"Company is good if you are a tech person. But for career advancement it’s not there. Upper management plays the political game. Can’t get anywhere unless you know someone even if you have put in the time, sweat, and years, as well as being productive. Pay is nothing compared to what is being asked especially when it comes to work life balance. Management does not look to train you to be better or advance, give no clear plans or path."
bad,"High paced job,and very competitive if your in sales. Hard for advancement in the company. Also if you work full time expect to work every single weekend."
bad,"I was excited to start my job and be a ""geek"" but that sadly changed when I found out the scattered hours, 4-5 hour shifts, lack of advancement opportunities and overall poor training. Best buy and Geek Squad basically treat their part time employees like a red headed stepchild. We're told to keep our hourly a secret to the rest of the employees, get 20 hours of sick time for an ENTIRE YEAR, no paid vacation and the only benefit is the store discount that's really only useful on there own brands. Sadly i regret my decision to work there."
bad,Really poor management work life balance is poor a lot of young people who call in sick all the time so you're always short of help work life balance is  non existent no real loyalty from management or Co workers pay is low for what we do managers have no real experience your job responsibilities change every couple of months and a high turnover rate met some great people there!
bad,"At geek squad you often deal with some advance questions, however they provide very little training. What training they do provide is no where near sufficient for what is required. To compensate that they look for well qualified people, however they want you to work for very little money while asking you to work holidays and take away time from your family. Geeksquad is a serviced based industry lead by investors. It was very often hours would be cut to make quarterly numbers look better. Due to the lack of hours computers would not be fixed in a timely matter thus making the issues worse."
bad,"Working for Best Buy, there is only 1 thing I have learned is that management is only concern is hitting budgets and they don't care how they reach these goals and their actions adversely affect the company results.  They preach that they promote from within but that is rarely the case, of the 4 manager positions that have opened no existing store employee has advanced regardless of their experiences/ qualifications and management never takes ideas or suggestions from the sales team that works with customers every day.  And sales expectations and wages are not fair or equal"
bad,The management is constantly playing favorites. It's impossible to feel like part of a team. Your life and overall well-being is expected to be the lowest priority on the totem pole.
bad,It was easy to advance but once you got into management it was horrible. They expect your whole life to revolve around the company and the pay isn't that great for management.
bad,"...no better place to work if you need a second or just a part-time job.  That pay is very competitive, the employee discount is excellent, and dealing with the near incompetent management is doable.  However..."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Best Buy's sales model is an anomaly in the world of retail, and non competitive in the world of consumer electronics.  I observed this through the operations side of the business.  It basically functions as an electronics showroom for Amazon.  In the midst of failing to compete, it doubles down on a used car sales mentality, and ultimately promotes managing sales over managing people.  It is the most aggressive of all sales environments that I've had experience in.  My earlier days at Best Buy, (i'e, before I was in a full-time position,) were far more enjoyable.  The work -life balance is manageable if you are part time, not so much if you are full time."
bad,"I worked front lanes. When it was slow (and it usually is) it was almost unbearable. You literally stand there and do nothing but wait for customers. Can't talk to co workers, cant walk around and find other stuff too do. You stand at the register. ALL DAY."
bad,Management seems to overlook the important things.  Older people seem to be mislead and steered towards the cheaper less reliable computers and seem to costly come in looking for help from the Geek Squad.
bad,Overall a very hostile work environment with very few good co-workers. The AGM was very unpleasant to be around and had absolutely no interest in helping you be the best you could be.
bad,Best Buy was a good Company to work for.  The Company flourished in it's earlier years and was a lot more employee centered.  Competition forced some changes that hurt the overall performance which I feel caused the loss of a lot of talented employees.
bad,"Best Buy/Pacific Sales is one of those good news/bad news places to work. "
bad,"Was employeed there for little under a year. For the most part it was ok, but upper management at my location was horrible. I honestly feel like they picked favorites at my location. You're not an asset to the company which is something that the company lacks they will look at you only as a number. When I needed help or seeked information I found it difficult to actually get the information. Granted not all locations are the same, but I'm just speaking from my experience there. I really did not look forward going to work which was a bad thing considering I was there for 8 and a half hours to 9 hours of my day there which made time go by really slow. As a vendor you're given full time hours which is good but say good bye to your personal life because you get no weekends off without requesting it off or calling in as sad as it sounds. You'd figure they would rotate weekends off but that's not the case. My coworkers were fun to work with and I actually enjoyed doing what I did aside from having no personal life.  They weren't flexiable at all with hours which was a main concern for me. My whole issue with the company was management and scheduling. However any future applicants I wish you the best and really hope your enjoy working there. I personally wouldn't recommend anybody working there if I'm are being honest."
bad,"Like most sales positions you will have quota goals which often conflict with what the customer needs. The disconnect between what customers want and what corporate packages or incentivizes are radically different. Great if you want to help people or move into IT, if you are passionate about sales, go to home theater. "
bad,"Boring place to work, struggling industry, low (but not the lowest) wages. High sales pressure environment. Company uses predatory (bait and switch) pricing tactics that borderline on disreputable."
bad,the hardest part of the job was being in a sales environment that didn't offer any compensation for it. Also working retail there was little to no work life balance
bad,"This is a job. Not a career. Simple as that. The pay is better than expected for a retail job, but still not worth what you're doing. The best part of the job was the employee discount."
bad,"I understand that each district/store is managed differently from the others so my review is only for the district/store I was in. Overall the store atmosphere was pleasant. Everyone understanding sales goals and working together to achieve them. The district management team, however, left a lot to be desired. I understand they have their own metrics to meet, but it doesn't take a genius to know that comparing stores in a small market to stores in a large market is not how you should plan sales goals. The company structured the metrics measuring to take that into account but that concept seemed to be lost on the district management team. Holding a store in small town MS against a store in the Houston or even Memphis market is setting unrealistic and unattainable goals. This puts unnecessary pressure on the store level management team which in turn puts pressure on the front line employees. That, in my opinion, is not a recipe for success."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Best Buy unless you enjoy being intensely micromanaged. The Discount is a decent pro, however it does little good for you with the skewed degree of work/life balance as you have little to no proper time at home or with family."
bad,"i worked for best buy for 3 years and they dropped me like a rock with no warning or anything and the reason they gave me was absolute bull. they said my attitude was not fit for the NPS they were going for but every time i got a survey with my name on it, it was always a promoter"
bad,Hardest part is balancing personal life along with work. Little compensation for such demanding positions. Get in good with management and it will be a smooth ride.
bad,"all i was was security, mostly just watched cameras, prevented theft, and checked reciepts of customers leaving the store to make sure no one was stealing. but not a bad place to work."
bad,"This job is a sales job with no option to earn any commission. They attempt to make it seem as if there was an incentive to sell by giving us a monthly small bonus, though the max we can earn is 10% of our hourly earnings."
bad,"Company's missions statement is to provide the best customer experieince to every client that walks in the door, however they underpay qualified techs on the same level they pay under qualified technicians. Management refuses to spend enough money to ensure that quality standards are being met with something as simple as staffing enough people."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"No work life balance. Your working from 7 am to whenever your done. Most days can last 12 hours or more and if you have a family you wont be able to spend to much time with them anymore. Holidays season is the worst. You work over 40 hours and get 1 day off in between. Management is all over the place and never getting anything done right. Hopefully if you work here your co worker will get along with you because if not, Your going to have a long week spending time with that person like it or not."
bad,The managers do the best they can and try to work with you to make a miserable job tolerable.  It's not really anything worth being proud of.
bad,"Decent pay and an enjoyable environment, but management is lass than professional. Very little opportunity to advance unless you're friends with a higher up."
bad,"Typical day at work can be either balanced between busy and very busy you are always on your feet and ready at all times for oncoming situations."
bad,The work gave us great hands on training with the customer but no incentive to keep working. People moved at their own pace which is fine but it seemed like they were slacking off.
bad,"All around, theres not much growth, very few managers are good. but You do learn a lot. They even work Thanksgiving which is just horrible."
bad,A typical day at work was usually very stressful as you would run into issues only management could offer an answer to but would never help because of how lazy they were. I definitely learned a lot there though. The management especially my boss were extremely lazy and very rude to customers and employees who they were not friends with. My coworkers were some of the best things about the job and were extremely helpful when we worked as a team. except for a few who were just as lazy as management. The hardest part of the job was learning their complicated system for checking people in that would change weekly.
bad,"Working at Best Buy you shouldn't expect too much. This job is more of a means to an end than a career path. It's a job that offers low compensation however decent work/life balance provided with flexible hours."
bad,"Not much room for advancement.  "
bad,"There is a high persentage of managers who are pressured out of there job only to be replaced by someone who understands less than the previous one, most tend to be young & inexperienced in communicating the needs of the company effectively."
bad,"I worked for Geek Squad for almost 2 years, started as a CA and moved to ARA quickly. CA is basically a sales man who occasionally installs simple software, the ARA position is a lot more rewarding in the fact that you're putting your skills to the test. My personal issue might have been with the store not staffing properly causing half of my shift to be spent out front helping a high traffic store and having to spend over time completing my own work. If someone slacks in the back you come back to a mountain of computers to be finished with no note on whats been done."
bad,"Best Buy has changed a lot of its values about ""family first"" and ""having fun while being the best."" There have been many trials and tribulations over the last 4 years that have caused a lot of people to be shuffled or have lost their jobs.  There have also been a lot of changes in payroll that have destroyed morale at the store level."
bad,This job was so-so. Management was difficult to work with at times. Co-workers within your department become very close and trusted friends.
bad,"this is a job for someone going to college , it was not a good place to work for an adult , long hours , you don't get paid your worth"
bad,"Fun and dynamic atmosphere. Difficult to advance due to lack of opportunities. Many qualified employees wait years, or need to relocate to make modest advancements."
bad,"My experience with Best Buy was an eye-opener since I was fresh out of high-school working in a retail job. I learned an extreme amount of information about businesses, people, and co-workers at this job that will stick with me throughout my entire life. Even though I had a somewhat negative experience during working there, I have allowed those experiences to shape the way I look at a job from there on out. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the discount i received. A typical day of work would be to punch in and be on shift, and then to make sure I was organizing, contacting, and helping people find what they were looking for."
bad,"The managers they hire should not be managers. They know nothing about managing for the most part, and even less about the technology."
bad,"Corporate culture is a sham. Pay is substandard. Some management was good, but majority was inept. There are some good people there but they are inhibited by a silly management structure."
bad,"On a typical work day, we are expected to sell approx. $500 per hour worth of product consistently. This is an easy goal for most employees during the weekends but near impossible to maintain for full-timers during the weekdays. Best Buy is a non-commission based company however sales goals that dictate whether you keep your job or not encourage that same mentality. This potentially makes it worse than a commission based sales floor because the is very little compensation for achieving goals. An average full-time associate gets approx. $10 per hour, with a %10 bonus give the ENTIRE store (including departs that said associate has no control over) consistently exceed budget."
bad,"Typical day at work for my position was bringing in new computer issues, handling and tracking them, troubleshooting software/hardware, but mostly they care about selling services. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,There is very little chance to advance. Most employees are part time so corporate doesn't have to offer benefits. Management is negligent in regards to the welfare of customers and employees alike.
bad,The expectations of this company for its employees is very high and the compensation for this work is very low. Especially when you compare this to the work load of management compared to their compensation which is astronomically high.
bad,"Best Buy has slowly eliminated the majority of their leadership over the past few years. This has left almost no openings for growth in the company. If seeking temporary work, are a student or need a part-time job, then apply, otherwise look elsewhere for a stable career."
bad,"Overall a horrible place to work"
bad,"You will get paid almost nothing to deal with some of the worst pushiest customers.  And usually during holiday season it's 20 people at a time.  Your managers will wreak of corporate answers and tactics, and you will never hear the end of it if you don't push enough people to apply for the best buy credit cards.  Seriously, work anywhere else."
bad,"Limited days off. Leadership never communicates. It's their way or the high way, yet company encourages employee innovation. VERY low pay, but high stress to produce results. Makes no sense. Blames employees when company is not doing well on Wall-Street regardless of economic conditions. Not good treatment of employees at all."
bad,Equal level co-workers are usually nice. Able to keep up to date on current electronics.
bad,"I have been with the company for 5 years now.  I have worked several different roles from cashier to customer service and have been in mobile for the last few years."
bad,"It really depends on the location. I have worked at other best buys that are amazing, but Greenville is not one of them. The management is poor and just keeps getting worst. The only enjoyable  thing about working there is making friends. The job itself could be very enjoyable if everyone was held accountable for their own positions but they are not and never have been. The hardest part about the job is trying to finish everything that you are responsible for. Unfortunately a lot of the things you have to do connect with what other people should be doing which is not getting done so you have to do both. Co-workers are great personal wise, most help if you ask for it. Everything really falls back on management not setting expectations and following them for everyone in the store. Favorites are highly valued in this store and you are lucky if you see the General Manager on the floor during his shift."
bad,"Fun work environment."
bad,Learned very little. It was more of a physical job. Not much of benefits.
bad,Engaging customers and creating a fun working environment were the best attributes of this job. The company is constantly restructuring and job security is non existent. High pressure sale environment with low incentives.
bad,"Honestly, this store had a high turnover rate with employees that are always feeling down. It is seen by the customers and the management did very little to change so."
bad,"* Deal with lots of customers"
bad,"Ok place to work, but not a good career path.  Not a lot of options for upward mobility."
bad,"This group is run by management who does not care about the people under them. They only promotes the selected group of people. The team I worked for has lost 7 people within a month and a half due to the management team. They have unreasonable expectations for anyone other then the selected group. No raises for last year and this year. Bonus requirements are raised so high it will be impossible to meet. If the team does meet it they are only allowed to divide our a certain amount of money, not allowing for actual job performance. No more working from home. Bad morale! I could continue on but feel I have stated many reasons to look somewhere else for a job."
bad,"Enjoyed working with my peer's."
bad,"I worked in various management positions ad watched as this company became less relevant over the past 10 years.  Management provides zero work life balance and uses the ""you signed up for retail, you knew what you were getting into"" excuse every year."
bad,Job was good to work with people and employees where great but management and company don't provide great promotions for work experience and degrees.
bad,"This company used to be amazing to work for. It seems depressing where it has come throughout these last few years. Just a shell of its former self. Store management and supervisors are a weakness for the company and very little professionalism. While working at Best Buy, you can't help but feel a general malaise set in."
bad,"There are no Benifits to being a Best Buy employee working in the call center, nothing from mangement is consistent, co-wokers are great, the hardest part of the job is dealing with supervisors who refust to take escalated calls, no real room for growth within"
bad,I learned over the years that it doesn't take much to work at Best Buy.
bad,"Management, including the GM of the store I've worked at had not respect for the employees."
bad,They make you sell like a commissioned sales man but you don't get anything for selling their overpriced junk.
bad,"This was my first retail job, I worked there for 3 years before I was employed by at&t.  Best Buy employees have a very low moral, there is a lot of micromanagement and very little compensation.  They primarily high school students, so for older employees who make a living there are not taken seriously.  It's a good job for a high school student but it's not good for making a living."
bad,"i couldnt stand it. i busted my butt all the time for the higher ups.. and didnt have anything to show for it. management is subpar, at best.. and the corporation is corrupt. the GM in training would always make fun of people, and stereo-type customers."
bad,"It was a fair job to work for at the time, not really any space for advancement."
bad,"This job was a seasonal gig. The company culture is to up-sell and push extended warranties. The pay was just above minimum wage. I had to plead for additional hours. Ultimately, at the end of my service the company decided to keep half its part time employees, while assigning double the responsibilities to its remaining staff."
bad,"Directed the sales floor and daily Geek Squad operations. Developed strategies to improve sales and increase profitability. Software and Hardware installation. System Restoration. System Security & Sales."
bad,"I worked at Best Buy for close to 3 years and spent most of that trying to advance past a part time position. I worked multiple positions such as sales floor, warehouse, home delivery and loss prevention. My contributions always went unnoticed and unappreciated. I was let go from Best Buy after catching a managers son shoplifting."
bad,They do not pay their employees enough for all the responsibilities. Management is the worse.
bad,"Completed customers transactions, attempting to sell Credit Applications and Protection Plans."
bad,"The biggest issue with working at Best Buy is it's management, from the store level all the way up to corporate. As soon as you are hired you will be taught to sell something""exactly like this"" and you're pushed to meet numbers, opposed to making sure you meet the needs of every individual customer. Best Buy as a company is failing because they have forgotten one of it's most important values, Unleash The Power of The People. They take away any of your individual skills and sales techniques by making you follow their guidelines which they wrongfully believe to be affective. I worked there for almost 4 years and there was never a time where I felt like we had good proper leadership, because of poor scheduling, laziness on their part, or a general lack of support for their sales team.. The problem is a lot of it isn't their fault. Micro-managing was always a problem as well. Most of the people at this particular store are there to collect a check and are not as passionate about their jobs and the technology that surrounds them as they should be, which, as an employee who is the exact opposite, can become frustrating. Scheduling is all over the place. Whether it be them posting the schedules late, scheduling too few people for efficient department coverage, or shifts that are all over the place, the scheduling system is the worse of any job I've had. The  most enjoyable part of working there was definitely the employee discount which is more than fair. Other than that, it is far too much work required for the little they pay you (good luck on getting raises) and it won't take long"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I have had 12 managers in under 2 years, it is constant change and not in a good way. "
bad,"supervisors only cared about numbers, i fell off a ladder once and my supervisor just turned his head towards me while he was talking to a female co-worker and went back to his conversation. I pretty much checked out after that."
bad,"A typical day at work is high stress, lacking business, but being held accountable to exceed numbers. You do learn a lot of business ac-cumin however the learnings they have for you you have to try and pass by a deadline so everyone just get's answers from one another not learning anything because there is no time to take it because you have to be on the floor helping customers all the time due to lack of staffing. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the thought that you might loose your job at any time due to restructures. the most enjoyable is some of the people you meet are good people and you gain good relationships."
bad,Incredibly stressful environment. Most of the day is spent ensuring that your staff is hounding customers and offering a barrage of products that aren't of much use or quality. Most of the employees are college students and do not take their job very seriously. This coupled with increasing demands from the corporate office and a fiercely competitive market make Best Buy a poor career option for anyone but single young people without many commitments.
bad,After the layoffs you were expected to do more work for the same pay. No over time and you had to pick up the slack for temps they hired in everyone's place.Managers are idiots with their heads up the general managers butt. Everything she says is like gold to them. One of the managers actually has limited english as do most of the techs. They preach values and culture but never follow through. The benefits are non-existent.....except for the discount you get at the store. Healthcare contributions by the company are minimal. Do not waste your time here! They have been on a hiring freeze for the past two years. The freeze means no room for advancement. If someone leaves the company they get replaced by a temp.
bad,"The work environment when I was at Best Buy was so impersonal. I feel like I never really got to know anyone there because there was just too many employees and no interaction. The managers were okay, but after my initial training they rarely spoke to me and did not follow up."
bad,"A typical day is a 5-8 hour shift if you are part-time. DO NOT pull out your phone even if a customer is not in sight. You will be yelled at. My supervisor was amazing, but my manager was very strict. The hardest part about the job was selling Geek Squad. You have to have 20% yes's per week, or you must go through training. Most customers do not even bother to listen when you try to explain the benefits. Also, working for hours alone in the store can get boring. There is always a camera on you that management watches, so do not pull out your phone. The best part of the job was weekends when you have co-workers with you to talk to when the store is not busy."
bad,"Open the store for morning taskers, verify all inventory and admin paperwork, assist with cycle counts, assist with counting registers and evaluate employees work weekly, monthly and quarterly. Manage at risk inventory through inventory research and merchandise to sell. Maintain clean and orderly warehouse at all times. Perform monthly alarm tests and maintain building maintenance. Write schedules, validate time off requests and fill in call outs when needed. During my tenure at Best Buy I have worked in the merchandising, media, inventory and admin departments, learning each new skill set in turn to teach to others. As a supervisor I have learned how to delegate, follow up and coach not only my employees but managers in turn."
bad,"This company gave very little compensation for the demanding schedule. It was not flexible at all, management would squeeze blood from the stone, and the quality of peers was poor. I would never work for this company or another retailer like it ever again."
bad,Did not feel welcome; expected to have known everything at once or from previous experience; minimal support experienced.
bad,Always encouraged to have fun while at work.
bad,>Sell more stuff...
bad,"This company goes out of it's way to make sure they do not have to pay more than they ""think"" they should. Employees are worked to the bone and given no reward. Advancement is nearly impossible and pay is rock bottom even for the most experienced. Management are shady and try to ween out those who they were prefer not to work with."
bad,"It was great when I started but the experience started to decline as multiple managers had different priorities and how most of them would talk down on their associates. Best Buy employees do not make commission what so ever. They sell black tie (protection warranties) and that gives managers bonuses on their pay checks but does nothing for the actual employee who makes the sale. Best Buy will always maintain a great atmosphere of the latest technologies but that's it ! It's not a great place to work, pay raises are awful, Managers get paid more for the work and services that you are selling. So all in all, Great atmosphere, Awful work place"
bad,This job had horrible leader ship and had no advancement oppertunities.
bad,"It's a good entry level position to work at Geek Squad as it will give you the standard IT work that most employers are looking for, however, you'll also be paid at 25-50% of the industry standard for how much work you'll do and is expected of you when compared to IT career positions. There is also not much space to move up in Geek Squad as the Best Buy corporation seems to not have many new higher positions open up and they'll often be given to external applicants instead."
bad,"Great company to start off/temporary positions.  However there's no work life balance, hours for part timers can be as low as 4 hours a week, and they demand the world to get the ""privilege"" to work full time."
bad,"Best Buy is a big company with a lot of employees everywhere. You won't feel special, you will constantly be asked if you are meeting sales & credit card requirements. If you work hard and put in extra time, go the extra mile, you will get a high five and a McDonald's soda."
bad,"I worked both sales and inventory, sales was better when it came to the enviroment. However inventory was over worked under appreciated and was treated as expendable. There were several instances every month where i would only have roughly 6-7 hours between shifts. To top everything off inventory worked more made the least amount of money."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I had a bad experience due to an illness and trying to go back with accommodations. The store level was very unwilling to work with me while corporate was more open to accommodations.
bad,"Spent 19 years at Best Buy. When I got hurt on the job,NO One Contacted me to see how I was doing. "
bad,"not an inclusive environment, impossible to advance. hours were lacking and there is never a guarantee of shifts every two weeks. management was closed off and it was impossible to fit in as an outsider"
bad,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good store manager. He paid the staff working there less than he would pay new employees. The work I did was worth far more than just 11.44 an hour. I had some assistant managers and sales leads, but it was overshadowed by a terrible general manager that didn't care about his employees."
bad,"Unless you're hired at management or above, take the job at face value. There is opportunity for advancement if you're in a location that isn't rampant with favoritism, which from experience, there seems to be very few locations. "
bad,"Every week my manager would schedule shifts that conflicted with my school schedule even though I constantly told them I had college and as soon as the semester was over my hours were cut severely even though the department I was in was understaffed according to most customers who shopped there. It is also not worth or fair it to have to sell over $1,000 per hour only to be making minimum wage."
bad,"Management does not care about you. You are just a number no matter what. Shady warranty plans even associates have no clue!! According to company policy, you are not allowed to work after hours. But management will keep sucking your blood from home like leeches!!"
bad,"If you like the pressure of sales or goals being thrown at you go for it. If not like everyone else in 2019 don’t bother with this store or company. They try to be little you over numbers which are sales, it’s childish."
bad,"Best Buy was a really depressing place to work. Even during my interviews the manager looked extremely depressed and like he didn't even want to be there. The discount is barely anything, don't count on using that to get anything good. I got three whole cents knocked off the price of a nintendo switch. I barely ever got hours either. The various sales departments seemed to enjoy the job more and talk to each other, but the warehouse is horrible. The pay rate is neat though, they'll pay you above minimum wage based on experience and increase it annually I believe. The only good part of stocking was during the holiday season when it was an overnight shift, and got paid 45 minute lunches. There was no other benefits to working overnights though."
bad,"If you are fresh out of school and like the latest electronic gadgets, Best Buy can be a fun place to work.  Competition is stiff for inside advancement and can take years to accomplish.  Benefits are poor and the starting wages are low adding to high employee turnover."
bad,"management has favoritism, terrible hours, hire too many people with not enough hours to give out.  Warehouse is a joke, too small to hold there inventory then put the blame on merchandising and inventory associates for lack of space.  So much wrong with this unorganized company."
bad,'ve worked here for 2years now and it has been the worst 2 years in my life. They expect way too much from certain individuals and when they go above and beyond they don't even recognize them. Management has SEVERE favoritism and chooses to hire mainly their friends so that they can talk in groups instead of doing actual work. A lot of people get away with things in the store but when someone else does the same thing they get written up which makes NO sense. Do not expect to advance in this company even if you are a stellar worker unless you are best friends with management do not even expect to be noticed for your hard work because you won't. I've been told that for my position they only need a body to fill a spot it doesn't matter who the body belongs to. They don't care about employees at all and only care about sales numbers. If you have other options... DONT WORK HERE!!!
bad,"After a recent restructure of the organization, Best buy is not a company I recommend working for.  They eliminated a ton of opportunities for advancement and combined a lot of positions together, giving employees double the previous work for the same pay (or hiring new employees at less pay).  They also added ASAP (apple authorized service provider) services to Geek Squad, which not only doubles the work for the same amount of people, but also makes the existing clients wait 2-3 days longer than previously in order to make an appointment or have a repair done."

If you have other options... DONT WORK HERE!!!
bad,Management changed many times under a 6 month period so it made it hard to understand where you stood with the company. Geek squad seemed to be treated as a separate entity to the rest of the business which only made it more frustrating when management shifted roles.
bad,"I have worked for Best Buy for four years, and I can honestly tell you our initial management team was fantastic! I loved my job for the first 2 years of working there before new management came in. Our General Manager was a constant liar and rarely appeared in the store as she is supposed to be. Our Assistant General Manager was just as bad and had a personal vendetta against everyone. Several employees and customers would say it is a very hostile work environment. You are not paid enough and hard work gets you nowhere. They will tell you that they are training you for management while the day never comes. It is a cheap and easy way to give you more work without actually getting paid more. Honestly, do not waste your time for this sleazy company. It is all non-commission commission based. AKA, you are tracked on sales and no matter how good you do, you never get paid more. They also believe that Best Buy should ALWAYS come before god, school, family, etc. Awful work environment and more stress than needed."
bad,Great entry level job but not a good place to work long term. Not a good place for older people that plan to work there long term. Very few opportunities to move up in the company and possible favoritism especially with people they already have good rapport with. Definitely good for young people to work there for a few years because they'll definitely won't stay there long. Probably until they finish their studies or find another job that's more flexible.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Learned the ins and outs of customer service and retail sales."
bad,"If you are looking for a steady job to earn just enough to pay bills, then this place will do. However, you won’t have a steady schedule and you will usually be short staffed because it saves the store money to staff less people which, in turn, will cause you unnecessary stress. Advancement is not really a thing within the company. If you do your job well, they will want to keep you where you are. They have no interest in your professional growth."
bad,"Cold be good or bad, depending on your management. "
bad,"This is the type of job where they have little circles and if you arent part of that circle then  working for best buy will be like being bullied everyday at school. If you dont suck up to managers then you'll get nowhere. They make you work every Sunday, all holidays, rarely ever have OT and will belittle you because they can easily replace you. It's just like being in high school with the type of environment that they have. It's a temporary job, if you can find anywhere else to work,  do it. I do not recommend bestbuy."
bad,"Dont fall for a slightly above average wage. The company is on it's way to being fully automated in distribution centers. The asrs has eliminated most physical labor jobs and the ones that remain (lift drivers, truck loaders) are forced to finish double the work in half the time to remain on budget (asrs wasn't cheap). They are essentially trying to get to where every major company dreams of being, 100% production 0% labor cost. Some people drive 30 to 40 minutes to come in and work 5 hours or 6 if you're lucky. And if uwant to stay and try and get more hours you its gonna be hard unless you're good buddies with leadership"
bad,"Best Buy was a company that showed a lot of promise and gave me faith in their business. After working there and dealing with my stores management team, I can honestly say that I would never recommend working for Best Buy. Our management team was unprofessional, lazy, irrogant, self-centered, cocky, rude, and did not care about their employees. They treated every member of our store like we were scum and only cared about how our store performed compared to others. If any issues were brought to them about how they could improve or why moral was low, they would retaliate by lashing out against the employees."
bad,"Best Buy was definitely a place for young people to get job experience, but unless you're the GM of a store you're not making a living wage. The amount of guff you get from customers is not worth the pay."
bad,I started at Best Buy in 2006 and it was so much better than it is now. Constant reorganization mixed with some truly  awful management  really killed Best Buy for me and the geek squad  is a complete joke they hired in people who didn’t know the difference between RAM and ham.
bad,"Best Buy is a great company and the pay is good for the expectations but Asset Protection as a position needs to be completely overhauled. You stand behind a desk for 4-8 hours and stare at the cameras. You're expected to find shoplifters but if you do you cannot confront them or else you lose your job for violating policy. If there is fraud or counterfeit situation going down you basically just have to watch and tell the cops later. Your hands are completely tied and you are completely powerless. You are simply a body at the door that hopefully deters criminals. A hopeless position with ABSOLUTELY NO advancement whatsoever. Your only hope for growth is to move out of the position. Management basically ignores you and acts like you don't exist, salespeople are annoyed at you all the time because you ask them to actually do something instead of standing around. I recommend Best Buy but NOT this position!"
bad,"It’s a monster game of thrones. I started this company when there were many seniors and supervisors. Every department was run great, but it has come to 3 politics driven individuals who don’t know what’s going on half the time. "
bad,It's nothing amazing. It's just your average retail job. If you expect anything other than a boring retail job with a rude boss you are in for a shock.
bad,Good for seasonal employment but expect to be put in a department then asked to be in 5 different departments at once and be removed from the department you wanted to stay in. Management loves to give write ups for anything. Forced to work holidays or you'll get a write up. They shove you behind a computer for training and don't elaborate when you did not understand something. Goodluck getting anyone to teach you how to operate the forklift. Early morning stocking was the only fun part of the job. Asked too much for too little pay.
bad,"Off the bat, Best Buy has a higher starting wage than minimum, and decent benefits (like the employee discount) that kick in after just a month of working there. But the good part ends there, unfortunately. There are very few full time employees, and all the rest are part timers, and every part timer gets very few hours (in the range of 10 per week) unless they’re sycophants to their supervisors. Going off of what I just mentioned, there is a very overwhelming amount of favoritism from management, and very few (just one at my store) unbiased managers. "
bad,"They try to keep everyone below full-time hours and your schedules are erratic. Managers are hired from without, or are promoted based on metrics that are easily exploited. There is high turnover and few opportunities for advancement."
bad,"They really need to assess how they treat employees. In the time I was there, it was a pretty bad experience. I was the top guy in my department and was paid 11.50 while new hires made 12. This was incredibly unfair seeing as I was senior to them and trained them. Not to mention I was the only employee to crack a million in revenue in a year period. I saw no bonus or incentives for any of this work. However, every single name brand model rep for Sony or LG made all the money off of my hard work. They are rewarded bonuses for overall monthly sales for thier companies. Bringing this up to managers and leaders is moot, because no one does anything about it. I would steer clear anywhere near this place."
bad,"The job has little to do with technology, and a lot to do with selling credit cards. At my location, credit card applications would buy you free meals from bosses as well as wide spread recognition. It would be seen as a bigger deal to get someone to apply to a credit card and have them be denied than it would be to sell someone a $1500+ TV. The company makes little money on products and primarily stays afloat by renting out space to companies like Apple, Sony, Samsung, etc."
bad,"learned a lot while work a lot of IT work, explaining to issue to costumers. Management is not the best but it is not terrible. Not a hard job if you know stuff."
bad,"the management at this particular one kept threatening to fire me if I didnt sleep with him, i followed procedure and went up the chain of command but nothing happened.  I left because of their lack of ice cream sundays."
bad,"Company is based entirely on favoritism, incredibly difficult to move up if you are female. Difficult to get compensated fairly and essentially no work/life balance. You are fully expected to sacrifice your well being for the company."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Work place is same like any other place. Politic is in every department and employee don't want any new person to grow or learn and stay with company. Old employee don't let new people take any work and management have no control of there team. They use all F....word and management can't stop them. So many different language are spoken beside English. It sound like we are living in Mexico not in United State of America.
bad,Best Buy will make you do more than what your job is and pay you less and screw you over. They do not care for their employees and will push yo to your limit
bad,"On the sales side it is not a job worth having."
bad,"Always worrying if your job is going to be shipped overseas.  The company talks really well... Sounds like a great place to work.  Then they start changing your job and refuse to even talk about a pay increase.  Next thing you know, your given three months to find something new."
bad,"The Company of Best Buy as a whole is not a terrible place to work other than the inability to have a work/life balance. I feel as if the intentions from corporate are there to do good and stand with their employees, but as that message goes down the chain of command to other managers it gets lost in translation. The communication from General Managers and Assistant sales and operations managers is very bad and vague. They push the items that heavily affect their scorecards and bonuses. Many decisions are based on how it affects their scorecard and not necessarily best for the employee."
bad,"I will not review, too long ago and was an outside contractor. Worked in deployment ops.  The management for that crew was questionable as to some of the moves made."
bad,"Working for Best Buy was not a great experience. It was great with growing and moving up in the company. But, you were expendable and replaceable. The second Best Buy does not need you they will fire or create ""re org"". The CEO doesn't know what he is doing, its all politics with Best Buy. My suggestion don't apply here or leave as soon as you can if you work there."
bad,Not enough money for the responsibility bestowed on any of the people working there. Workloads never cease and management doesn't acknowledge the fact that things always take time. Glad to leave. Only shame is I won't get discount anymore.
bad,As long as you do what is asked of you their no problems very helpful if you ask the right person. Bonus wa a good thing.  Learning the product was helpful. Long hours if you have training not the best
bad,"Didn’t feel comfortable there. The pay was unacceptable , the people that worked there we’re all about themselves and never really reached out to give you a hand."
bad,"Whether you enjoy your time at one of the retail stores is entirely dependent on having a competent, mature management team. That being said, the store I was employed at for the longer of my career with best buy, was neither of those things. Best Buy as a company gives you lots of opportunities to learn and grow. There are some opportunities for advancement, usually if you go to other stores and not your own. Most managers will get to a high level and then stay there so no one else can advance. Working with customers and clients is probably the best part of the job. Management puts a crazy amount of pressure on you to sell, so if you want to work there just to sell your heart out, go ahead. Best Buy isn't a career for most. It is a retail job."
bad,Worked at two different locations and very inconsistent and overall not a company that truly puts out a quality experience for employees or customers in my opinion at least.
bad,"Leadership was poor - worked directly with Founder of Best Buy and had do guarantee a certain spend amount each year with his relatives wood shop and fixture company.  Back end politics and misleading direction.  "
bad,"I am a full time college student and they refused to work with my school schedule. They had continued to write me up when I would be late. It was either I got fired from the amount of points I was acquiring from their mistake, or quit before it had gotten any worse."
bad,"I was not offered a job after Seasonal due to management I was beyond flexible with my hours willing to work full time I had even asked to do other departments besides cashiering, however I was shot down for a position from management even thought their were other people who turned down the job offers and I felt like I would be offered a position due to the fact that I worked for the entire season and went above and beyond and worked 14 hours on black Friday when others did not show up. I felt mistreated from there and the workplace"
bad,Mangers expect the world and are never satisfied even after being provided back-breaking labor from associates. Unrealistic expectations and thorough takeover of personal life. Warehouse required to work 5am every sunday morning.
bad,"Good network of peers, I made some great friends working there that I will have forever. Not a great place to advance in a career although. Great as an after school job."
bad,Management will treat you horribly or cut your hours if they don't like you or cuss you out like they did me and tell me I was wasted space and my life was worthless. So I would never work there again.
bad,"Extremely poor management. Work environment was like being in high school. Favoritism was very apparent, so was racial and sexuality profiling. Job itself wasn't hard and rather enjoyable."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,If you work in the warehouse everyone watches you struggle and you get no help. You have to work fast with no help at all. I do not recommend this company at all
bad,"Though I enjoyed assisting customers, the one pro I had did not outweigh all the cons of the job. Hours were very inconsistent. As a part-timer, there were no real health benefits. If you got extremely sick to the point where coming into work would cause others to fall ill, you would be written up rather than given time to see a doctor. This even if you were given permission to do so. There was also a point where I was written up for not being able to get back into the country on the day my trip ended due to a plane malfunction. This caused me to be stuck overseas until a new plane was obtained by the airline. As for the managers, they acted nice like a childish buddy, but they did not act like proper managers. They lacked communication between them, there were constant contradictions, and there was a great deal of blatant favoritism. I don't need a friend, I need a manager that does the job properly. As for the fellow staff, they constantly tried to backstab each other, spread rumors or perpetuate drama. There was also a great deal of inappropriate behavior from all staff members (excluding the GM)."
bad,No part of this store was organized or professional. The only way you would be promoted is if you were sleeping with a manager or had a very personal relationship with them outside of work. Certain managers always had HR cases open against them. Very poor environment to work.
bad,"Working here requires very little skill and is more a popularity contest. If you would like a full time position this is not the job for you. The manager was nice enough, but had no control over the precinct. The stores GM had more control but did not understand anything about what is needed to be technical support."
bad,"Best Buy employees are expected to train themselves for the most part via digital learning tools with minimal useful information and easy to cheat quizzes. These learning modules are expected to be done either on company time, eating into one's opportunity to improve their numbers (a highly emphasized part of the workplace culture), or in their own time to not be adequately compensated for the time logged. Knowledgeable employees are over utilized by lazy coworkers and management alike. In any of the stores in our district, two or three employees were asked to do 90% of the legwork while other staff acted as nothing more than warm bodies filling a role. Pair that with a wild pay disparity with no reliance on actual performance and the entire employee experience is abysmal."
bad,It's not what you know it's who you know.  Otherwise you will spend years as part time doing the work while your bosses benefit from it and take the credit. If you show that you have a brain you will constantly get passed over for advancement and have more work and responsibility dumped on you without compensation.  All sales staff are treated as if they are doing commision sales but nobody except store management gets the bonus for those sales.  You're basically working to make your bosses life better.   Great place if you're a high school or college student looking for a few extra bucks.  Otherwise it's a waste of time.
bad,"If you are a younger person gaining work experience, you will gain numerous skills and benefits from your time with Best Buy.  "
bad,"Worked here for a year doing all sorts of different departments and got one raise during that one year. Employee discount is great if you need some new tech, and for the most part most team members are extrememly knowlegeable and very friendly. Some members of managment prone to favoritism including the GM. GM also basically walks the floor with a bad attitude, being aggressive towards sales staff and customer service staff about not doing something or other, almost like he/she was out to find something to get mad about. Also consistently took personal calls while on the floor all the while scolding employees for being on their own phones. Some of the supervisors are really nice, and it can be a fun place to work at times, but the managment team is a bit too much for it to be worth it. Also you will be constantly hassled about selling ""service plans"" (warranties) and in store services, all the while not matter how hard you try you will still be asked about it relelntessly, and even blasted with a reminder every few hours about sales targets. Which by the way doesnt affect your own paycheck because its non commision with all the pressure of a commision position. Oh and random hours posted only 2 or sometimes 1 week in advance, making it hard to schedule your life as well as you will never get black friday or boxing day off, or christmas eve let alone the days before christmas."
bad,"Overall fun attitude at the workplace, however management is derogatory on many accounts. Not much room for advancement in the company after you have been there for extensive time periods"
bad,They offer contracts and full time positions but not a good place if you are looking to grow within the company. Work environment is dusty and humid. Highly secured facility and you cannot take any of your electronics past security door. Management is disorganized.
bad,"An enjoyable place to work when you're placed in a department you are skilled in. Unfortunately, store management can hold you in a place you perform poorly in, even though other managers desire your skills in other departments. "
bad,unless you just need experience which even in this case is none except to learn how to handle customers. You don't really do anything to fix computers and anyone can apply for this job which is sad most of the problems people come in and have can be fixed in less than 30 mins but are told it could take 2 weeks...
bad,"Working at best buy is very interesting. You definitely have your good days and your bad days. Some days the clients are great, your management doesnt complete belittle you and you arent micromanaged."
bad,"I cannot comment on the corporate culture as a whole as I seriously doubt that the management practices at the store I worked at are indicative of the overall culture of the company."
bad,"The company view is great, just the way its achieved is immoral and bordering illegal."
bad,The only thing best buy was after was to make money. You would be criticized for giving a customer what they needed and not pushing High priced Items.
bad,"A hostile workplace in which only dishonest male sales floor associates are rewarded or paid any attention. One must fit into the ""bro"" culture in order to be promoted. Lying to customers, sucking up to manager's egos, and cheating your coworkers will make you successful; however, working hard and doing your job with integrity will make you invisible. Minimal raises, and only at a year, and no benefits of any kind for part time employees. I was constantly harassed by my coworkers due to lack of professionalism and aforementioned ""bro"" culture. I worked at two different Best Buys in two different states, so this wasn't just one bad store. It's the company culture, and it's a bad place to work."
bad,"Organizationally, Best Buy change averse. Those with authority are reluctant to use to solve problems but quick to use it to demand attention to their problems. People are generally friendly but lack follow through, the I.T situation is terrible and makes it harder to accomplish work. No apparent reward for doing well, no apparent consequence to cutting corners, upper management too far removed from work. Those with authority can play favorites, and the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives seem to be hostile to those who are straight, white, male, and/or conservative."
bad,"It has been a while since I worked there. But I don't have any real fond memories of my position. Unfortunately that is the case I wish I could provide more information,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Obviously as a business this company is profit driven, but it too comes at a cost. Staff are pushed into up-selling customers on service plans and installation set ups for home entertainment systems. Although there is no commission, Managers and Supervisors receive quarterly bonuses when sales targets are met."
bad,They laid me off during my grandmother funeral and my grandfather pass a couple weeks before her at the time we were slow so they told me to take off then call me when out of town attending funeral management sucks so BAD!!!!
bad,"Management is hard to deal with, worked for company for over 8 years and watched managers come and go. If not within the a certain group of the company you are easily let go. Very hard to move up in the company even if you are more than qualified for the job."
bad,"Usually Not Family Friendly, Employees who flirted with management or partied usually got the hours and the promotions and all of the management favors but not the ones who are clean."
bad,"While Best Buy is your typical retail position, they want you to be an expert on your field, but are not willing to pay for your knowledge.  They want you to keep up on e-learnings, but don't want to give you time to do them.  Their promotion to management positions isn't based on leadership skills or ability, but on popularity and how much  you can sell.  Leadership will also not back you on expired coupons, and will usually side with the customer"
bad,Not for me. Hours sucked. Really only wanted the job for the discount. But I definitely couldn't pay the bills with the hours or salary I was receiving
bad,I used to love my job.  For nearly two years I enjoyed coming into work daily.  However poor management choices and the half baked introduction of their Apple Service program has left a bitter taste.  Constantly overbooked on appointments and some of management will vehemently refuse assisting with clients.  One of the major flaws I have found was I had to submit a corporate HR report and it has been over a week from them with no word.  Proper tangible evidence was submitted.  Real question is why does it take so long with so much incriminating evidence for their investigation to take?
bad,"It's understood that working in retail has odd hours, but if you have a family or hold religious beliefs for specific days (Shabbot, Lord's Day etc) this company will not work with you on hours. They demand that you work specific days regardless of your availability. I was told, ""If you ever want to advance in this company, you have to let us tell you when you can work."""
bad,"Lots of hard work, long hours, unfair managers, but decent job. The pay wasn't worth the long hours and poor treatment and constant work with no breaks."
bad,"It was an okay place to work, good job if you’re in high school and just looking for some extra money in your pocket. Best Buy is not a long career job"
bad,it is always slow everyday of the week and when its slow they want to push sales and it hards when theres no customer. Management say they care about there staff but they are care for whats right about the company.
bad,"People are awful the ones you work with and the ones you help, you have to work with children and some may even be your boss, the advancement is a joke and all everyone does is talk about each other behind everyone's back"
bad,"im not a bitter employee at all but they could use more help and less hours, I worked a 16 hour shift and was asked to go in on my only day off to work another 12 hour shift, no thanks."
bad,this place was the epitome of a high school applicants job. The environment was like that of a high school movie. Fast times at ridgemont high kind of stuff. far too immature to consider a professional job
bad,"Management only cares or their own career. loves to micromanage"
bad,"This may not be the company, but I found that Best Buy was a job that cycle people thru, and management care more about bonuses that they do their employees."
bad,"I have worked for BBY for almost fifteen years , during that time i have seen many under handed things. Management plays favorites and its hard to get decent raises."
bad,I worked the at this company for a whole 2 years and as far as what I learned I was screwed left and right. They started me out as a seasonal worker and then a part time. I was promised full time which I received with little to no compensation or pay increase. Management was okay back then but today's management is no where near what we had back. A typical day of work isn't all to bad just your co-workers you have to be wary of. The workplace seems fine at first but gossip is huge in most so I recommend staying to yourself and learning the rules as I had. The hardest part of the job was the fact that even if you made the sale most of your time is taken up waiting on keys or someone else to help you when you are new and have no idea where things are. The most enjoyable part of your job is when you can find people you can semi trust JUST WITH WORK nothing else. Then you can at-least know the day will be easy enough and everything else will be easy.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"open register in customer service, assist customers with returns/exchanges. check prices, process credit applications, return items to the sales floor. Act as back up cashier when store was busy."
bad,"manque cruel de collaboration , formation des recrues bacles et laisser a leur fin , incroyable."
bad,"I was hired for overnights during the winter holiday season, which had responsibilities of cleaning displays and computers and tv's, setting new planograms, stocking, and sometimes setting up new displays and computers. While the work was fun the times I was there during the day, I loved the energy and engagement other employees had with the customers. I have seen however lack of communication is rampant among the supervisors and management and this created far more work for all the other employees and a lot of work would be foisted off to the people working warehouse."
bad,"Company does not care about tenure or the level of experience on brings to the table, but rather how little can they pay you and keep you under their thumb so you will not outshine higher levels of management."
bad,"Never again. No set schedule, minimum raises, little to no room for job advancement, temporary jobs that lasted sometimes no longer than 2 weeks. Work performed does not equal proper pay, sometimes work performed was in dangerous conditions."
bad,"Raises and promotions were based on meeting the 20% minimum Geek Squad Protection attachment rate, as well as getting at least Best Buy credit card application once per day. Employees would lie to customers to get a yes. My supervisor would keep be until 11PM to do inventory and labeling not in my job description, when I was scheduled to leave at 9:45PM. Supervisor and upper management were rude and never made the job enjoyable."
bad,"Management was corrupt, they hired friends of theirs and paid them twice as much as employees that had been working there 15 years. Multiple employees had been there between 10-15 years and hardly had any pay rate and were still at just ""worker"" level no promotional or supervisory position. Goals are nearly impossible to reach and workers suffer the consequences. Not to mention I was fired because I was pregnant and they did not want to pay my maternity leave, not a guess or rumor I was told this by several of the higher ups. There 'reason' for having to let me go was I supposedly stole $2.50."
bad,Small hours. Little actual hands on IT anything. Mostly just selling packages to allow another company to fix it.  Co-workers were cool to work with. Management didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time. There was no sales initiative. Mostly all we did was box things up for them to be shipped to our distro center to be fixed or let another agent remote in and fix everything.
bad,management is bad. always pushing you to work like a slave. pay sucks a little too but everything else is great. you dont get any commision but would have to work alot
bad,"Its an ok place to work,"
bad,unless Best Buy was your 1st job and your there 10+ years or are the managers favorite you will not be moving forward. this company has managers that should not be managers. this company needs a heavy restructure on culture and work ethics.
bad,"Its a favorites game.. get on their page and play the game of suck up or youre out. Dont ever get pregnant or have family issues, they will say family comes first and then fire you for it. Discrimination at its finest."
bad,"Travaillez chez Best buy Laval n'est pas le meilleur endroit. Laissez moi vous apprendre une chose les gérants de magasin ont des BONUS lorsqu'ils atteint les résultats des ventes plus ils ont des ventes plus gros est leur bonus. Donc plus ils font de vente, plus ils vous poussent à vendre entre autre des plan de service GSPT (garantie) ou GSM qui rapporte ÉNORMÉMENT d'argent au magasin. Les vendeurs au best buy Laval sont surveillez sur leurs vente, taux de vente à l'heure et plan de service (garantie) vendu. Ils ne sont pas à la commission ce n'est pas de leur faute mais ils ont tellement de pression pour augmenter le bonus de leurs gérants que bien des fois l'atmosphère est invivable. Lorsque les gérants vous disent que l'on offre des services pour le client c'est vrai pour le 1\4 de la clientèle, le restant ils ce font avoir en achetant des services qu'ils ne leur sert même pas et que l'on force à vendre (vente par heure et vente de plan de service (garantie) par employé). Il y a un roulement d'employé EFFROYABLE au bestbuy laval il y a une raison. Ce sont celles mentionnés ci-haut."
bad,This company is good place to work if you are only working part-time or full-time. It is not good when you are trying to become someone in the company because they have favorites.
bad,"The positives of doing remote support are:"
bad,"Not a good place to work for. If you are not liked by management, your days are numbered. Always watched via cameras. Its like the cameras in the store were meant to watch employees versus theft in the store."
bad,"Hard to move up, wrong people in important positions, too much disloyalty and low pay. Not too mention on a 10 shift standig all day they want to only give you a 30 min break."
bad,"Une journée au Best Buy est agréable, si tu es motivé à vendre même si tu ne reçois aucune commission."
bad,I worked at Best Buy for almost five years and the raises were horrible. Management would hover over you. Part time employees had no benefits and holiday hours were brutal.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"A typical day at Best Buy as a front lane cashier involved staring at the walls waiting for customers to arrive, arguing back and forth with managers and other co workers who refused to help during peak sales times. The most enjoyable part of this job I must say was working with a FEW good people. The rest of my co workers were a**holes."
bad,"While one of the company's primary goals is to empower their workforce, they have yet to provide many stores with the tools and training necessary to keep up with the demands of an instant gratification culture. In my particular experience, the people I worked with were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not a place to start a career.There may have been a time in which one could start on the sales floor and work their way up the corporate ladder, but those days are long gone. The turnover rate in this line of work is high and that is only exacerbated by rude, impatient customers and sluggish, outdated software systems that hold up sales transactions."
bad,"Customers, even when rude and wrong, will always be treated like they are right. Working at geek squad you try so hard to help the customer and resolve their issue. However, sometimes there is nothing you can do. Management does not want to lose a customer so they will always give the customer what they want, even if it is just to yell in your face and belittle you."
bad,"Where do I begin?  This company, or at least the location where I have worked is one the most dysfunctional, unorganized, and oblivious places and people I have ever worked for.  The trainings are almost completely done over the company's training site, but hardly in person!  The hiring selection process was so unorganized that it's almost like seeing how long you can hold your breath until you pass out!  And lastly, I had applied for a full- time position but after being hired the management kept insisting that I was only , ""seasonal,"" which meant work the Black Friday season and then, ""your services are no longer needed,"" but without anyone actually saying it but rather just cutting all hours to 0.  I would only suggest this job to someone who can afford to not make any real money!"
bad,Fun and educational work environment providing you have the right leadership. No stability in hours or schedule. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and the public at most times. Environment leaves employees open to abuse by customers.
bad,"not good long term, company changes too much even concepts that do not need changing - company went through a purge and downsized but instead of paying severances they terminated a bunch of people who had been with the company for a long time for meaningless things but conveniently only employee who had a substantial hourly wage"
bad,"I had worked at Best Buy since March, at the Cherry Creek location before I just could not handle the management and style. My managers were very unreceptive and if I had any issues he'd let me fail before I'd get help."
bad,"I was typically just a cashier, and thats all I really did."
bad,"The job wouldn't be so bad but they whip you to death with Sales Per Hour and Learning Labs and Geek Squad Protection and getting Credit Apps and a bunch of annoying policies and routines. Some people will probably thrive here... The work is light, but it's just so dang corporate that I wanted to kill myself."
bad,"It's hard to set concrete plans in your life with a job as fluctuating and chaotic as this one, and for the amount of stress you can experience dealing with the public, there isn't adequate compensation."
bad,"The managers give promotions and raises based off of who the like not who is best for the position. If you are part time they work you like full time and refuse to give you any promotions. My coworkers were great but felt the same way. The easiest part was getting the repairs done on the computers, the hardest part was management always pushing you to oversell. The most enjoyable part of this job was making the customers happy."
bad,"I typically was the only one doing returns during the day and no one seemed to want to help out when asked, only when told by management."
bad,"The people you are helping are typically grateful for your assistance. All im willing to say is the management was a joke as well as the bureaucracy is at an all time ignorance, for the rest I just to use discretion."
bad,God awful place to work. I worked in media management and all I did was change prices.  The corporate system is no synchronized with the store ever so the job is ten times more difficult than it needs to be
bad,"as a seasonal, they don't set you up for success. Management didn't allow enough training to be able to reach the sales floor fully informed on products and services. The coworkers were really cool but management was bipolar and unorganized."
bad,"Get ready to pucker up,  those whom kiss rump move ahead or just stay at least.  The are a few honest hard working veteran employees here whom are willing to get the job done.  The majority however will take the easiest jobs,  pass off the large orders and whine and complain behind everyone's back.  Management can't agree on anything and you will consistently be warned for doing something wrong or not this persons way. In my time there I've seen people come and go left and right both temps and bb employees.  Promise the world during peak season and over hire and throw you to the curb when it's slow based on seniority."
bad,"Worked my butt off to be promoted and was very successful at my job I was awarded several times with being the best in my district, when the company restructured i lost my job due to my GM keeping his friends. Very disappointed with how i was left out to dry."
bad,"Stay away from Puyallup Wa store, it hard to work with the management who isn't willing to adjust to workers request. To the management the customers come first before their own employees. I wouldn't work there ever again."
bad,I was expecting atleast a letter to let me know they weren't going to be keeping me for full or part time and they never even called me or anything.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Do you like missing Thanksgiving dinner with your family so you can catch some sleep before ""Black Friday""? Do you enjoy endless promises of promotion by management just to be undercut by the company's constant restructuring? If so, then Best Buy is the place for you!"
bad,The values of the company has changed over the years. The main focus iis on selling and not what's best for the customers.
bad,The Job Has Its problems Managerment does not help employees with noting and they are out of touch with employees....
bad,"Best Buy is not a bad company to work for, it may just be the store I was at (Christiana, DE) There is so much favoritism in that place, and if you aren't loved, you get no hours. It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, everything with them is personal and there is no room for advancement. They will not let you move up from the position you were hired for unless you are a suck up. A typical day for me was returning items, and doing pickup orders and transactions, It is an easy job, but they do have VERY high sales expectations. Even being a cashier is a sales position because you have to sell protection plans and get credit card apps every day. Also, the benefits for part timers are foolish, and there is no job security. When you get hired, on you first day they have you sign a form stating that they can fire you for any reason they want, and they do. They did it to me."
bad,Asset protection is the worst/boring job of all time. You work long hours standing in one place. You are a glorified greeter. The turnover rate is high there because they don't care about your schedule AT ALL.
bad,"I handled customer sales, returns and helped with computers."
bad,This job is good and pays OK at best if you are a good salesman. if your not you wont have a job! pushing sales number down your throat daily.
bad,"Working at Store level is okay and management is okay depending on the store you work at,  Upper Management is fairly typical for a large electronic retailer."
bad,"Not the best.  CMMI level 1.  Some of the so call managers have no real management skills."
bad,It's ok. Expect a lot of infighting and inconsistencies from management. Discount is decent and cutbacks are frequent.
bad,"If you're the type of person who likes to make to do a job then go home, forget about it. I'm not the best at making friends quickly, so I never 'fit in' that well. Make friends with people AND do your job well and you may get to stay"
bad,"Best Buy is fun to work in with the right people. Unfortunately Best Buy is not how it use to be. Leaders in the building are faced with a pile of work that needs to be done from above and no time to get them done. The job involves fixing customer facing issues, employee issues, meeting deadlines or reports and being on the floor to handle sales - its too much for anyone. I have learned a lot with the time I have been with Best Buy, in no doubt am I ready for anything that comes my way but the lessons learned were hard and self taught. The best part of the job is making a great customer experience and that is what drives most employees in the store. Management is unstructured and does not provide much in the way of training to do your job because of the stress of getting their own tasks done."
bad,Everybody does what they're supposed to but management acts nasty and treats employees terrible.  They expect you to come In on off days then when you can't get angry and act childish.  I would not recommend ANYONE working here.
bad,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you want discounts but not for a career unless you are a salaried employee. Constant badgering over using selling guides gets old real quick. I have been in retail for a long time but for such a big company that has watched other similar companies crumble around it, I'm not sure how they still survive. Agile as a company, somewhat. Do they care about their sales reps? Not at all. There is always someone who can take your place and fill out a sheet."
bad,I did not enjoy this job simply for personal reasons that I do not wish to share.
bad,"The Best Buy Service center was plagued by poor management and an obvious supporting of favoritism.  As a Parts Processor I was tasked with retrieving used computer parts from computer technicians and processing them for potential resell.  However, the work environment was tainted by weak management who had little motivation to increase the buildings moral.  My co workers were decent but with the lack of high moral through management I dont think our relationships grew to it's full potential."
bad,"Close to home, great discount, management issues, great team environment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Fun position, alot of positive energy and good people. Became very chaotic and disorganized at times but thats retail."
bad,It's an EXTREMELY high paced environment so you must be ready for that. The benefits could be better and the pay isn't exactly as high as most of the competitors.
bad,"It really depends on location, but it's not the best company. The management is very bad with communication, they change the rules every second, there are a lot of confusing procedures, they make you lie to customers about Geek Squad policies, constantly make promises they do not keep."
bad,"Each day was a different schedule and a different day off. Closing shift one day, opening the next."
bad,"Best Buy has turned into a ""be the best friend to advance"" type of company. Your time with the company or experience will not count towards any advancements in the company. The only way to get promoted in the company is to know a lot of people in the right places and be ""best friends"" with the managers. The co-workers were great and respectful and the daily work was great but is not a place for a career. I worked for the Geek Squad department and they are the underdogs being ignored, under appreciated, and forgotten by managers. The new changes in the company will make one of the biggest computer repair names disappear and make it just another customer service department for the Big Blue box."
bad,"It's a fun atmosphere. You'll have typical problems with phones, carriers and plans but nothing like the hassle of the loaner phone program which requires redundant paperwork, deposits, and use of a very faulty system for requesting repairs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. There are definitely ways to streamline the process as this waste your time as well as the customers. This is a job that is based on performance, perform well and you keep your hours, perform poorly and your hours are cut, shifts cancelled. Politics are commonplace, friends promote their friends. Best Buy cares about Best Buy. "
bad,"For the most part, in spite of being a ""supervisor"", a typical work day was spent dealing directly with customers and not coaching and training the employees. Staffing was usually cut to offset struggling sales. Management would spend more time belittling and berating department supervisors instead of helping develop them. Upward mobility usually stopped once reaching supervisor status as management was usually brought in from external sources. I had the opportunity to work along side many good people, some of whom I still keep in touch with today. Once the shift turned from being the best place to shop for consumer electronics to the only place to shop for consumer electronics time spent at Best Buy was laborious and unrewarding."
bad,"Working at Bestbuy is the perfect transition job for just graduated high school students. Talking to customers all day in non commissioned sales, the pay isn't great until you make friends with management and ""drink"" the kool aid. If you live, breathe and think about Bestbuy all of the time, you can make a place for yourself there. If you are just looking to work, it can be tough to move forward or to get good compensation. "
bad,"Have worked at Geek Squad City, Best Buy's primary laptop repair facility for seven years."
bad,This job was defiantly a pleasure i thoroughly enjoyed working with a team closely. I was excited to work and help customers. the tasks and responsibilities were never to hard in fact they always provided a challenge. The management team was young so it would be unfair for me to expect seasoned managers. At this place job i was faced with a few challenges when it came to my co-workers. this job defiantly helped me grow a thicker skin and learn how to handle chaos productively. The hardest part of the job was learning how to close the cash office at the end of business. But in a short period of time i was able to master everything that was expected of me. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customers in a timely and productive manner.   
bad,"The typical day is usually ok, co workers are usually friendly and fun to work with. It's alot more the management and the company itself that is the issue. They say there is no commission but I think it is more commission of a different type. We are pressured to get people to take surveys, and if we dont get surveys with our names in them we can actually get in trouble. I offer the survey everytime, here and there i forget someone but even my supervisor agrees i do a great job offering, and then i get 'talked to' if I don't get enough surveys. You try to do your best but it never seems to be enough, and there are DEFINITELY favorites! Which is very frustrating to deal. If you like selling, go right ahead and apply, but it's nothing like they tell you its going to be..."
bad,"I always wanted to work for this company and once I got the chance for the first six months, it was great. But new management came in and took away my position and lowered my pay and other employees too. They said it was because of the economy , but the way they handled it was very unprofessional."
bad,Overall its a good place to work to expose yourself to technology and earn some income while in college.
bad,"This job was seasonal, but you are constantly treated badly by the customers, the other employees, and the management.  Very hostile and competitive work environment"
bad,Processing transactions and taking in inventory of used games. Ability to move up in the company was very hard and all but impossible unless you had a standing relationship with the management. No matter how well you worked you may never be able to be promoted. No guarentee of hours nor benefits.
bad,"If you are a single, kid free, college student, then this place is great to work at. If you are hired seasonal, make sure that you get known by everyone, because if a position becomes available and everyone don't know you then you will not be kept. The manager will even tell you that. Managers changed 3 times in 3 months and the store manager was hardly ever there."
bad,"Basically put, if you're at Best Buy long enough you get a FT spot and never have to work again. They take advantage of the hard labor that PT employees put in, meanwhile their FT employees basically hang out and chat all day. It's irritating and unfair. The also put unqualified people in management spots."
bad,I enjoyed working in the stock room at best buy but I didnt enjoy how I was treated there and they didnt give me any notce if i had still had a job but I learned alot working there and was thankful for the oppurtunity.
bad,told me id have hours and then cut them last min. hard to get another job and keep this one. only looking for another job due to the loss of hours. i dont recommend it.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Employees are nothing more than cattle. If you work your way into a better position, with better pay, you become a target. Anything they can find fault with is reason enough to let you go or lay you off. If they can find someone who will do your job for less they will. No one feels safe. The management holds the bad economy over your head and demands more from each employee, for the same pay. Most everyone I worked with was looking for a better job while they were working there. Those who weren't had given up."
bad,"a typical day here was running the appliance dept ensuring that all dept goals were achieved as well as being an effective sales person ,myself i learned many aspects of being in management,my co-workers were sometime fun but some were immature that however is to be expected in this type of enviroment the hardest part of my job was dealing with the immature behavior and the most enjoyable was seeing how my accomplishments paid off."
bad,i love working with my co workers not so much the managers and the hardest part of the job was when managers push you hard to get the sale even when customers say no
bad,Nothing great and nothing too bad. The staff were really snooty and arrogant with the customers and my supervisor was more worried with quantity than quality of sales.
bad,I provided exceptional customer service to all customers and also handled cash register and answered telephones.
bad,"I initally applied for Best Buy because I was under the impression that they were a company that encouraged education and advancement within the company. However when I arrived it was the complete opposite. The managers and supervisors were more concerned with socializing with eachother and never came out of their conference room, even if an employee needed assistance. The only requirement for advancement was to make sure that you socialized at all times with the supervisors and managers. As long as you were their friend you would advance. I am a firm believer that your work ethic and performance should determine advancement. For the most part, I was left to learn about the company, the products, and services through their website and educational videos. I have always been an employee who can work independently or as a team. I enjoyed all of the interactions with the customers and the joy of helping them find the product they were looking for."
bad,The management always treat you like you're replaceable in a heart beat. Not to mention the people who advance are always close friends of the GM or other higher up managers. Great sales experience though.
bad,"I help customers decide what is the best electronic equipment for themselves. Customers are not the issue, management of the store is the issue. They do nothing in the store and dump duties onto normal full-time and part-time employees."
bad,All the managers care about here is the numbers. At the end of the day you are just another person that works there to get the numbers better. That is all that matters.
bad,the job itself was interesting but would have been better had I gone through training before starting. I only know so much about phones and without the training it was very difficult to work with some customers.
bad,"The people who work there are fun and nice, but the management is very pushy. We don't work on commission so management has to find other ways to motivate you."
bad,"I admire the enthusiasm of the team; it's a great feeling coming to work with my team ready for the challenges ahead (mainly my supervisor and co-workers - dis-includes management for specific reason). A typical day at work is usually busy, accuracy does take a small but extra amount of time, speeding through details is not my way of teaching the people whom enter our store about their computers, knowledge is truly power for the customer but, retail isn't exactly accurate with the information details of the computers we sale which causes returns due to managements way of training while on the sales floor. I learned that technicians are detail oriented; like myself. I find it glorifying when a customer gives me a compliment for giving them my honest opinion on hardware and explaining why services are truly important to have a working computer for the few years to come. In sales revenue is king even if the company loses money on returns and of course losing service opportunities by not giving the customer a sense of need for the services Best Buy offers which are excellent and bests most of companies today, also explaining to a customer why a computer wouldn't be for them and their work, career or for their specific software. My co-workers agree they are very enthusiastic for having the information they need through my research for the hardware we sale. Gives them motivation, a happy look toward the reason we are there working together and not against each other. The hardest part of the job would be identifying customers whom are looking for a past time, which does take up time,"
bad,"Busy days filled with busy work. Learned a lot of different techniques and styles as well as became very proficient at scorecards, P and L, labor management, coaching and counseling. Very challenging and had to be time efficient in order to complete daily and weekly activities."
bad,"I always try to discourage people from applying to this low level, scum of an employer. The company comes across as very honest and trusthworthy, but on the management level and higher is nothing but a group of snakes who only are in for the money, even at the expense of making employees uncomfortable. I learned a great deal of customer service skills, but that can be aquired at almost any retail job. DO NOT apply! Let's watch their blue and yellow ship sink faster together."
bad,"Management was horrible.The majority of my coworkers were males, and my manager highly prioritized my male coworkers. I liked my job, but it was impossible to be treated fairly."
bad,"Haven’t worked there in a few years but was literally told, despite my skill set and being asked to work multiple departments due to my knowledge, I was not worth making more than people hired after me with less experience and knowledge"
bad,Best buy was a really bad decision for me...terrible leadership in the department I worked in...get to work at 530am...just standing around all hrs know placement there for workers...just a standing body doing nothing...
bad,it was just another job ok I guess. People were nice and management was ok. Could have been better. Need to focus on costumers needs and satisfaction.
bad,Was flexible for being a full-time employee as well as a full-time student. Higher management needs to take a real look into improving store management and holding them accountable.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Management plays favorites and likes to underpay workers. They only promote yes-men and not people who are actually right for the job. You probably won't see your family ever and they don't allow doctors notes if you are sick. They won't allow over time and if the management does not like you they will reduce your hours until you quit on your own accord. You will have unfair goals and metrics to hit. They tell us to ""Be Human"" yet they don't treat us like it."
bad,"If you're not eyeing for a management position in this company,  then I would NOT recommend working at Best Buy longer than you need to. Personally,  if it takes longer than a year to reach that goal within the company then consider getting out  FAST. Best Buy is a typical retail work environment. Expect to be working outside of your job code often. Expect to work longer hours than scheduled. Expect to be gaslighted by your managers to constantly perform, even when you're surpassing expectations.  Now , of course, these workplace problems will persist even with a leadership role, but at least there will be better incentives and pay. "
bad,"The overall experience of working at a Best Buy rests entirely on the ""leadership"" in the store, and whether or not they conduct their business as they should, or as they choose to. And if you follow the rules when you work for a manager that does not, you are more than expendable."
bad,"Not enough training no place to grow for a better opportunity. One mistake can cause you your job. Have managers who can’t even do the work, but love to teach how to do so."
bad,They don't give enough employee benefits and the time schedules are not managed effectively. They ask for more work than expected.They don't give proper training before the starting day of your work. The people are not friendly and supportive. There is no scope of escalation in position.
bad,"Working at Best Buy is fast paced, keeps you on your toes and you can learn a lot. It is however retail, and falls into some of the same familiar traps that other similar jobs do. Holidays are rough and the scheduling is difficult to say the least, but there are some quality experiences from veteran staff and unique experiences with customers."
bad,Mgmt. only cares about staff members they like otherwise they don't speak to you. Mgmt. does not care about safety as they did not enforce and or resolve safety issues or complaints. Mgmt. stays in office all the time instead of being on the floor. Had numerous customer complaints about management's interaction with them. In-store contests only included certain areas. Did not include operations. No incentive. Morale was extremely low. The tv in the breakroom always had extremely offensive shows playing with very vulgar and offensive language. Management did not care. Would never recommend working there.
bad,Boss was more concerned about what the customer felt then what her employees felt/need. Raises and hires/promotions depended on whether you were friends with the manager. If your someone that doesn't rock the boat you'll do fine.
bad,The company has shifted from being a leader in retail technology to a summer gig for teenagers with little to no knowledge of their positions or what they are selling. There is 0 training for the younger employees with no previous experience or technical knowledge and management does nothing to change this. There is no form up punishment for poor performance so often you find employees laying down in the non public facing areas ignoring responsibilities.
bad,Leadership was misleading on the pay progression and job responsibilities.  This company is very silo driven and setup to keep employees in limited abilities for growth.
bad,"Best Buy is a mixture of good and bad, all in one. With the online world slowly crippling their bottom line, they make quite frequent changes to try to keep up. This includes sales techniques, sales/promotions, policies, etc. Unfortunately, the level at which they execute these changes is poor to not at all and what corporate wants, local management constantly contradicts. Here's a general overview, along with categorized reviews of each part of your work experience here:"
bad,"As a former employee of the Best Buy Canada on Pembina, Winnipeg, MB, I feel compelled to provide feedback on the 3+ years I spent working there. First and foremost, it is important to call attention to the behaviour of the floor leads. It was my daily experience to bare witness to the complete lack of professionalism and constant confrontational style of leadership. This behaviour lead to a poor work environment and diminished team morale on a daily basis. Furthermore, the internal politics that played a role in promoting staff, with particular favoritism towards the Indian employees, was completely unfair and meritless. Lastly, I was routinely hounded by my immediate supervisor to sell Geek Squad services to customers without a commission incentive. Floor leads are only nice to you when you sell services, otherwise your service to customers is not amazing. I personally believe that the way floor leads treated me and if I as an employee gave the same ill treatment to customers for not buying the Geek services, they would never come to Best Buy for shopping. It is also my experience that staff will work harder and provide attention to detail if their efforts are properly rewarded, and so it is my opinion that Best Buy Canada should change this policy going forward."
bad,"In general, retail is a dying industry. Companies, like Best Buy, feign interest in their employees. This never shows up in any tangible way and is more of a poor effort to squeeze more out of their workers."
bad,"The company was a great, but the local management was severely lacking. I have a feeling other locations would have been immensely better. "
bad,"Maybe it was just my store, but management was literally teaching us unethical sales practices. it was all about geek squad and warranties and how to shove it down customer's throat."
bad,There was generally only one person there a day to try and manage both the front desk and repairs in the backroom. I went for two months without being called in because of a scheduling mix up with two department managers.
bad,les journées sont bien structurées et agréables. Les manageurs sont chaleureux.
bad,"Management often gave free products to racist, vulgar, disruptive customers to get them to leave the store rather than confronting the problem through interpersonal communication."
bad,"Horrible management,  no advancement opportunities."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Normal entry level job. I would not try to work there to support a family. Easy job to do in college. They do ask a lot of you for what they pay you. Overall not bad.
bad,"My experience may vary from others, but I was hired on as a truck unloader during the holiday season. Working all night long, some work days went on over 12 hours. Nobody knew my name, everyone mistreated me regularly. Would not do again."
bad,I brought in customers who knew me from Radio Shack and was run down when customers wanted to communicate with me and me alone. The manager who led the charge in this is no loner with the company. He felt 100% close rate was useless if you spent more then 5 min. with a customer.
bad,Management sucks and they abuse your position for example if u work in mobile they want you to help out customers not in your area especially if you speak a different language
bad,Would only recommend for first job and just starting out. Career advancement is very slim. Company has gone thru multiple restructures each time eliminating jobs and lowering the pay scale for hourly employees. In addition eliminating management positions and increasing the amount of direct reports for each management position left.
bad,The Geek Squad Manager was rarely supporting the Geek Squad agents in the precinct because he was regularly on the sales floor. The pay is not in line with the kind of work they expect.
bad,"A typical day at work with Geek Squad customer care consists of assisting clients via phone or escalation. Clients call in for assistance with delivery issues such as appliances damaged on delivery, technical issues experienced with large appliances, wrong appliances delivered, late delivery, and delivery team no call/no shows. Workplace culture needs improvement. Management is very standoffish and at times secretive. Consistently have to pry and question to get answers on changes within the company that will effect work and personal life balance."
bad,"Make no mistake, you are more of a salesman versus an actual technician in this position, and the standard of quality that you are held to, and the stress that brings is not commensurate to the compensation that the company provides you. "
bad,"You learn how to stock items. Ship and receive orders. Unload and load trucks. Scan and change price tags. The Hardest part is the holidays, Black Friday and Back to School weeks are the longest. The management is a bit shaky at 384 but they're good people."
bad,Provides flexibility around school scheduling. Great company to work for while in school. Management helpful and working towards gearing everything around the employee experience.
bad,"Best Buy got rid of so called commission sales, but they replaced it with a questionable scale that judges you purely on sales and docks your hours if you don't succeed. You will compete with your own coworkers for hours. If you want full time work and a steady schedule look elsewhere. Good for kids and brown nosers."
bad,"I'll just give you 2 examples that will speak for themselfs,a co-worker and my self. I was a team leader and my coworker was working under my supervision. We were the 2 top employees in sales and bestbuy credit card applications in our store and at some point in the district getting recognitions from above for being part of a selective group of employees who achieved this goals, my self specifically was able to make it top 100 employees in the district with sales over 1million dollars and that being already a team leader, which means in  I interact less with customers since I used to focus more on having the floor ready,clean all products in working order and training whenever possible.my coworker quit because they wouldn't give him li a $1 raise,I mean you can't give your best guy a 1 dollar raise? My self well I got laid off after some chances in the company and was not even given an option for some of the new management position, instead they hire some guy from mattress one who lastest 6 months, didn't show up on black Friday to work and walk away one day to never come back,and that was a guy they decided to hire under the new plan instead of going with someone like me with experience within the company already and with great results,and why well because my manager was useless and always jealous that employees will llfollow me me but not him,off course I was always a role model since day one always achieved results and even told my managers in their faces whenever they were doing something wrong,this they never liked hence the reason why I got no support from them ever.when"
bad,"Very gossip-y and clique-ish which was unprofessional from the get-go. Everyone talks about each other and I felt like I was in high school all over again. Very passive-aggressive employees and would go behind your back and tattle to your manager if they had an issue with you instead of telling you to your face. Ridiculous hours they want you to give up your life for a part time position. I did enjoy the discounts though and bonuses though, which it appears they are now doing away with."
bad,The store could be empty and the manager could still take upwards of 15 minutes to walk over after you call them for keys over the radio. All this time the customer is getting annoyed at you and it isn't even something that you can control.
bad,"The days were pretty slow. Management wasn't that great and definitely had ""favourites"". Culture was awesome for awhile until strange things happened and the place just became an annoyance."
bad,Made this company over 4 million dollars by myself in sales and they never promoted me to a manager in the three years i worked there. They always seemed to know my personal life and that was the reason i never got promoted is because i was dating someone in the store.
bad,"The job was pretty good, lots of fun people... During the slow season there was nothing much to do, which resulted in a lot of pointless work. The majority of management were good."
bad,The Companies goal and ethics are spot on and the way they compensate there employees is great. Though in our store leadership is questionable with their ethics. I would not recommend working in the warehouse as they are treated the worst while expected of the most.
bad,"people really have trouble using a computer nevermind using the programs and all the other overhead that comes with them. Thats what they need people like us for to help them figure out where there start button is, and why thier email keeps asking for there password."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"You will be oppressed by management for their benefit. As with any corporation. I busted my hump for the company to the point of a back injury. After the injury persisting, I attempted to move to a less physically strenuous position. I was twice denied, for those positions, so my boss could pad his resume. In hindsight I should have followed through with HR and received adequate compensation for my injury."
bad,"I’ll start with all the managers were friendly. The other members of the team were friendly and for the most part fun to be around. Overall though, if you’re not full-time at best buy, and it’s your only job, you’re going to struggle if you have regular bills to pay. The amount of work you put in with general upkeep of the store, product/services knowledge, and all these other daily goals to hit, you are not nearly compensated enough in relation to how much money you make the business. Managers love mentioning the bonus structure so you’re inclined to perform well, but the bonus is usually 5% IF YOU HIT, and then the bonus is QUARTERLY. Dead end job and managers/supervisors have hardcore favoritism."
bad,"If you're a student, this is a nice job to have. It will teach you how to work with all sorts of managers, co-workers and customers. In that way it is character building."
bad,"In management, your work/life balance is non-existent.  Esp during peak seasons including holidays (80 hour work weeks). "
bad,"Easy jobs, but if your a good worker expect to do other peoples work."
bad,"Best Buy No Work life Balance for the managers the hours are terrible, the company is constantly doing reorganizations which causes personnel to look for new positions in company unexpectedly."
bad,"My first real job. The place was usually understaffed. Some managers were alright, some were overbearing. GM was a decent guy. Worked in Inventory and we were always overworked."
bad,"Don't expect to have a set schedule, consistent hours, or the ability to get another part time job in order to help pay your bills. They expect you to have wide open availability, but you may only get scheduled for 10 hours in a week."
bad,"The work at Best Buy is not bad by any means as well as the pay for similar work in the retail industry, but management was continually an issue regardless of the locations and the different managers that would be filtered through within a year or so."
bad,"I don't feel I spent enough time working for this company to effectively provide an accurate review for this company, as anything I was exposed to was short term."
bad,"Benefits are good, the discounts are good, the only chance you ever have to move up in the company is if someone gets fired or quits, managers are based out of Denver and rarely have any idea what's going on locally."
bad,Their is alot wrong with this company.  I worked there a long time and made well over every quota I had and was passed over for full time positions by external applicants because they knew the store manager. I was also sexually harassed and stalked by an employee and he was promoted to manager. This place needs to get their priorities straight.
bad,"Typical retail, if you've worked retail before you know what that means; lots of politics and clicky, immature people.  On the plus side having to aggressively approach customers greatly helped me, as a nervous highschooler, to come out of my shell."
bad,"Very laid back and chill except around holidays . It’s not much to do but stand around until someone comes into the line. I try to keep myself busy by vacuuming, cleaning up on my down time"
bad,"Not a super place for anyone to work for extended periods of time. Occasionally gave bonuses if you could bribe your friends to work there, but the support from managers and more knowledgeable agents is almost non-existent. No way to message your manager or higher ups, had to put people on hold and run around the call center until you could find someone to help you. Tell a supervisor they need to take an escalated call and they throw a fit and desperately try to get out of it."
bad,"as an employee, when i first started working there i thought it was great. but you slowly get your eyes opened up to what it really is as you try to seek advancement. "
bad,"I can only speak to my location, but I sadly cannot speak well of it. Managers were corrupt and known to be stealing from the company. They would abuse power against employees and show favoritism, even towards employees caught sneaking service plans onto customer purchases when said customers had already refused the offer. I'm hesitant to mention this, but truthfully at my location, the store manager was known for controversial opinions about race."
bad,"Best Buy typical day involves the associates hearing the numbers and goals.Each store has a credit card goal and and a total tech support goal. Best Buy calls this blue member orange member.  Once the day starts employees are to push credit card apps on everyone who enters the store because the store gets 200 dollars towards daily sales goal for each app. Next is the push for total tech support since this is pure profit for the store.  "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Pagan demasiado poco home delivery de aplliances y instalaciones 150 al día sin ningún beneficio
bad,"Under Staffed not enough training  and managment was never consistent, long hours with no one local to help with questions and no one ever knew how to fix problems"
bad,Customers was awesome but staff had no manners or respect for others. Management was sleeping around with other workers and favoritism started. It wasn't a happy environment to work in.
bad,"This place is ok to work for if your looking for a stepping stone to learn more about technology. Meeting certain people was always nice. Other then that the management had no clue what was ever going on and couldn't care about employees. I heard a boss tell another employee that they are a dime a dozen and can be replaces when ever they feel like they want to, so overhearing makes you second guess how the treat one another. I wouldn't wish this on anyone and would tell someone if they respect themselves then better go someplace where they can move up the latter and be trained correctly."
bad,"Found out I made significantly less than other employees in the same department as me. Schedule would change without warning and you are expected to come in last minute. Worked double shifts often due to call out. Cannot sit as a cashier( imagine standing for 8 hours straight) and breaks are not guaranteed. Gets boring quickly but, good way to make quick cash if your desperate. Some of the management was great while others were terrible. Customers can be a handful but, that's expected in retail."
bad,Long hours. No breaks. Don't even try calling in sick even if its your newborn baby. Its a retail job. You get a good discount on a lot of stuff and that's about the only upside.
bad,"Decent place to work if you can get up the chain fast. Otherwise retail will eat your soul. You have to be able to work without praise and just be happy to do your job. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed."
bad,was working with a cult...people don't think for themselves they follow the cool aid ...they rarely accept outsiders in .the business especially if you come from a competitor
bad,great starter job if interested in electronics and customer service. has a good discount for employees and new product coming in on a regular basis to become familiar with.
bad,"It was ok, bad management. I would highly recommend going into sales rather than working in the warehouse unless you absolutely hate dealing with customers."
bad,"The workplace itself placed a lot more pressure on selling and upselling than they did on their actual core values. They worried more about what we did to sell more, rather than how we got the customer exactly what they NEEDED."
bad,Not much different than most corporations. Follow the guidelines and you will be just fine. Company goes through a lot of managers and has an excessive amount of executives who all have their own agenda. Stores run just fine with direction from General Manager of the store but corporate management often comes in and causes stores to go off of plan to meet their own goals which doesn't  usually help the overall store plan.
bad,management needs improvement. Trust the process. Opportunities were only available to those that were friends outside of work. A little favoritism happens a lot throughout this company.
bad,This is a ok job  needs to pay alittle more and needs to give better discount  it’s clean and very busy during the holidays you get to see all the new electronics
bad,"stressful work environment- management does not care about employees- very goal oriented company, goals set too high to be achieved. No employee retention policies- high turnaround"
bad,The Burbank branch of Best Buy is poorly managed by sycophants who would rather push you down for their own personal gain than help you advance in the company.
bad,"Horrible Work/Life Balance"
bad,"I was only working at best buy for the money. besides the money I made real great friends that I don't even hang out with anymore unfortunately. some days a shift was super busy and then it would die down and some days it was slow the whole shift. the managers were always pushing you to run credit card applications and sometimes the situation didn't feel right to ask and at times a manager would stand behind you while you were ringing up a transaction to make sure you asked the question. it was annoying at times. I haven't worked there since 2013, so I don't know how much things have changed, but I still keep in contact with two former co-workers and they still dislike working there. so I guess that tells you how it's like to work there. they both say it's dead end unless you move to management."
bad,"This is an alright temp job but if you're looking for a career, you need to have a manager or higher position. It's a fine place to learn a lot of different skills. The cons are just going to outweigh the pros."
bad,"seen a lot of employees come and go because of not feeling valued. Management picks their favorites, and is very clear that the rest of the employees are disposable."
bad,"It was a casual work place, except for black friday! that is by far the hardest part of working at best buy.  Some Managers were on the ball and awesome but others were just terrible. Awesome coworkers and always cool things to learn about."
bad,"You could not work at a more convenient place if your a gamer, great discounts if you are an employee. However if your not good looking then sales is not for you."
bad,"A few employees who will remain nameless had some mental breakdowns so the manager thought making the break room more inviting might cheer people up, however, they took away the tv and put all the tables together. So it forced us to sit really close to people. I don't feel comfortable going to the break room to eat anymore so most days i eat in my car. Most people eat in their cars now as well. I worked at best buy for almost a year and a half and still haven't received full time. Full time is the main reason i left my previous job. I have too many bills to not have insurance. So I'm currently looking for another job."
bad,"Best Buy has an all push no gratitude culture. You will constantly hear sales targets blaring in your ear, and an unending push to sell their latest warranty program. Plenty of sales jobs provide at least a little commission, especially phone sales, but here you get nothing. I would only work here for the experience."
bad,"Best Buy is not a company you should want to work for. A typical day of work was walking around trying to sell people items and equipment they didn't need. There is no training, just kids thrown onto the floor. Almost all, if any, information given to you is to try and make you buy more. I was one of the honest people who worked for the store and it really drove me crazy how much they wanted you to lie to customers. "
bad,"I really enjoyed working with the customers at best buy. Finding them solutions to their entertainment and electronic needs was fantastic. However the corporate culture at the time was poor, and there was a significant drive to up-sell overpriced insurance schemes on all of my products. I got absolutely fantastic customer reviews, but was considered to be a poor performer because I had a tendency to sell Tech Support and physical addons instead of the insurance, which I knew to be a bad deal and had some moral issues with."
bad,"employees werent as welcoming or supportive, on a thin line every shift due to mistakes will be punished. hard to book off work for important days. not as supportive"
bad,"BestBuy offer the employees good discounts.  BestBuy will work with your school schedule.  They do not offer much advancement for  part time  work, so might remain in the same position for awhile."
bad,"The overall job was good & my co-workers were great. Management however, was not. Too much favoritism & disrespect to employees. The managers I had previously started with were amazing very helpful but once they transferred, I ended up with the most horrible management."
bad,"The best part of my job was the peers I worked with. We tried to motivate, train and be supportive of one another and help each other achieve our best. While the coworkers were enthusiastic and welcoming the management were demanding, judgmental, and not understanding."
bad,"Best Buy houses an extremely ""me"" based environment. There is no ""team"" as much as they'd like to create the illusion of one. Management is unfocused and has no interest in actually creating a better environment for employees or guests."
bad,"It has been years, the Geek Squad role back then allowed for a fair amount of automation. More than a few paths for continuing education and skills to gain."
bad,if you want to drone around all day fighting for customers and numbers this is the place for you. The management changed 3 times while I was underemployment. You are constantly busy covering for the floor managers and their friends while they frequently abandon their job and consumers. the sales employees are more equipped to run the store than the management.
bad,"Poor management technique, was not given compensation that was promised. Dead end job. When i asked why compensation was so far off they said its fine and i would receive bonuses. Later found out i was not going to get any due to my position."
bad,"If you like electronics, you will love this job. There is a lot of information you will learn about the latest technology. enjoyed workin in customer service."
bad,"Managment undermines you, clients always yell at you, and other employees outside of Geek squad dont know anything about you. It seems that because geeksquad is more intensive then selling, no one wants to learn it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I was on board as a Lifestyles representative for a temporary position. As such, I was unable to build a relationship with my manager, my team, or the company, so my opinion is of little consequence."
bad,"You work 10-12 hour days, sometimes six days a week.  Stuck once you get to lower management because you will be passed over for a friend of the leader or someone from Target. It's always an outside hire."
bad,"If you wish to move up there needs to be a lot of brown nosing. There are cliques within the store who team up and do not do much work, forcing the other staff to pick up their slack asked by management but nothing was ever done about it even with reports."
bad,Typical sales position that paid very little. Tried to work for Geek Squad but no room for advancement and the pay was very little. Would not suggest working here.
bad,Ensured all associate had assignments and executed before store opened. Hardest part of the job was being able to get a break as sometimes I was the only manager in the store. Most enjoyable part being the first to see the latest in technology.
bad,"A normal day would consist of trying to increase sales for not just the store, but also your numbers for ""warranties"" and services being sold. You had to hit certain numbers every month and that is all they cared about. Management wasn't very good, they would always try to avoid making contact with any customers and if they did they would simply pass it on to anyone to avoid interactions. Managers would mainly just sit at their department and watch people get their numbers for them and would not help when needed."
bad,"Doing more with less has always been the motto for every retail company I have ever worked for.  Sad to say, that motto is not exempt from Best Buy.  "
bad,At many times I felt I was training myself and had very little to any supervision. It could have just been the busy season. However it was very clear that there was no regard to the seasonal employees and they were just waiting out the time until we were gone.
bad,Advancement in this company is not based on merit. It's based mostly on whether or not your boss likes you more than everyone else. Under-qualified employees get put into positions they cannot handle almost all the time.
bad,The best thing about Best Buy would be the discount that you receive. Although it doesn’t apply to everything you are getting merchandise at cost for them.
bad,General manager didn't talk to any of the employees when I was there the only thing he had tome to do was sit in his office then go out side for a smoke break
bad,They will work you for little pay and always be ready for a restructure.
bad,"Constant layoffs and piling more responsibility on the middle management for the same pay.  Upper management only care about bonuses and have clue to how things operate ""on the ground"" or on site."
bad,"I worked for this company in several locations over a five year period. Hard work and dedication will not be rewarded in any tangible way. "
bad,Best buy is a great place to work for the most part. Sometime you have days where no one walks into the store and it becomes a very long day. Overall a retail job is great to have in your belt.
bad,The job is all about the numbers and data. People are last. They don't care about the customer or employees. Only the final digits and percentages matter.
bad,"Bad Management, Bad pay, Bad hours, Bad company, It was very unhealthy to work in such a horrible demeaning place. Retail company's are going to be a thing of the past because they hire unqualified people to work because they cant pay their staff enough to live on."
bad,Not somewhere to make a long term career out of but it was a decent job. You work long hard hours some times and then you're lucky if you get 8 hours.
bad,The company is too huge to care about any of the employees in the slightest bit. They're failing worse and worse every year and because of this they inflict bizarre and stupid changes on the staff on a quarterly basis.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Best Buy DC does not have much growth in the HR department. There are more positions back east. I wanted to pursue a career in HR and not willing to take another posiiton.
bad,"I was good at my job, above average compared to other employees, and management just wants more  and more without compensating you. Employees that were under performers where not told anything. I had nightmares about not being able to leave work."
bad,"Bad, I would not work here. stressful work and on top of it the customers often treat you very badly. You work on pretty much all holidays and it was hard to get time off."
bad,easier job in the building except perhaps if one does not have the knowledge of nearly every department in the store. Over the phone you are the 1st contact for the store. you have to be able to answer questions other associates sometimes do not want to deal with. be ready
bad,Too many managers who can't handle the stress. They want to yell instead of talking to you like an adult. Accuse you of lying when they change the schedule after you've printed it. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Two managers telling you to do two different things.
bad,Nothing taken seriously in my position as asset protection. CCTV out of date. Employees allowed in so called asset protection room. Missing keys. Broken radios.
bad,"On the phone talking with customers was a typical day at work. I learned better time management and communication. Management was okay, but not the best. Workplace culture was there, but not that good. The hardest part of the job was managing the work load. The most enjoyable part were the customers."
bad,Great first job for teens. Great discounts for those who enjoy electronics and home appliances. The problem with all of this is the culture of selling even though it is not a commission based business.
bad,you get good breaks. customers always right. pay is great depends on what department you are in. fun and great place to work. you learn and lot of things with technology of the world no matter what department you are in.
bad,"It was cool to work there but I never got enough hours, it was a minute drive everyday to work and I could never get enough hours to match my commute and the manager did not care at all."
bad,At first when I was hired I enjoyed my leadership . Certain employees were told to call a certain number and the ones that did there position was terminated. As what was done to myself . You plan on spending your life with a Company and they treat you like that.
bad,"I've been with Best Buy/Geek Squad for 10 years. Started out loving my job and the company. Employee discount is the best you'll find anywhere. You do get a lot of PTO as a full time employee. They used to emphasize ""have fun while being the best."" That's not the case anymore. Management is a joke anymore. Corporate has a way of making things even worse when they put their nose where it doesnt belong. For the most part, they care for their clients. But you as an employee, not at all. There's no loyalty or respect. It's like high school all over again. If you need a part time holiday job, take advantage of the discount. Otherwise, avoid this company."
bad,working at Best Buy Is a fun place to work. it can become very stressful during holiday season but the pay is not much. the employee discount off products is nice.
bad,Fast past environment not organized. Harassment by customers and coworkers. Stressful long work days.  It helped me gained a lot of experience and learning to work under pressure.
bad,"I worked at the Reynoldsburg location. the management was unkind and unwilling to work with you, would claim to get you more hours then cut your hours in half. management was angry and threw fits at one point the supervisor threw all of our chairs from the warehouse in the compactor."
bad,"Good wages, but bad management. It was good at the beginning, but quickly turned bad. Managers care more about selling than their employees. If you're good at selling, you will be good."
bad,a lot of work for a low wage.  I felt as if there was no room for growth in this establishment. You have to meet quotas with no commission. My manager was unfair.
bad,Pretty standard part time hourly work. Starting pay is lower than most and raises are inconsistent and unclear on how and when they occur. Very slow paced. Advancement is difficult. Hours fluctuate wildly.
bad,Hours varied week to week so having a life was difficult. Sales was pushed hard despite no commision. Always under the threat of dismissal if sales numbers were not met. Meeting new people and educating them on the various technologies was the best part.
bad,A perfect job for a full-time college students but besides that I wouldn't work there. Their system is gear toward you working every holiday and not being fully compensated for the amount of effort provided by their employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"This business likes to run as thin as possible. Hours are thin and often times you do not get a lunch or break; when you ask for one you are met with disapproving looks and ""we do not have enough people to cover your lunch/break"". training is the worst part. everything is done via modules online."
bad,I will never work retail again. They always had unrealistic sales goals. I felt like they pressured you to sale to the customers to much. If somebody was looking at a Samsung TV. They want you to try and get them to buy a Samsung phone as well. It was to much.
bad,"overall the company needs to be better m very high turnover rate of employees and management seems to be chosen due to favoritism , and not by who is qualified to do the job"
bad,This was a great place to work for. The general manager was not easy to work for a lot of employees quit they lost a lot of excellent works. I was promoted 2 times when I worked yhere.
bad,This was a fast paced environment and they did not give everyone chance to learn everything that was required. I don't think that I was treated fairly at this job.
bad,This job laid off a lot and job The job security was not good at all. They pay was not that good and management was all over the place. I met some nice people there however
bad,"Too many decisions are made that contradict themselves later. "
bad,"A typical day starting out is sitting in front of a computer ""learning"" about every single department of the store whether you work in it or not. After that, they'll rush you out on the floor with 0 preemptive knowledge of your actual job, they'll settle on your department whenever they see fit and will randomly change it on you. Applied for one position, hired as another, worked as something totally different."
bad,"Ropes you in with decent pay and benefits, brainwashes you with culture, and then drops decades of talent every year with their annual restructures. Cuts entire departments to outsource, and de-layers yearly to save a few dollars on the bottom line while piling up more and more work on the ones 'spared'."
bad,"A day of the salesman will start off by grabbing a clipboard and walking around making sure customers are being helped. When its dead (the entire summer) you clean, we have janitors but they'll make you clean instead. Majority of my coworkers are friendly most actually being high school students because no one with any actual experience on how a business should be ran lasts long. The General manager frequently engages in shady business practices such as forcing people to quiet by cutting hours down or just flat out saying i accept your resignation, most are too fed up or afraid to fight it. also if your a student expect to be paid far less than even a newer untrained regular employee, full time or not."
bad,"the job has some frustrating times, especially around the holidays (christmas, black friday, etc). The store I worked in fell victim to alot of theft leading to constant management turnover."
bad,"Management changed hands so much it was had to tell who was in charge most of the time. Questions about the workplace or job-related questions were usually shrugged off or ignored. If you caught a manager right, you would get an ear-full about ""incompetent employees"" and ""need to read the handbook"". Training for each position was lengthy but left more questions than answers. The workload was heavy and managers were loath to help, preferring to hide in the office away from customers and employees. The employees themselves were wonderfully pleasant and very helpful. If you had a question, there were certain employees you could speak to who would be happy to help and also train. Customers were pleasant to some degree unless it was the holidays. I learned quite a bit about computer technician and assembly work at this location."
bad,Fort gratiot Best Buy is run by petty management who limit the growth of the employees. Don't work here. There is a high turnover rate. The Detroit metro Best Buy's have more room for growth. If you have any ambition don't work here. You will get stuck here.
bad,If you want stress and your job threatened on an almost daily basis by all means work here. The turnover in this store is so bad you might as well not learn any names. They change your duties so fast you can't keep up and put an overwhelming amount of work on you in a very short period of time. Its almost like they want you to fail. It really comes down to a choice the customers or duties. If you think the choice is customers..you'd be wrong.
bad,It was an interesting environment to work in. I enjoyed it and I am happy I gave it a try. it definitely helped me out starting at the mobile shop there in the future.
bad,This was a very entry level type sales job. Employees were paid hourly so there was very little incentive to sell/up-sell the customer. Team moral was low which made getting things done difficult.
bad,"Management wanted you to make sales goals every day, but there wasn't any extra incentive. Best Buy did not care about the customers needs, only what you could push them into buying."
bad,Quise ser full tomé pero desgraciadamente​ nunca me dieron la oportunidad
bad,"There are only a couple good reasons to want to stay at this place, and they aren't really worth saying all that much. You will find out that the upper leadership doesn't really know what they are doing and they use favoritism way more than it appears at first."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"If you're into fast paced work and don't mind stress from time to time, Best Buy would be a nice company for you.  You have to be very knowledgeable about the products and services they offer."
bad,It's not as bad but can be better. Working there has taught me a lot about selling and the right things to say to the customers. Best Buy also helped further grow my customer service experience
bad,"I worked for Best Buy for a few months and it was OK. I didn't really like the people i worked with, they weren't very helpful or friendly. I like helping customers but all i did was stock shelves."
bad,This was a good place for me to building my customer service skills. I use to be shy so this helped a lot with networking and being able to work on my professional skills.
bad,"Pay is capped"
bad,"I liked it for about a few months, but there was no room for promotion, and they took advantage of their part-time employees. I was always on my feet and dealing with people that were convinced that I was lying to them. I was under a lot of pressure to sell, and there were no commissions from it. I would have made thousands a month if I was allowed to make a commission off of my sales, but the store only raised my pay from 9.75/hr to 10.15/hr over a year and a half. I was taken advantage of all of the time because they knew that I was scared of getting fired."
bad,"Management is will say to focus on the customer experience but then will reprimand you for not making the sale fast enough or if the sale is not what the mangers are expecting. "
bad,The job itself was in front of customers all day long.  Interacting with the customers and programming phones all day long.  They give you no incentive to work harder or to achieve higher goals.
bad,The culture can become frustrating as the company is constantly changing their policy and systems week to week in order to try and compete in an uphill battle with online retailers.  These changes are not communicated very well through management which is on a six month turnover rate.  The constant changes in policy and management make it difficult for the low level employees to gain any sort of ground or advance through the company.
bad,constant restructure cause demtoions and job loss enjoyed the job however management was always pushing for more revenue even if you shatter goals it was never enough
bad,"At first I thought that this would be a good place, but I realized that eventually you as employee were just a number bringing in a certain amount of dollars every hour. If you didn't hit the revenue target, then you were cut. I fortunately did not have to experience this but I saw many of my co-workers getting in trouble for things like lack of customers and poor scheduling in shifts, as this translated to poor sales on their part. When you ask the management how to improve, they just reiterate the stuff you learn in the very poor quality training videos. Basically this is not good, only apply here if you are in high school as it is easy pocket cash. Other than that its a pretty bad place to work"
bad,"This was my first job but retail wasn't for me. If you like dealing with demanding customers and selling then this job would be great. You learn how to sale thends value of a product and that can transition into other sales jobs,"
bad,It's retail.  You get to help customers with whatever they are looking for.  Try to stop returns and up sell services.  Just don't work the customer service line.
bad,"I don't have much to say except that management was very unfair. the job in itself was good, when you stay to yourself. But sometime trouble comes to find you sadly. Its an alright place to work if you really need a job."
bad,management was always and power trips and came down hard on employees. Could never do anything right. each day was a new start which was bad. very political and mostly men
bad,"Working there was a great opportunity to acquire a great technological skill set. While working there, I learned how to work with computers, laptops, tablets, cameras, TV's, car stereos, game consoles, etc. I made sure to learn everything I could about all of the products they sell because I knew it would be useful information for the rest of my life. I've also had the opportunity to meet and work with some of the greatest people, many of which I am still friends with. "
bad,"Lots of things to invest money in and learn about, but discount and management can be very difffucult to work with depending on how well there day goes"
bad,"No professionalism whatsoever, dirty, mis-behaved employees and managers. Learned how to handle large amounts of money. only positive thing"
bad,i made some good contacts along the way  learned new systems and equipped myself with nw ways on how to do about certain things on the flip side i can say the schedule changes and not having dependable management can make the work place difficult when  u your managers dont even know the job that they are being asked to perform.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Working for Best Buy has been one of the most depressing periods of my life. Coming into Best Buy, you feel like everything is going to be great. They claim to have such great values, and their policies make them seem like you'll never have any problems, and if you do, they'll jump right on it. But they don't care about anybody not in a management position. Their policies are just words to them, they do not follow them. Management is corrupt, and HR doesn't protect anybody unless they are legally obliged by equal opportunity laws. policies are not enforced unless somebody who can claim to be a minority is offended, an authority witnesses something, or the company is being stolen from. They only care as far as keeping up appearances. They do not think of the lives their employees have outside of work, and they schedule people however works for them, even if it means you only see your family/residence 2 months out of the year and every couple of weekends. Benefits are decent, but will only help you after things have happened, they do not cover or help preventative care or check ups. Management is great at pretending to be friendly, but if you need something personnel-related from them, you will be assured and then ignored completely."
bad,I've been at Best Buy for over a year now and I can say I made a mistake on leaving my other job at this place. The management here is one of the worst. I would not recommend this for anyone.
bad,"A long time ago, over a decade ago, I used to work here. I'm sure it has changed over the years, but it's a great place to purchase the latest technology at an affordable price."
bad,"Never enjoyed working until I moved to the warehouse department as an Merchandising specialist under the only manager in the store who actually had good work ethic and cared about customers and treated each of their employees fairly. "
bad,I don't remember much details but I just remember not really enjoying the stress involved with the job. I didn't learn much because I had already learned how to multitask at my previous job. Black Friday was difficult at this job. I worked a 17 hour shift straight with only 2 lunches and 3 breaks on my first black Friday and nearly lost my mind.
bad,"I was a seasonal worker that showed the most product knowledge, sales, and initiative to help customers. I was let go at the end of the seasonal period, which i have no regrets for since i went on to make more money with a different company,"
bad,This company left me with a bad taste about how management will give you hope on moving up just to get their motives completed.
bad,Best Buy is a good place for temporary work means. You will learn a lot of skills especially customer service oriented skills. I definitely have developed as a person and employee while at Best Buy. Management could absolutely be better
bad,Hard work does not pay off with this company but still holds hope after several years of leading by example.  Best Buy won't even provide cable for the employee break room.  Flavor of the month metrics.
bad,"If you want to feel as if you're back in high school then this is the place for you! Even the managers are in on the drama, it's a bunch of ""he-said she-said""."
bad,"When I stepped foot into the Pinole location it wasn't the greatest but over time while I worked there I helped my store grow to be a better store. I got more hours than I wished and it was great. Typical day starts relatively steady and during the afternoon rush hours it would get busy but with a great team we were able to pull it off 100% of the time. Even if there were times where Geek Squad wouldn't have anyone at our counters, the management team will always try to respond as quickly as possible while they're running around the store assisting customers and employees."
bad,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you are in school or seeking to better yourself. Workload is okay, discount is fair at times, but management is where the company lacks."
bad,"working with your coworkers are great and always a blast but , management is after numbers and stats and could careless about job advancement of their employees"
bad,I love technology but unfortunately I had a no supportive management team. It felt like I woke up to expect a battle at work everyday and full time was not an option.
bad,The job was nice and easy but for what you have to deal with the pay wasn't worth it. But I depends on what department you are working at. For me i was in computer sales but they have you working every where over time with no raise.
bad,"Management didn't live up to the expectations that were expected. "
bad,"Too much favoritism, not concerned with employees needs. Would like to see more appreciation towards employees. Management is very poor."
bad,"Not so much, fun work pay was bad, benefits was bad. Managers all had GED's apparently...They knew about as much about the company as I did just starting off."
bad,"The Geek Squad service center used to be a great place to work. When I first started, I was an innovative thinking, always trying to come up with ideas to make things better and more efficient. But you can only take so much of management dumping on you before you no longer feel like going above and beyond for them. One of their ""values"" is ""Have Fun While Being The Best"". We used to be able to do that. Not so much any more."
bad,Great benefits but Stressful environment.Best Buy is Good for retail Learning.Good for part time.Work in Geek Squad if you can't get job at any other place.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Good place to start if you are a student. Some management at store levels are willing to work with you on flexibility of work and school schedule. Good place to gain knowledge of electronics if starting out with limited or no experience.
bad,"They are not concerned about keeping staff and have high turn over rates with little concern of how hard they work you or if they let you go because they can replace you. Can be very stressful, as any retail position, but good learning environment"
bad,At the time Best Buy had great training and cared about their employees.  Now they are only caring about the numbers.  Little pay for the job that you do.
bad,when i first started working for the company.. but it seems as of late the values of the company have gone south. its a good retail job but i would not recomend staying there ver ylong
bad,"A daily working day at this job does vary greatly some days can be extremly busy to the point of not being able to get a lunch brake (not that management seem to mind this) to being extremly boring and having nothing to do all day. The amount of variation in tasks is not great finding that many days seem to end up like ground hog day performing the same tasks in similar situations but for different customers...in some cases the same customers! Relations between other member of the stores is good finding a good team can break the boredom of your day having a good laugh and joke around. Management are happy for you to have a chat and a joke as long as it is not massively effecting your roles or the customers in store, but be prepared that they will crack the whip at a minutes notice. On some days this can be a stark contrast to previous days of it being a very relaxed atmosphere feeling like management is on your back 24/7. A good team to work with on some days is the only reason I actually went into work. Hardest part of the job is delaing with customers who have purchased an extremly advanced and techniquel mobile but have no idea on how to use it and for the most part do not want to know yet expect you to pardon their stupidity and complete lack of knowlegde for the product they have just bought. On some days this made life very difficult trying to explain and fix the problem when the customer who has just asked what has happened to their device and why it is not performing as they expected has zero idea on how to use it for more than a call or text message. In some cases this"
bad,"This company does not have much for their employees as far as growth goes. It was hard to move up in the company, let alone get a respectable raise to not live paycheck to paycheck. if you're working here you most likely are working somewhere else to make the bills for the month"
bad,Management failed to adhere to the company standards of policy for safety and shrink procedures.  Forms were ignored and behind by several months.
bad,"Standard entry level sales position, very little room for growth no matter the experience or qualifications. Poor work incentive and no bonus program available."
bad,Company has opportunity for greatness. Corporate higher ups need to be more involved in decisions and work/life culture
bad,"Focused on sales. Lots of stuff to play with. Pushy credit sign up  systems. Overall, I would work here again as part time."
bad,promotion is more about who you know and not what you can show you have accomplished or learned.  A game of politics to say the least and getting time off is next to impossible
bad,Started as a Part-Time associate. Worked quite hard to achieve high revenue and customer service. Lead Team of associates. Lead in Sales. Refused to consider raise or promotion without proper reasoning. Immature management staff
bad,Working at Bestbuy was amazing. i LOVED THE MANAGEMENT TEAM EVERYONE HELPED EACH OTHER OUT. ALL THE EMPLOYEES GOT REWARDED FOR THE GOOD WE HAD DONE.
bad,Some of the worst management I have ever seen. Very pushy and do not care for their employees at all. The only benefit from that job was that I made good friends.
bad,"No place for anyone over 18. This place is the Mcdonalds of the electronics industry. WIll make you miss Circuit City. Save the trip buy your TV from Amazon, save yourself about 2 steak dinners at your local steakhouse, if you're a drinker, that translates to about 12, 12 packs."
bad,"It is a good place to work. There is a game room, free hot beverages and a lot more. There are some good co-workers there. There are a lot to learn."
bad,Greeted customers as they came into the store and as they exited. Assisted customers with locating items inside the store. Completed inventory checks as requested by management. Monitored the on site camera system and checked receipt's upon customers exit.
bad,overall not my favorite place to work . company has struggled new management in place not sure how it has changed. choosing best buy today could be different.
bad,"I worked above and beyond for this company with promises of fair compensation, that were never fulfilled. Advancements structured as if they are important but for extremely weak pay. An employee that will make a good leader cannot support their family for barley over minimum wage."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I only worked there for the thanksgiving and christmas holiday season and it was ok, however management doesn't seem to help in almost anyway and just wants results."
bad,"A lot of people seem to like working there, but it definitely takes a certain type of personality. You need to be pretty outgoing, able to handle a busy environment, and able to learn and keep up with a ton of information in a short amount of time. If you can't do even one of these things well, the job will be torture for you--especially if you're in sales--and you will not keep your job or get very many hours. Even if you can do these things, you have sales quotas to meet if you're in sales. If you don't, your hours will be reduced or you will be removed from the schedule completely as they keep hiring new people. Some of the areas of BB seem understaffed, too, like Geek Squad and the Computer Sales areas, and this adds extra stress in those areas--especially since a lot is expected from these two areas and they both tend to be among the busiest."
bad,"I am the primary point of contact for Geek Squad and all customer service needs, I handled returns, exchanges, trade-ins, recycling, defective products and repair questions. I explained Geek Squad Service offerings and ensured every customer was thoroughly helped. I was acknowledged for providing excellent customer service and for maintaining a positive attitude."
bad,"I worked for Best Buy about two months, I let a manager on duty I couldn't work certain days, only to find out from the store manager I was up for termination. They claimed they called but never got a missed call or a voicemail. I tried to put in an HR request with no success. I asked could I submit call records, but it was denied, I'll be going to a higher power about this. Hardly got no hours, one week I didn't even get any, claiming they forgot. Very unorganized."
bad,"The job itself is fairly easy, but the management generally has no idea what IT is or what you're doing, the pay is terrible, and I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"The job started out being fun and educational.  Once I had taken all the eLearning courses and got Gold Certified, there wasn't much room to grow.  The regional managers promoted and hired their favorite employees to managers, whether they knew how to do the job or not.  Because of that, there was no confidence in certain managers, and turnover was extremely high."
bad,"I still maintain contact with my coworkers from Geek Squad, they are all completely miserable there. The pay was okay, and the work wasn't terribly difficult, but the upper management is atrocious and I can only be glad that I made the leap out before things got any worse than they already were."
bad,"Working at the particular location I work at is not exactly a walk in the park, but it's a job. A day is here what you would expect, help customers and answer questions. However, the hard part is dealing with management, one in particular. This manager is harsh, overbearing and threatening when it comes to keeping up 'regulations' which creates a hostile working environment for me and my co-workers. He claims to be managing us but in reality he is bullying us and because this location is understaffed I personally am not allowed to take 15 minute breaks, most of my co-workers don't either.  My co-workers are friendly and the relationships you form there are great. Me and my co-workers are like a small community of friends, basically like a work family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management, particularly the manager I mentioned above and dealing with unhappy customers when they are unhappy with not a service but with certain products. The most enjoyable part of the job is having co-workers who make you feel like you're a part of a close-knit community."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and having the freedom to roam the store and learn about different departments. The Hardest part of the job is being pressured to hit daily sales goals, because no customer is alike and we see many people who are just browsing. Yes, there are a few that are on the verge of buying and just need a helpful push. The majority of customers who intend to buy have done a little online shopping around first and it is our job to try and overcome any objections and get the sale."
bad,Working for a big retail chain. Great to start off and build interpersonal and customer service skills. Working with a team in one department.
bad,"very busy alot of customer issues never staffed enough"
bad,"The job was very good at the start, part timers had access to full time hours, the management was more hands on and the  corporate  aspects of the job such as meeting certain demands were minimal enough to be understood and clear. Currently the hours have depleted, management is more distant than ever, and The only benefit left is the employee discount. There is also a lot more corporate jargon and more responsibilities such as working various departments, noting every sale in a handbook and not getting enough  hours to meet revenue per hour goals. There is little to no consideration for the employees needs and the management team only cares to praise those who hit revenue and doesn't focus on helping others achieve those goals. The amount of negatives have surpassed the benefits and the pay has drastically decreased due to a lack of hours."
bad,"Overall the job was probably the worst job I have ever worked. Management was clueless about products and all they seemed to be able to say was ""sell, sell, sell"". Hours could vary from 40 one week to less than 20 the next. The only 2 good things about that job were the pay, and the atypical customer whom you could actually talk to about your products and have an actual conversation instead of the typical ""I'm just looking"" type of customer."
bad,I worked here in college and spent most of my paycheck on merchandise sold in the store.  It was a boys club and I felt very out of place as a female.
bad,"Some co-workers are very nice and respectable, and others are just there. Management was stuck up, scoffed at ideas, and often didn't encourage coworker communication. And played favorites."
bad,"Being a cashier representative at Best Buy taught me to learn more customer service skills. It taught me to be patient and that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. It taught me to word my phrases differently in order to satisfy the customer and meet all their needs. It is a good position if you're looking to earn a little extra cash for everyday needs."
bad,"I'll keep this short, sweet, and as real as possible. Best Buy could be fun, it could be a blast, and should be. The fact of the matter is it isn't, and I wanted to love this place, I really did, and for a short period of time it was. Like most things too good to be true, it feel apart rapidly and without warning."
bad,"Being an ARA doesn't save you from having to do retail, which is why I wanted the position in the first place. Even though it's advertised as a technician job, management will force you to the counter to constantly try and sell more services to people who don't need it."
bad,"Fast pace"
bad,"At first this was an exciting place to work for. After a while I hated coming into work.  The pay was awful, I had more responsibilities as a sales leader and some of my employees underneath me made more money than me.  The pay scale was incredibly low. There was no incentives to sell and management was extremely harsh.  The hardest part was dealing with the awful customer that came into the store.  Everyone thinks they are entitled to a discount.  The best part of the job was the discount"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I worked for this company for over five years, and like any job it had it's ups and downs. However, towards the end it did feel like it was more on a downward slope. Rules were put in place that made it hard to have a set work schedule that worked for life outside of the company, and there was no evidence of ability to grow inside of the company."
bad,I have been working at Best Buy for a almost 5 years (every since my junior year in college) and it was great for the first 3 years. Flexible hours and great coworkers. Recently the change in management over the past 2 years haven't been great and the new hires have not done that well either (excluding ONLY a few).
bad,The job is tiresome and demanding. All you do is stand on your feet in one spot looking at the camera.
bad,It was a good place for me to start off and really learn about being  a leader. It helped me develop my skills as a manager and also taught me how to run a business.
bad,Best Buy was a fun place to work the first year. Then it got old. You will not be able to make a living unless you are a manager. During the Holidays the hours are long. Then afterwards they cut the budget and you get very few hours. I really enjoyed the people I worked with but did not like the management style. It was constant pressure selling they treat you like a common sales person when you only make around  $8 a hour or a little more. They are constantly changing things. They want you to know the customer and required you to fill out paperwork after you help each customer find a movie or a TV. This is most likely the reason they are struggling now.
bad,"Typical day is just trying to make sales and adding additional accessories to customers purchases. I learned some new things about merchandise that I had little knowledge of. Management and coworkers alike only help if it is beneficial to them or to meet sales goal. Hardest part of the job is the volume of customers and lack of product knowledge people enter with. I understand the selling aspect of it: informing a customer about a product to ensure they make an educated purchase to make them not feel like they were ripped off or ""talked  into"" purchasing something. Best Buy is all about sales and adding accessories to customers for products that do not require anything else. Most enjoyable part is being around the new merchandise and having first pick on new products."
bad,Not a career choice. Great for younger crowd to make a few bucks and the discounts are amazing.
bad,"Would not work for best buy again, the people are good, however it's a dying company and it shows"
bad,Everyday can be exciting however co-workers can throw off balance by ego and unprofessionalism.
bad,"After several years of working regularly, and missing out on many birthdays, funerals and other life events.  They will use minor attendance violations to oust employees."
bad,"okay place to wotk for, when you need money. Decent Pay, team work atmosphere"
bad,Management was minimal but sufficient. The pressure of failure was evident along with meeting the production quota.
bad,There isn't much to do when people don't have money to buy new phones or upgrade their plans. People don't want to listen to your sales talk.
bad,"If you are full-time then things are better for your than if you are part time. as a part time worker I struggle to get decent hours. I currently am lucky to get 8 hours in a week and was told by a manager that legally he doesn't have to give me any hours as part time worker. they used to be a place that appreciated the hard work or their employees but with the new changes in management it has become a place of disappointment and struggle. A typical day is assisting customers with completing cell phone upgrades and new activations, finding phone accessories, finding the perfect tablet for them and tablet accessories. the best part of my job is interacting with customers and helping them. the worst part of my job is trying to get hours and dealing with the favoritism I notice at the job."
bad,"the people were great, the business approach was not. while I loved doing the work that I was doing, there were too many other issues brought on by the owner and they eventually went out of business"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Wanted all employees to live at work and didn't care much about their life outside of the building.  The money  wasn't so bad for retail but still not good.  Alot of people started getting laid off.  Realized it was time to move on before the lay off's.  Management needed to learn how to be proper managers.  Job culture for the most part was good with employees  The management was the issue with that company.
bad,Management claims to be about the customer experience however the floor might as well be a commissioned based sales environment.  The pressure to sell to the customer instead of creating lasting relationships is overbearing.
bad,"Overall Best Buy is a company that on the store level is often a very positive experience. Customers really are the primary focus from management down to the sales trainee. "
bad,Best Buy has a lot of great ideas but spends too much time talking about them and not enough time implementing key foundational pieces to ensure success and sustainability. This is coming from a store manager.
bad,"As a best buy employee, you will be selling high end electronics. Also, you are not commissioned. You are required to hit high budgets and if you do not they will position you to work less and then devise an elaborate plan to have you step down or transfer departments/stores. Management will not ever once try to help you with sales just regurgitate the sop. So this job is great for those that aren't in it for the long haul. However, there is extremely little advancement and the pay barely above minimum.So I worked as a second job like many of my peers however the stress of little job security did me in. I may proclaim I will not be forceful to customers and you have to push there program garbage on every customer. Your success is 100% up to you."
bad,did not like that when my son got sick I couldn't go home and take care of him. They said I had to work my shift.
bad,"*Customers were sometimes difficult"
bad,Walking through the doors of Best Buy is nothing but positive energy.having fun at work is the best.
bad,"They work off of numbers and do not pay well. They ask a lot from employees with no recognition. management is fickle, some follow rules most do not."
bad,"A typical day at work: Working over time with out compensation, dealing with many management issues and customer complaints."
bad,In Geek Squad where I was working there was no sense of urgency or accountability. Management is okay with hiring non technical staff and sales people to troubleshoot problems. This caused many unecessary problems and make coming into work difficult sometimes. The one thing that is a great benefit is being so close to new technology. If you love tech then this is a great place to see the latest and greatest!
bad,"I have been an employee at Best Buy for a little over half a year now, and I have to say that I am very glad to be leaving this week. This is a company that finds every way possible to not pay it's employees what it owes them. The clocking in and out systems pretty much try to swindle you out of your time by making you manually enter your hours worked and you have to get approval in the system which can be edited or changed by mangers. I worked in the mobile phones section and I have hated pretty much every day working there. You have to deal with legal contracts and binding things without proper training and sometimes you are forced to make decisions that could possibly get you in legal trouble without any help from management. You work with the three top carriers and have to learn every detail about them as if you were the carrier, even though you do not have their authority which causes problems such as having to call them every five minutes because people's phones don't work half the time. Positions are hourly, yet you are forced to sell and attach insurance plans like you make comission without any proper compensation. You are expected to constantly complete what are called e-learnings which most managers and higher ups expect you to do in your own personal time, and they never stop ever. You have to beg customers to give you a good word by filling out a survey and if you are recognized (which is very rare) then you do not recieve any kind of proper compensation such as raises or promotions. You pretty much recieve the equivalence of Chucky Cheese tickets which are called"
bad,"its a job friendly and nice"
bad,"Best Buy is a company that defends itself with stock numbers and performance numbers but fails to acknowledge the diminishing employee survey scores that litter the company.  For the most part, Best Buy seems to be a pretty competitive retail company.  It's the largest electronics retail store in America and provides competitive wages for uneducated high school and college students.  It's quite apparent, though, that unless you want to be a manager you will never make a good career out of working in Best Buy.  Supervisor pay isn't nearly enough considering the amount of time, energy, and stress that's involved.  It's a shame.  And let's not forget about the little thing in retail known as ""there's no such thing as holidays"".  As a line level employee, you are required to be in your store from October-December.  You cannot request any time off and the only days you will be guaranteed to have off are Thanksgiving Day (unless you work the new Black Friday hours which require you to go in on Thanksgiving night) and Christmas Day.  This may not be quite an issue for some, but as a line level employee and a supervisor living 3,000 miles away from my family I have seen how unfair it is for employees not to at least get a chance at seeing their families.  Sure, not everyone can be accommodated but at one store I worked at, a few of our part timers were college kids who would be going back home for the holiday breaks.  I'm supposed to rob them of seeing their family after being away for school just so corporate America can gain another dollar?  Another issue I had was with their religion"
bad,"Corporate management can not comprehend the issue of work/life balance. While it's understandable that the environment is incredibly competitive, it does come at a cost. Coupled with continued cost cutting measures and dwindling resources, I would not recommend this company as a place to begin or continue a career."
bad,Geek Squad is a short term job. You can only go so high up the ladder. I have been with BestBuy since i started college and transferred to Geek Squad toward the end of my degree completion. I am a Computer Science major and have been with the company for  four years. The company advertises that they look for a good mix of sales and tech skills but severely underpay tech who possess these skills.
bad,"not a career job but great for college students, great learning experience"
bad,"Best buy is an ok place to work, if you enjoy technology. Sales philosophy is constantly changing, and there is no real direction for the company nor advancement therein."
bad,"Typical work day consists of selling computers and tablets since I was in that area. I learned about every new product (computer wise) coming into the tech world thoroughly. Management was ok but they are always pushing for just sales and not really concerned about anything else. My coworkers were all young and vibrant, energetic and laid back. The hardest part of the the job was being able to keep track of all of the receipts for the products you sold. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to many different people face to face about technology."
bad,"New Hires: Best Buy is a difficult company to work for for many reasons. For newly hired employees, Best Buy does not offer sufficient training that allows the employee to be successful upon entering the sales floor. This creates a stressful environment for both new and existing employees. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"This place does not pay, no hours, and rude employees and ,managers"
bad,"You basically know what you're going to do each day, with a few surprises thrown in here and there."
bad,"Lots of work with little to no recognition."
bad,This was a ok business to work for. I left for reason that were out of my control.
bad,It worked for college. No desire to pursue professionally.
bad,Best Buy is a pretty busy place to work. Management always wants more than what can be provided. co-workers for the most part are cool. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever changing corporate plan. The job wasn't enjoyable.
bad,"Typically I'd come in and have to look at all the stress test reports on the computers we set up to run during the night, and determine what else needed to be done. Depending on what I was told to do I'd have to work either in the back working on computers or working out front with computers and customers. "
bad,"Assist customers with billing questions ,payments and purchase."
bad,"The company has issues with respecting employees personal time. Over promises and under delivers to their employees. "
bad,"Great place to start in as a teenager and not really expecting much out of it. Meeting people from all over the world was amazing. Being able to help them in anyway was great. Being able to help anyone was great. You get a lot of prasie when you find exactly what they needed. My co-workers are awesome. Teamwork was great. The hardest part of my job was holding your tounge when a customer disrespects you. And with that I learned to hold my tounge and even when you have a customer in your face screaming at you for something you have no control over. Management, well don't expect to be backed up when your in the right. "
bad,The management is telling you different things which makes it very difficult to perform job duties. The coworkers are great and have fantastic relationships. 
bad,"I worked at best buy for 4.5 years. I was young, naive and took semesters off from college in order to compensate their unwillingness to fix problems that so desperately needed fixing."
bad,Maintain and move heavy equipment
bad,The new ceo has a great process that will renew Best Buy. Management however does not possess the skills to lead a company. They are uneducated and have few people skills.
bad,"Valuable customer service experience, computer repair knowledge and training were exemplary."
bad,"Its a retail job, supervisors and managers need more training. The pressure of having to sell causes leadership to treat employees disrespectfully."
bad,Pay is ridiculous for the job that you do. Management hovers like hawks to criticize anything that you do however trivial and no counter productive to the job. Constantly expected to do more work than the pay you receive can justify. Boring and insipid work in a company desperate to remain relevant.
bad,"Small shop, little supervision or assistance when you need help, annoying customer who rightly complain over things you as a sales associate have no control over. Withstanding criticisms caused by the poor performance of others. Pay is paltry and not up to par with the job done. Mostly its a ghost town in there otherwise since this is a seasonal business."
bad,"Started off here while still in college and provided some support. I learned a lot of skills while on the job that proved to be useful. However, there came the time where the learning just stops. May have been the store, management, or the entire company, but there has been lack of coaching for employees."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I was a cashier for not even three months. The training was left up to employees who were there not much longer than I was due to the high turnover rate. I had to teach myself a great deal. I quickly found out that the company is all about the customers without even a hint of loyalty to its employees. It tries to compensate the poor work environment with a great discount which surprisingly fooled a lot of workers. However, as a woman working in a 1:6 female to male ratio, the misogyny and sexist remarks I faced by my coworkers on a daily basis couldn't be cancelled out by a good deal or two. Not to mention, managers almost completely disregarded peoples' availability so I was constantly working an entire eight hour shift during the peak holiday season by myself. Several times I requested to work nights but was always scheduled for mornings. Since my boyfriend works until midnight sometimes, this made it really difficult to maintain my life outside of work. Did I mention that people are almost never offered fifteen minute breaks, despite state law? On Black Friday I worked eleven hours on my feet. Overall, it was a complete waste of my time and easily takes the title of worst job I ever had."
bad,I love electronics an getting the chance to work there has been a great time. And of course cant deny the discount is amazing it sure does help around Christmas time.
bad,no. Not good. Pushy managers. Annoying Corporate Culture. Its best buy. They gonna ride you for every last cent
bad,"long hours standing behind a register, everything felt like clock work."
bad,"as a loss prevention specialist, my job was taken lightly by this employer and don't know how difficult this job can be during busy hours and holidays. Never offered a full-time position and only way to get a full-time position is favoritism."
bad,Overall Best Buy is a great starter job! It was a great experience and I learned a lot about different technology and services.
bad,There is a not a lot of room for growth within the company. Full time employees do not receive 36-40 hours a week due to what is be attributed to a bad economy.
bad,"they dont keep employees for a long time, they just want you when they need you, and when it goes slow they tell thank you and good bye"
bad,Competitive sales environment largely based on sales performance.
bad,"threats, intimidation, never know where you stand. management favoritism."
bad,"A good job to start off with, but the supervisors are terrible. They often do not explain what they want you to complete and do not stay consistent with their directions."
bad,I liked the job but the pay is not enough to live on. it is a social club for you to move up you need to know someone in management . the everyday work place is fun laid back
bad,"Typically managers were no where in sight despite frequent pages for their attention being needed by various employees through out the store. There is a bit of a frat house environment at times but focusing on the customers instead of the co-workers and the disorganized management can be very rewarding. Not to mention strong team dynamic unfortunately it did seem the goals were help customers, close sales, and avoid managers. Laziness was never punished but pointing out misconduct of managers often was the lead cause of termination for those who didn't quit."
bad,"You get paid little and work terrible hours. Typical retail. Some good managers, some terrible managers that can ruin moral for an entire store. Does not value education. A once excellent discount was taken away awhile back. Majority of employees are either in or straight out of high school so expect all the drama that high school brings. You'll meet some nice people and you'll meet some jerks. Essentially it's retail and it is what it is."
bad,"good job if you want to get on your feet, but nothing permanent."
bad,"Working at Best Buy typically consists of selling the latest technology to customers, while also keeping them informed on all the information they need to know to stay up to date on the brands they know and love. One great thing about working there is you learn everything you need to know, which not only helps in selling products to customers, but also helps you become more informed for your own personal purchases. Co-workers are either for you or against you which can be a headache. Instead of focusing on your skills, a lot of times things get too personal, which effects a person moving up in the company. Management seems to be okay with employees speaking bad on other co-workers to prevent them from getting ahead, and that's just sad. In all, Best Buy is nothing more than a corporate high school with mock elections and all."
bad,"The only thing fun about this place are the friendships you create excluding anyone in managment. The job is fun but is not challenging by any means, however you do get to meet interesting people everyday."
bad,I worked for this employer and I think it's nice for highs chool students/College students but as a adult they lied alot about pay etc.
bad,"The actual customer service aspect was fun and challenging, sadly the push to make customers sign up for a multitude of other services compounded with not being able to fulfill promises made for a stressful unfulfilled work environment."
bad,Best buy had great pay and benifits more no opportunity for advancment it went by senortiy and mangment was very ufair and had there favorites within the departments but learned alot of new skils.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I’m sure I would have rated this job better if I worked at a different location. The Best Buy location I worked at played favoritism and barely gave me any hours they gave all the hours to other new hires . I finally got fed up on Thanksgiving night when I saw the schedule I never went back after that day.
bad,"management just focus on the sell service plan, not customers."
bad,"Best Buy was a unenjoyable experience for me. The cons of working there highly outweigh the pros. Management is, for the most part, very uncooperative and will, most of the time, leave your questions unanswered, and will often just leave messages on read rather than responding. Although the staff is not on commission, many are still extremely competitive, and will insult you if you don't know certain things. Shifts are also very limited. Unless you are a full-timer, which there are only about four or five in the entire store, you are lucky to get two shifts a week. When I requested more shifts from the managers, I was always given the same response, which was that they were ""looking into it"". In the warehouse, which is where the product processing team works, the AC is completely broken, so it is always extremely hot or extremely cold. When brought up to management, they were extremely unprofessional, telling me to ""deal with it"", and that it ""wasn't a concern."" Favoritism is also very apparent amongst the management and staff. When awards and recognition are given, it is given to the same three or four people, making other staff members feel less important than the three or four favorites. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat/coldness, the pressure put on you by management, and dealing with aggressive co-workers. The most enjoyable for me was finding a very small group of people (three total) who weren't aggressive or rude, and whom I consider to be actual kind people. If you are looking to apply here, most likely for the discount, I urge you to reconsider,"
bad,"In the beginning, the company was great. Workers are friendly and actually worked. Not a lot of them were lazy. Company went through some changes and managements were under a lot of pressure which treated the coworkers horribly. There was a drama incident a couple of workers including an assistant management was fired."
bad,At the time I started they did not have any kind of set schedules for Us so we might open one day and close the next.  It was never the same two weeks in a row it was just to hard with the crazy schedule.
bad,"If you're looking for a stepping stone to get elsewhere in the workforce and don't plan on making a career out of sales, this place may be right for you. I was there over 2 years and the only way i was able to attain a DOLLAR pay increase hourly was to get promoted to a new position altogether. Doesn't matter how well you perform, do not expect to receive a decent raise for doing what's asked of you. Best Buy is one of the richest electronics chains in the world and they pay their hourly employees literal DUST."
bad,"It is VERY difficult to get full time work and the insurance is very expensive when you do.  As a parttimer, the hours are wildly unstable.  You'll have 10 hours in a month, followed by a couple weeks of working 45+ hours.  Advancement is very difficult and is based on tenure more than merit.  You aren't commission, but your sales numbers determine what shifts you get, how many hours, bonuses, etc.  You may as well be commission.  Even in Geek Squad, everything is based on how much you sell.  I get that it's retail, but they'd rather you compromise the quality of work in order to sell one more plan.  Our Geek Squad department had one female employee who had more experience, more availability, etc than her male counterparts, and she was still paid 50 cents an hour less.  She was pushed towards a more clerical role despite expressing interest in and aptitude at repair and expressed a disinterest in the more clerical role."
bad,The Break times are not right which makes it hard for some people ...  They do not hire anyone full time they keep the employee status is always called part time seasonal.
bad,"The job itself was fairly good, being that it wasn't difficult to pick up and provided decent experience. However, the job becomes exponentially more difficult when those above you try to accomplish something, only for the people, or person, above them to completely derail it. The general lack of respect, lack of consideration to genuine ideas and all around  ignorance of the higher management was  a constant factor throughout work days. While I did learn quite a few skills and techniques, to say I couldn't have learned them elsewhere, without all the constant negativity, would be false. Work days weren't overly difficult and neither were customer interactions. The atmosphere of the floor is very relaxed and honestly runs itself. The manager of my department actually understood how to effectively execute his position and provide motivation when needed, which helped tremendously. But don't be surprised if you find general managing somehow screwing things up."
bad,Best buy was a cool environment but it had its flaws.  For the amount of work we did i don't believe the pay was good. The management at that certain location didn't appreciate the employees.
bad,The entire interview and training process gave the impression that I was being hired for long term part-time. Turns out I was always Holiday help in managements view.
bad,"Management only cares about profit and not the workers they have, to them everyone is a dime a dozen to them. "
bad,I found the job itself is interesting however I found management to not be the most professional. They do promote people who do not deserve it. Overall it is okay.
bad,This company is the reason for me having to withdraw from 3 classes when i was in school. The management would not work with my scheduling in school. Bad company
bad,"The job was truly fun, learning all new things and plenty room for advancement in the beginning. I worked many jobs with in BEST BUY but Geek Squad was the most enjoyable for me."
bad,"Love sales , but this is one place that puts a lot of pressure on you , and management is not easy to approach when you have an issue they make things extremely uncomfortable."
bad,Way to much to add. Lets just say its a huge politics game and if you don't believe what management believes then you will get nowhere. Very unethical work practices when you reach supervisor and above with this company.
bad,I got hired on as seasonal. Went from 35 between Wednesday before Thanksgiving until through Sunday and haven't worked there since. I'm not scheduled for the rest of the month as well. Not very happy. I enjoyed working there just haven't received any hours.
bad,"Allowed room for learning how to deal with customers in a professional manner. Constant hiring, but management could have been stronger. Scheduling hours could have been better."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Working for Best Buy allowed me to gain knowledge in some technologies that were not taught in College, for example cell phones, GPS units and digital cameras."
bad,"The business model is constantly changing for Geek Squad City in Brooks, KY. This can be good for learning a variety of jobs but it also has caused cuts in hours & layoffs. "
bad,I worked in both the store and for corporate best buy(project team). I actually enjoyed my managers and most coworkers at the store but project team had a lot of idiots. Most managers feel entitled and overpowered. Salary is okay but raises are a joke. Scheduling depends on your boss. No healthcare.
bad,"Best Buy was a typical retail environment and Retail is definitely not for me. "
bad,"As a young adult, this place was not so bad because of the work schedule. Benefits/pay were subpar but the discount was nice. But as time passed, no real advancements or opportunities arose."
bad,Best buy was a decent place to work at sometimes . Scheduling was all over the place though and I was not a fan of that. The workplace was a very lively place when I did get scheduled. The hardest part of the job was having to do virtual learnings way more than hands on experience.
bad,"My job at Best Buy was very simple but they constantly put extra stuff on me and I was not paid accordingly. There was no room to grow, and little opportunity I had they turned it down."
bad,Lower management doesnt have a clue how to treat employees or how to manage people as they treat their workers like cattle with no respect for feelings
bad,"Decent pay for retail, however still not enough for California. Best Buy is none commission how ever you are expected to hit targets almost like if you were but are not... you really have to be able to juggle a fast passed environment and have lots of patience. Sometimes dealing with customers and management is like dealing with kids so lots of patience."
bad,"some stores are run better than others, corporate didn't make the best decisions when it came to policies or job positions.  You are told you don't work on commission, but they base their reviews on your sales alone.  It's a good place if you are trying to work around school hours, but there is almost no chance at getting a full-time position."
bad,"I worked in the computer sales department for the holidays of 2017. I learned a little about computers but the other employees were always too busy or didn't care about helping the new guys. Management was okay, the manager was hardly ever there and the assistant manager was there all of the time. The assistant manager tried to motivate the associates by trying new things and incentives but he would give you the cold shoulder and let you know how disappointed he was when you had to call in sick. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure the customer got their laptop as fast as possible and only one or two people had the key to unlock the cabinet. Also not knowing where anything was and getting very little help or understanding."
bad,Help assist clients who had technology related questions.  Learned how to properly provide customer solutions in multiple circumstances.  Management favored the ones who would listen to them even if it meant doing improper practices. Employees were a main reason to stay for so long with the company.  Hardest part of job was selling impractical solutions to clients who did not need it but the company desired the money.  Most enjoyable was the feeling of honesty when helping assist a client.
bad,"Working at Best Buy IS a Good LEARNING Experience, but not a great job for advancement, pay & input."
bad,you work 5 days a week starting from 12 or 1pm all the way until you finish unloading the truck and putting stock away along with assisting customers which usually means you are working till 2am or later with one 45min lunch break
bad,"Geek squad employment heavily relies on sales."
bad,Good job for someone who loves to work with people and needs a flexible schedule. Expect to be resourceful when helping customers because the provided trainings are not enough to help answer customer inquiries.
bad,Geeksquad was a lot of fun you stay up to date on the latest gadgets and stuff but it's still retail so you have to sell sell sell don't think of making this a career job.
bad,"Typical day: Started with morning meeting where goals were outlined. Specific departments were told of their expectations for the day."
bad,It's not a good place to work as it pertains to employee/manager relationship. The atmosphere is a joke. Not too many smart or intelligent people work there.
bad,"I was always bouncing around between two different departments my entire time there, constantly doing either new or just retreading old e-learning on the computer, very little actual training was done."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"The upper management was great, but the lower management was flaky and unreliable, enjoyed work, but was not secure while at my job, didn't feel there were ways to advance.  When let go reason was not provided, I was just no longer being scheduled."
bad,"Encourages you to rip off every customer, and not really solve their issues. People are rewarded for how many ""service plans"" they sell, not for genuine helping or knowledge. Don't think outside the box, just sell those plans."
bad,"While Best buy was great in terms of learning about product specs and smart purchasing, it was not at all flexible for part time work. Due to the hands off management I experienced at my site, work schedules were rarely fair in a college environment as getting time off would ultimately mean that someone else who also has college work would have to cover which led to a more cut throat mind set when negotiating with coworkers."
bad,"Always a busy department. Unloading trucks and re-stocking twice a week. Always changing prices. Resetting sections all the time. Sometimes deals could be had with buying equipment direct from vendors."
bad,"Not an entirely bad place to work, but the pay is nothing compared to the work. Often responsibilities are added and knowledge is required of many positions, but doing well at your job doesn't mean anything for your compensation."
bad,"Most of the job was self-taught. Computer quizzes. Management was poor, the exception of a manager who wasn't the store manage. He seemed to do everyones job for them. Workplace was fine generally. Commission failed to fall through, since due poor budget planning from Managers. Some of the coworkers were really nice."
bad,My time at Best Buy was not the greatest to say the least. It might not have been the company itself but the people in the store. I knew it wasn't me because I have ben all over the world and meet many people working with the Army. I am usually a very likable person as well as a hard worker. I think if Best Buy Replaces the leadership it will make a better working environment.
bad,I liked working there ... Untill. 
bad,I've been working there for 6 years and they still won't put me in a supervisors position but they will give it to the newer staff. There's game night once a month
bad,"This job was great as a first job. To get you feet wet and learn to be responsible. But there are too many politicians and not enough leadership. It is very clear that the employee is just a number, but if you recognize the benefits and learn all you can, you can feel a peace with the fact that you will find something better."
bad,Best Buy it's toxic and I would never recommend working in an environment that will make you hate waking up every morning knowing you're going to have a bad day.
bad,"you start at 4 am loading your truck with 22 stops and sometimes more. Leaving from Tracy to Santa Rosa if you're lucky with all this traffic. By the time you arrive its roughly 930 by your first stop. With all those stops with your truck, it is impossible to finish in 8 hours. That's why we're working sometimes more than 12 hours a day and they do not pay over time."
bad,Its fun when you start working there but good luck when you try to move up there is alot of favoritism there so unless you know management your chances are slim to none
bad,Very busy workplace with not so good management. Pay was horrible but benefits were ok. Would not recommend working there. Company knows about the problems but are not willing to do anything about them.
bad,"If you plan to work at Best Buy, it is wise that you come in with a mindset that it is a numbers game. Meeting company and individual budget, obtaining user feedback, and meeting company goals are some of the things that you are expected to obtain while working for less."
bad,"Co-workers are fun to be around and always seem to hangout, but management likes to flirt with co-workers and take them out. Management is too busy worrying about who they can hangout with after work and talking about personal issues out in the open rather than focus on customer service."
bad,Essentially the job positions shrink and those responsibilities are put on the remaining employees. It feels like the company is going down the same path as Circuit City.
bad,You can't sale with your gut. You have to follow their process. Even if you have business degree. You have been taught how to gauge customers as they come into the store. You can't just give the customer space. You are made to immediately sale a customer and get all of their information.
bad,"J'ai aimé travailler avec l'équipe, mais la mentalité de l'entreprise de vendre des services."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I only loved working at Best Buy because they were flexible with my schedule and I loved my coworkers. Management always plays favorites and compensation was poor.
bad,A typical day at best buy was slow. I learned a lot about electronics. the management was ok. The hardest part about the job the pay. The most enjoyable about best buy was the customers.
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal worker and kept on as a permanent part time. The pay is low and the company is unwilling to hire employees full time. My department only ever had 3 (out of 15 to 20 employees in that department for that store) that were full time: the department manager, the department assistant manager and the supervisor. "
bad,it began as an awesome job in the beginning i only had to do what my job title was towards the last year of employment there i was having to take on 2 supervisors positions which was near impossible since both needed attention constantly and when one got attention another department was lacking the attention needed
bad,"i didnt get many hours and the pay was not well. the hours were not there and no overtime. with that salary i could not be able to support my family. there was a small staff for the whole store and back in the warehouse area, where there should be more than one person doing work, i would be the only one scheduled till the store closing. very under staffed"
bad,Computer salesmen are not paid by commission but management is very insistent on focusing on sales. Training is suspiciously negative of work unions .
bad,"For a kid in high school its an ok job, but they have no respect working with your school schedule. very low paid for the amount of work they expect out of you."
bad,I have no words to express how i feel about best buy. I tried about 4 years to get in with best buy and when i did i was promised A FULL TIME POSITION  and instead i got the boot.
bad,"it was fine till a new gm stepped in broke a working forumla,changing schedules that didnt work for ppl when they didnt need to be changed..............."
bad,"The pay is not fair for the work you do there, and the management does not make it beneficial to be someone that works hard there.  This place holds true to the saying ""10% of the people do 90% of the work."" Unless you steal, or physically harm someone, you will not get fired."
bad,"Based off the experience at my store alone. Might be better at other stores. "
bad,"This job is great if you are looking to add sales experience in your resume. The pay is ok since its above minimum wage. The sales goals however are a major sore since its very tedious to keep up with it. If you have a life, may as well kiss it goodbye if you plan to work here."
bad,"Malgré le nombre de client, notre équipe s'assuraient toujours de garder sur le plancher une ambiance acceptable"
bad,Longterm employees stick together and hardly any advancement for newer employees.  Business runs as if they make compensation for sales even when customers really can't afford stuff.
bad,Just like any workplace once you have been their for so long you will eventually have to find something new. Nothing bad about the company its just retail i am anting to have a better work life balance is the only reason I am leaving.
bad,"Fun and fulfilling. Great for college students. Awesome management."
bad,"You are paid by the hour. No comission, no bonuses.  You have very hard sales quotas to meet, most of which result in bonuses for management team. You have a 1 on 1 weekly meeting to discuss your performance which is fine, but it's mainly about getting certain sales quotas so management gets their bonuses.  A typical day results in walking around talking to customers trying to get sales. The walkie talkies that you see Best Buy employees with in their ear, MAINLY is used for staff to ask for keys or assitance. However what also goes on is management announces half hour and hourly updates in your ear about sales, warranties and in home services and budgets that they are pushing on you about. They will push and push until they reach their quota. They will call out who just sold what to make certain people look good, can be very disheartening for sure. You do NOT have scheduled lunch breaks on an 8 hour shift, you must ask for permission to eat lunch. Sometimes you have to wait 5, 6 or more hours before being allowed to go for lunch. The best part is helping customers who really need it as that is rewarding. The worst part is the weekly meetings where management bugs you to keep getting higher and higher numbers so they get higher bonuses. Also everyone can track everyone else's numbers so there is NO CONFIDENTIALITY. If you are struggling everyone else can see it by logging in and seeing all of your differnet sales metrics.  Very poor."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"served customers"
bad,"Nice culture, good training and support. Great for young people especially those interested in tech. Great company to springboard into other companies or strive for a limited GM position."
bad,"Things were okay, You will not much support from whatever team you get put on, as the pressure to get paid more than the next person ensures a dog-eat-dog environment where instead of helping others your team sabotages you from within."
bad,This place is good but not for a career management sometimes are really hard and demand alot of you no matter if your full time or part time if you have family it's really not a good place to work
bad,"I feel that after investing critical time and a hard working ethic, BestBuy takes advantage of many of their employees in regards to advancement opportunities. If there are any advancements, many of their veteran employees are sought first, regardless of merit and performance. Everything moves slowly internally and the management chain of command isn't as efficient as it has the potential to be. Taking the job seriously and investing yourself in it will just lead to false hopes of promotions and will just burn you out. One major aspect that potential employees should take into consideration is that the job should be short term at most (under 1 Year) because they will hire you part time, give you a proximity of full time hours (without the raise and benefits) and delay advancements to full time since its more efficient to keep you at bay as part time. Becoming full time is considered a promotion and can take from 1-1.5 years- where again the veterans are considered first."
bad,"Employees are basically told whatever just to make you happy.  You will be under paid, most of the time they will hire teenagers for cheep labour.  It was a good experience but no way a life career..."
bad,"Its retail. Its what you think retail is like, just a bit worse. Customers get angry with you for promises the sales floor makes. Managers get angry with you for no meeting sales goals or having to get them involved because customers demand something we can't give them. Shifts range between 4 hours and 10 hours, yet I still have to work 6 days a week to make 32 hours for full time. Don't even think of asking off during the holidays or you're vulnerable for being let go. Managers have their favorites that can just sit around and talk all day. "
bad,This was work from home using my personal computer. It was based on seasonal needs. Being a coach/supervisor I was considered a permanent employee. Training for the season employees was very poor. We had to work hard on the chat page to instruct new agents on following procedures. I worked there 4 years and never got a raise. The reason for staying was because I had to be home because I was having to raise my granddaughter. I had multiple notes at my right hand so I was able to give agents quick and accurate answers. The QA were also were not formatted for the job being performed.
bad,As long as you hit your goals no one really cares. I f you cant management will be in your face. Some managers are bad at training people. Co-workers are awesome.
bad,"Title says it all. You are expendable and management does not care about you. The ""values"" are simply lip service. If you go to management with a legitimate issue, they twist your words and somehow the issue ends up being framed as only your own. Perfect example of gas lighting. Management knows that you won't get paid as well for an entry level job anywhere else. That's how they trap you. No set schedule so youre eassentially a part-timer who works 37.5 hours per week. Your opinion is not valued and those who speak up end up being shot down or reprimanded. Absolutely no support from management and advancement is extremely difficult unless you ""get in"" with a manager and live the CULTure. The only way you can survive for life is to value the business more than the employees. "
bad,"hate it. managers call me in being all nice in their texts, but once im at work they get easily upset at me for slightly messing up. im working on my only day off, super exhausted and having dreams of myself at work all stressed, and im being punished. not good"
bad,"While there is room for advancement there is also room for regression. I worked for this company for a long time and saw new leadership instated almost yearly. Although sales were not based on commission you still have a culture like that of a car dealership. If you enjoy selling this may be a good place to start, but once you've learned what you can, GET OUT!!"
bad,"Off the three managers at my specific store two of them were extremely unreasonable about daily tasks. The schedule wouldn't be posted for the next week until Friday night which made it extremely difficult to make social plans. Not at all accommodating for part-time workers who go to college, whereas I would often be scheduled outside my availability."
bad,"We worked at a stand-alone service facility, and 20 years of repair experience was typical of the employees then. I worked there at a time when things were repaired, rather than replaced, and we'd actually call customers to keep them informed throughout the repair process, as well as to help them to localize a problem, should we find no problem with the unit before us on the bench. "
bad,"It has been a while since i worked here but when i did work there the work environment has been stressful and management has shown lots of favoritism, and different standards and rules for the different employees. The customers that come in are typically very friendly and wonderful to work with, and the tasks that are required to be accomplished throughout the day aren't that hard."
bad,"Good place to work seasonally or for those out of high school.  Management is lacking and there is no accountability. People call off constantly but are not reprimanded.  So, those who do show up have to work harder to accommodate for the short number of staff."
bad,"Typical day at best buy would be dealing with customers of course as well as dealing with managers that gain some sort of authority and feel the need to speak to you as if you're a child. It is a challenge working with new managers, it is a challenge keeping your cool while you work with your new managers also."
bad,You cant move in this place because its a dead concept the people are usually nice but it will break your spirit. Time will tell if it wasn't for cell phones they would be with circuit city
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"While working as a Consultation Agent for Best Buy's Geek Squad, I further developed my interpersonal skills and sales skills more than I did my technical aptitude. The job title says it all, you spend the majority of your time dealing with unruly customers that vent their frustrations with their lack of understanding technology on you. The job description includes things like repairs on pc's but mostly all you do is functionality checks on devices in order to get them back out on to the sales floor. While the pay is decent for the level of skill required, the hours are not friendly to home life what-so-ever. Management is hit or miss - either you have a supervisor that cares sincerely about their job and their employee's/customers or you have a supervisor that cares more about hitting bonus.Job advancement is abysmal, out of the 10 agents that work the precinct, only one is full time. Your hours are reliant solely on productivity of the precinct so the less customers you have, the less hours you work. This creates for very little advancement within the company. Benefits are very minimal if you work part time."
bad,Best Buy is in a fight to stay relevant in the big box arena. With the growth of the on line business the company is forced to put the pressure on the store teams to drive the business and forget the human side of the equation
bad,"Management is extremely demanding for what you get paid, awful customers, a commission-based environment without the actual commission, stupid rules and poorly run systems that make it very difficult to actually do your job."
bad,"Good for a first job, favoritism rules here. can't do anything about that. Management benefits from everything that sales."
bad,"overall good place to work, really nice people, helpful and taught me a lot but little to no hours. working with Best Buy was a good experience."
bad,"not the greatest place, but not the worst. Seemed extremely political, with 90% of management promotions came from being in the right click rather than merit based."
bad,"Best Buy has great employee discounts, but the workplace is very stressful. Management puts a lot of pressure on employees to to persuade customers to spend as much money as possible. To put it in simple terms, Best Buy doesn't pay us commission but expects us to act like we are."
bad,"Over worked for little pay. Fine as a part time job but the stores do not incentivize any of their employees.Working around the holidays the only real bonus you ever receive is the over time hours, rest of the calendar year you get what you get."
bad,"Not much to say. Only worked for 3 months for temp work, though i wish i'd been hired on. Its a great job for anyone getting started in the Tech industry/Customer service."
bad,"Best buy is not the worst company to work for but it is also not the best. After a bittersweet time with the company, I plan to apply the lessons learned to a brighter career future."
bad,"No comment for this company, was not a good experience for me. And there was too much to work with there meaning co-workers never fulfilled there jobs and managers never said anything about anything. horrible place to work."
bad,Your day depends on your job description. Extremely high-turnover as managers are always leaving or being fired. The job is sales driven so how well you sell will determine how you are treated. You will learn how to sell products and improve your customer service skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with their problems.
bad,"When I started at BestBuy, a new GM had been hired. We were given training modules for the first 2 weeks for product knowledge. Our on floor training was poor and we mostly had to learn how to manage doing the job ourselves. Since the entire store was being overhauled, a lot of our floor training changed within a month of working there. This meant that we had to adjust rapidly to changes, creating chaos on the floor for employees and customers alike. Some of these changes included policies, items and SOP"
bad,Unload trucks. separate merchandise. must know computer components. Management does not address employee confrontations.
bad,"Friendly environment, scheduling and management could use work.  It was easy to get along with everyone, very team oriented. Monthly achievements are just pats on the back with no real substance."
bad,"la facilidad con el horario ayuda mucho aprendes a convivir con personas que necesitan de tu ayuda a si como tu de la suya,la gerencia es rígida en ocaciones y la supervision mala es mala en la actualidad  pues me agrada el trabajo es facil sencillo y siempre hay algo que hacer"
bad,"Great customers, good atmosphere from employees but a lot of favoritism needed to get promoted.Overall a fun place, customers know what they want for most part and interesting learning about customer's lifestyle and needs."
bad,"The company was highly understaffed and they required us to work all departments, a lot of the time the store felt empty."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,good plave to work but the pay is not really worth deal with tons of different rude and nice people but your pay is really low so it makes the job not really worth it
bad,"Worked in customer service for three years, great personal reviews but if you didn't know people in the right places you won't advance specially if you're of a certain age.  Work environment is okay specially for millenials."
bad,Best buy isnt a terrible place to work but with how your numbers a tracked and the numbers you have to maintain it seems a little extreme for only 10 per hour. The hardest part about best buy was the turnover in management in two years I had a total of  15 different bosses.
bad,"I worked as an assistant store manager with Best Buy.  While my career got off to a great start, things started to take a turn for the worst after about 5 years.  The staff cuts and store leadership reorganization made it very difficult to get the job done in the already strenuous 50 hour work week.  I found myself working extra and taking my work home.  I found myself needing to be available at all times, the stress level was very high and expectations ridiculous.  Despite the fact that the money was nice, I eventually left to start over with a new company at a much less pay rate and I am proud to say this is the best decision I have ever made for myself.  Be warned, money is not everything!"
bad,"Unlike many large companies, the management does not have a very good structure. The constant switch of power leads to a lot of confusion. Lack of productivity is major. Constant misunderstandings."
bad,"The store in Shadowlake is where I worked and that store has major organization problems and management problems. Management is completely out of touch with the workers and know little about anyone's job and only judges you by your numbers. Getting the tools you need to succeed is like pulling teeth as management will refuse to order anything and when they do, corporate will take several weeks to give you something you have been out of for a month. They push veterans to the limit until they leave so they can hire people for less money, while I may be wrong about this I noticed this pattern."
bad,"well, if you are currently no job, it is ok place to stay"
bad,"Geek Squad CA position is more of a sales team Rep. than a computer repairman "
bad,A typical day would be me filing papers. I would also register students for classes as well as except payments!! My co workers seemed very friendly toward me. The hardest part was keeping the students smiling. Enjoyable part is making them happy!!
bad,I worked here seasonally in the Mall of America. If you would like to see the first phases of the zombie apocalypse I recommend trying to get a job here during Christmas time. It is for this reason I will never work in an electronics store ever again.
bad,"Poor management, unprofessional staff, poor customer service,"
bad,I only have one story to say about Best Buy. I was told through another employee that I was fired many many times. After talking to my manager though this seemed to be false. I ended up leaving the company due to how I was treated by this other employee.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working there, poor management and underwhelming pay. It's just a typical retail job, no different from any other retail job."
bad,"Best Buy could be fun and enjoyable, but it doesn't pay you enough to do what they ask...they have sales goals to hit, and you only get bonus if everyone else hits their goals...co workers are usually awesome, and the discount ROCKS. but I don't think that I'll be seeking employment there again anytime soon."
bad,"I originally applied for Geek Squad to start to build my professional experience with computers while obtaining an hourly wage. It was not exactly what I was looking for when comparing to my current major in school, but it was technical experience nonetheless. "
bad,"-you don't get compensated for your job"
bad,This Company is desperate to keep it's doors open and are cutting jobs with little to no chance of advancement.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I enjoyed my job because of my co-workers and customers. The greatest part of each day was always having customers come to you thanking you for the simplest things. Whether it was teaching them how to use their phone or access the internet, the littlie improvements you can make to someone's life can have a huge impact. BestBuy is a place where a lot can go wrong and no one speaks the truth. I have learned no matter who or what wrong is wrong and no one should be held to a higher standard."
bad,I loved working for Best Buy initially until management was changed around several times. There was never any follow through with developing employees on the part of management. They would drag their feet to give anyone a raise and when they did so it was very minimal. Several of the long time employees including myself left due to the reasons I have listed.
bad,You seem to be only as good or valued as the last p+l.  People are sacrificed in face of challenging sales. Customer service is dropped in face of preserving a sales metric.
bad,Management is a joke.  They are all self interested and do not care about their employees.  There was a girl that was hypoglycemic and she needed to eat every 2 hours.  They told her and wrote her up for abandoning her job and eating when she was not on break or lunch.  That is just a small example.
bad,"I learned from working here that you don't sell a customer a product you sell them an experience. However, toward the end of my time there, the company changed for the worse, asset protection is now almost non-existent and sales staff do pretty much everything in the store, we'd sell product, clean, train new staff, stock inventory, we performed ap's entire job practically and I felt that corporate level management no longer cared about employees and felt my job was no longer stable."
bad,"I spent over ten years in the employ of Best Buy.  I held a plethora of positions throughout the store, including supervisory ones.  The vast majority of managers that cycled through like a revolving door were uneducated and inexperienced.  Best Buy customers seem to also be the worst kind - a ridiculous sense of entitlement.  I learned a good deal from my time there from the rare high quality manager, but overall I feel like I wasted a decade of my life.  Upon my decision to resign, nobody in store management or from the district offices reached out and attempted to retain me as an employee (after 10+ years of service).  "
bad,"Informing customers on products that are out and new ones coming out. There was no real room to grow and no job satisfaction, my co-workers and management really good people so that was a plus."
bad,"This is a good place to work as long as you do what you're supposed to do. The co-workers are great and the job isn't that hard if they schedule enough people, now the management is questionable but besides the lack of decent managers it's an ok place."
bad,"Micro Management,  Favortism with management.  Closing duties. Stayed way passed your schedule time on many nights.  Most co-workers were friendly."
bad,"In this job I started with a great GM, Such a great man and then he moved and we had a new GM. He was a terrible guy. Not nice to his employees, was blaming things on employees that was not their fault. This was what I got caught up in. Several things happened that was not my fault or my helpers fault but we still got the blame. A good example would be that he had a flat tire in the middle of no where. We had no idea where we were so we had to call a wrecker and the sheriffs dept. to find us. Apparently it was our fault because the tire went flat."
bad,Dealing with customer issues. Handling personal information for the customer and processing paperwork and certain functions in the system.
bad,"NCO/Best Buy was a call center with the main purpose of customer service.  Employees aren't allowed to use the restroom on the clock, and the benefits offered were very expensive.  The hardest part of the job was listening to many clients who were upset and just wanted to yell at you expecting an answer."
bad,"I had applied to best buy for a cashier position. I had the first and second interviews and then at the end of the second interview the general manager called me back in to tell me they did not have a cashier position open but they did have a customer service position. I was told repeatedly by the manager that it was simply returns and exchanges. However, I was wrong. I was thrown into the Geek Squad Customer Service Agent position which I knew nothing about. I was expected to have background knowledge on troubleshooting and computer repair. With no background in computer technology I  never had the answers for a customer who was inquiring information on their computer, tv, appliance ect. I had to work long hours sometimes without a break. It was always short staffed therefore the customers were always waiting in line for excessive amounts of time. Customers who wanted to do a simple return would have to wait in like for much longer because one agent would be dealing with a cracked iPad screen while the other was activating a phone. I was also written up for something that happened during one of my TRAINING shifts when it was so busy that I had to do returns by myself and was not given proper instruction on how to complete the transaction. "
bad,Best Buy is Fast paced environment. Most of my days consist of helping customers find product and sales.Working for Best Buy I learned to group sale products.My co workers are a joy to work with they help the day go by.The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers especially the one's who get violent. The Most enjoyable part of my day is when I see my regular customer I find it interesting to listen to the new stories they have to tell me about products they have purchased.
bad,"to keep the short and simple I love best buy as a company but the choice in management, the only thing I miss honestly is my co-workers and the discount"
bad,"i spent most of my day doing work in many departments and aiding customers. for a Hybrid big box, it was operated more like a small store where everyone was doing duties outside their department."
bad, Over time Best Buy strayed away from taking care of customers. It made for a harsh environment to work in.
bad,"If you enjoy a relaxed and relatively care-free environment to work in, Best Buy is great.  I now have a child and realize that I am looking for a more professional work environment.  The schedule is extremely volatile and you have to check your schedule online every day so you don't miss changes that can be made without your knowledge.  Being retail, it can be very demanding on your patience dealing with the general public on a daily basis.  Even with the increase in pay over the standard sales floor associate, the downsides are vast."
bad,Did not agree with some of the values held by management. A lot of promises made to employees that aren't rightly fulfilled.
bad,"A typical day at the Best Buy would me coming in around 1:00 and finishing the moring peoples work. After I do this, I start on my closing duties which include, PRC, carry outs, creating tags for open items, and if it's Monday or Thursday, I unload and finish the truck. After I do all this I have to hear my supervisor or manager yell at me for my co-workers mistakes. I wouldn't mind this if I worked full time but was considered part time and my full timer rarely works but gets full time benifits."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,pay rate was great with annual pay raises. work was easy but management was not very helpful or knowledgeable and most had no previous warehouse expierence at all
bad,I would go to work and I would get to work with customers all day. Getting to know their needs and what they needed was a ton of fun. I got the opportunity to match the customer to the perfect solution for them. If I had any issues management was typically slow to respond and was hardly ever clear with resolutions. I was hired as a temp but I wish I could have stayed.
bad,Fun place to work lots going on.Video games and very clean store.
bad,"Accepted, cash check and credit cards in payment for items purchased in a retail store."
bad,"High volume store, fast paced environment on a daily basis. I enjoy helping customers and team developement."
bad,pays low but that' more lilkely because soon they will go out of business
bad,"As Best Buy continues to struggle in the marketplace, it has begun to put more and more demands on its employees. Best Buy's inability to be nimble and react with market changes ultimately has put it in a tough position. The hardest part of this job was working for a General Manager who knew about harassment going on and did nothing to attempt to resolve the issue."
bad,Work day is customer service and coaching. Make sure schedules are done in advance. Merchandise your area. Co-workers are cool but not upper management.
bad,Interesting place to work to say the least. Co workers are fun but the lack of managers caring about the employees and lack of coverage in the store makes it very hard to stand working there
bad,Poor management but very fun work environment. Very poor compensation and benefits.
bad,"The company was more about the 'numbers' rather than the publicly claimed needs of the customer. If you weren't selling the most expensive items to everyone all the time, you were apparently being frowned upon."
bad,"Desperate company losing market share, unable to stay relevant in modern world. Destroyed employee discount. Paying wages lower than competition. Doing mass layoffs. No job security. Will hire new people for dirt cheap and look for a reason to eliminate employee within 1 year of hire. Turnover rate is over 85%."
bad,Loved working for the company but the focus is always from an angle that is difficult to explain to line level employees. The company can teach you a lot about business and salesmanship it can be great for a college student or part time job for the discount.
bad,"Would sell electronic products throughout the store, farm."
bad,"I thought working at a Fortune 100 company would be like working in a dream. Instead, it was like working for a slow, decrepit man who never really wanted to change, but kept saying he knew he needed to. To get anything changed, it had to go through several layers of leadership, and even getting to that point was difficult, as managers in my department are not supportive of ideas or movement within the organization."
bad,"Management was great at first. Didn't hire people for months when we needed it. They knew I was leaving and didn't hire anyone. I know its a bad economy, but you've gotta have people in the store to help customers. It was too hectic for $9/hr base pay. Management joked around too much. They also asked me to stay employed there after my last day because they messed up and didn't hire anyone. I said no because at the time I was working two jobs and in school. They didn't care about that, though."
bad,"While there are some good details about working at Best Buy, there are a lot of details that need to be worked out if they want to be taken seriously as a company."
bad,"Rang up customers, whilke keeping a positive attitude and smile on my face."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I worked in the Cell/ MP3 department. Activated cell phones and sold accessories for cell phones and MP3 devices.
bad,"I love working for best buy because it has great benefits, the people are nice and we all feel like family"
bad,"Working at Best Buy, in the Best Buy for Business Division, was pretty enjoyable for the first year. Compensation was decent, insurance benefits were good, and the chance for growth in the company seemed achievable. Everything changed the second year. The sales goal ramp that our team was placed on was very difficult, and only got harder each quarter. It became almost impossible to get a bonus. My supervisor began trying to push me to take a cut in pay so that I could be placed in a lower sales ramp bracket (to make it easier to achieve my required monthly sales numbers). I also had a top-level supervisor hint that he wanted me to ""LIE"" to a customer. Everyone on our sales team, that I started with at Best Buy, has now been either fired or laid off. Turn over and pressure at this company is VERY high. The culture is aggressive, divisive, and greedy. Stay away."
bad,"This place does not cater to those who do not have a degree. If you are not in school working part time at BBY, don't even consider the job. They don't cater the non-management, non-degreed jobs to those who need to be gainfully employed."
bad,"Cuando llegaron los sudacas a hacerse cargo de la empresa, todo se desvarió. Hoy nadie saluda ni atiende en las tiendas. La empresa está manejada por puro payaso...."
bad,while the location i worked at may not have been positive on my outlook on the company im sure theres a location that will help develop their talent the proper ways
bad,"Ive been around long enough to see several locations and work at corporate. Some managers care about you and help, others get HR complaints against them and do not care as the company does nothing about it. The HR at best buy are next to none, when looking at your jobs pay scale, you will never be out of the lower band, and its not about what you know, but who you know to move up in the company. Go out drinking with the team instead of going to school and getting a degree is the best way to move up."
bad,"Started as seasonal part time, worked my way up to full-time about 6 months later. "
bad,"Best Buy was once a place that felt like home. You had all the latest and greatest gadgets, entertainment and appliances. Work wasn’t stressful and you got to meet a lot of great people employees and customers. Under new management that’s when everything went down hill for Best Buy. Now there were goals that had to be met within your hours and you didn’t get enough hours. You got less hours when you didn’t meet goal. It wasn’t fun anymore. Best Buy doesn’t care about it’s employee’s."
bad,Fun place to work for younger people. The pay rate is too low. Fast paced atmosphere. Well managed for the most part with a few exceptions. A good place to work for a student looking for part time.
bad,I don't have anything to truly leave for best buy. I started working for the company about 2 years ago and so much has changed. I only worked their to meet my financial needs.
bad,"Work life balance is not great, open late every day have to put in time off request well in advance and even then not positive that it will get approved."
bad,"This job kept changing my hours, they were never enough. no chance to become a full-time employee. Holidays were crazy and no sick days. The only raise I ever got was 15 cents. No set schedule, and I was always being pulled into filling in for someone in a different department."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, combined with poor leadership and low wages (with no commission either) creates a very negative work environment. Impossible to feel good about customer interactions because of the high expectations to push so many unnecessary products and services on them (Total Tech Support, Geek Squad Protection, Best Buy Cards, extra accessories...)."
bad,Best Buy doesn't really care about it customers or it's employees they just want to lie to you sell you junk and promise you things they cannot deliver on.
bad,If you need a job Best Buy is something to keep you going why you keep looking for a good job I would not plan on having a career at Best Buy.  During my time at Best Buy I was reprimanded for selling “too many”  of the  tVs on sale.
bad,"Throughout both of my periods of employment at best buy, I have seen multiple GMs. Only one is worth working for. The rest have no business running a store."
bad,Starting pay is nothing great. The entire store might as well be run by part-time workers. The only way to get a slightly pleasing pay increase is to apply for another full-time position in another store. Culture dies out real quick with the lacking in the actual enjoyment of working for Best Buy.
bad,Working at geeksqud I was always a lone wolf always understaffed and never got a pay raise in 3 years. The work that was done was never appreciated at all
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"NOT A JOB FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY. If you have an anxiety disorder this is not the job for you. In sales its very stressful, you are not working on commission but management makes you push sales as if you are. If you work an 8 hour shift you will lose your mind. Each customer interaction is roughly 10 mins so you will feel the stress of mangers jumping down your throat between each customer as to why you're not doing anything. You will get burnt out pretty quickly. Advancements for higher positions only happen if you are favorited. If you aren't liked then plans on how to boot you will be conspired. Its not what is use to be working for Best Buy use to be a lot funner. You have to negotiate pay if you are getting hired, a lot of entry level jobs that don't require customer interaction are paying around 18-20/HR so keep that in mind. Working Thanksgiving is required."
bad,"A typical day consisted of checking your goals when you came in, team huddle, then off to your section. I had one manager that cared to grow her associates."
bad,"This company pays minimum wage, little growth in pay."
bad,Tienen mucha preferencia de empleados a unos les hacen más caso que a otros y no te dan soluciones cuando hay conflictos laborales y sobrecargan mucho el trabajo más a unos que a otros
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy overall. Great coworkers, you learn a lot, there’s some really knowledgeable staff all over the place if you want to learn something new."
bad,"Best Buy sounds like a fantastic job from the outside but once you are on the inside, you quickly realize it is all ""smoke and mirrors."" Corporate and management seem to think that you should be able to hit their unrealistic numbers NO MATTER WHAT. Did you get forced into another department you know nothing about for a month or two? Doesn't matter...be prepared to be put on an ""Action Plan"" if you fall behind even a fraction for a few months (not in a row either)."
bad,"You do not make comission but they want you to sell like you do. They want you to almost scam people into getting a credit card."
bad,"Best buy is  an okay place to work for if you're looking for just a paycheck. The majority of supervisors are petty and immature. They don't really care about their employees they're just interested in job preservation. I've heard managers make fun of other employees when they're standing 20 feet away from the individual that making fun of. if you have any ambition and are looking to improve yourself and advance your career, don't work at Best Buy."
bad,"Expected to act like a professional commissioned salesperson but paid 12$ an hour. Despite being one of the top salesmen in my department, was not able to get a full time position even after reaching my one year mark with the company."
bad,"Was a great place to work, They tend to have crooked  Management.   And of course they don't know how to do there job properly.  Loved my job Until Managment changed over and sad that I new how to do my job better than Manager and he didn't like that."
bad,"This is a decent job to have part-time but don't expect to have your back covered for you. Its not too difficult of a job itself, but what does matter is who your manager is. I've asked to get extra help in the warehouse but never received it. Offered suggestions on what to improve but was largely ignored. Be prepared to play along with management or you'll be looking for work elsewhere."
bad,"Working for BestBuy has shown me both the positives and negatives of working in a strong, customer- employee related relationship. Everyday is different. Situations are different. A regular day of work in the Product Process department would be to accept drop shipments into the stores inventory, organize and put out product on shelves, as well as eye catching placements and proper product handling (APG). Once a week, our department is recquired to change over ""signs"" for different paid vendors and events in store. Proper labelling such as price markers, changes in an items current state ( whether it's open box, damaged, return to vendor, exchange ect). Product process is also responsible for all items coming into the store from the warehouse, to being shipped out. Minor daily duties include cleaning of the warehouse, organizing and HUB (lunch room of associates)."
bad,You work all the time and the Holidays are even worst.  I was hired and during my training they fired over 15 managers from the location; including the General Manager.  This is a 65 million a year location.  Working 6 days a week is normal and working on your only day off from home is also normal.
bad,"I worked from home, which was obviously nice, but it doesn't allow for advancing in the company. Work-at-home positions at Best buy are limited. I also had to fight wage discrimination and won. I went from $14 hr to $16, but that was still about $1+ hr lower than what it should have been if it was truly fair and equal wages. I had to settle to keep my job. Management still catered to male employee advancements. I eventually just gave up and left. I'm not a disgruntled employee. It was a good job to have. I just know that there are many companies in the tech world that are willing to pay me fairly as a woman for my skills. Obviously, one would prefer to work with those companies instead."
bad,I participated in normal daily activities involving in the running of the store answering general customer inquiries weather in store or by phone and to offer the most suitable situation or action that leaves the customer happy I assisted in removing and changing displays and setting up promotions within the store
bad,"They'll teach you for a little bit, have you shadow an experienced employee. After that, good luck knowing the products on your own. Deliver your best information. If you have a smartphone with you, use that to your advantage as your ""superior"" product knowledge source."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"a typical job, managers care more about hitting numbers then anything else."
bad,Bad management in the battle creek mi store. Only one fifteen minute break per shift under eight hours. Anything eight or ok very is one thirty minute break.
bad,Best Buy is a great place to start for young man and woman looking to boast their sales and management. Customer interaction is the best part of the job.
bad,Make sure to work on the sales floor and kiss up to management. Any other position you are worked to the bone and given very little thanks. The attitude of the store is very much like a highschool. If thats something that interests you great. If you want a mature work environment then this store might not be for you.
bad,Great place for a tech savvy individual would like to work at.  Clients vary in positive or negative outlooks.  Nice to provide solutions to technology problems.  Management could show more care towards agents.  Unrealistic productivity goals
bad,"Not a very stable job for anyone lookling for a full time job. To be promoted to full time you need to pull some major cash revenue for the company and then IF they have a spot open and the supervisors like you enough, then you may have a chance."
bad,"My job consisted of assisting customers and answering questions about recommended video games.  I also worked at the cash register checking out customers when needed."
bad,"There is no room for advancement within the company. I learned that they were all about favoritism. The management would tell all types of lies and there were never informed about anything,"
bad,"Was promised at minimum 22 hours a week and continued work after the holiday rush. After Christmas, I was down to less than 10 hours a week and wasn't able to live. Pretty bad."
bad,"Best Buy is a fun first job as a kid to earn some cash, but it its not enough to accommodate living on your own. The management is poor and the career potential is very low. You quickly learn that the excitement of talking about tech to a customer is overshadowed by management constantly pressuring you to sell company exclusives (i.e. Credit cards, protection plans, Geek Squad services). The work life balance is poor."
bad,"Starting with the positives, I learned a lot, most of my coworkers were great, and I've genuinely met great people working at best buy."
bad,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo era llegar, hacer reunión mañanera y poder cantar nuestra porra."
bad,"Outside of the ridiculous sales goals for each person, pressuring  employees to sale to everyone who comes in the door and then open a credit card and pile it up is deplorable. And the customer review sheets that had to be filled out for each customer were troublesome, time consuming, and flat out stupid. Best Buy claimed it made the employee look more professional but in reality it just made the employee look unprepaird and forget of what a customer just told them."
bad,I was a seasonal employee here. I had interview upon interview trying to get into a part time position here. I interviewed for at least 15 different jobs there. Not one of them did I get. I sure did get the seasonal one though. Which I was told that if I make enough sales and do well enough I could get a permanent position. Doesn't sound too bad right? Wrong I got maybe a day and a half worth of training. Then I didn't see another shift for three months. My first day was the day before Thanksgiving. It was a short four hour shift. Then I had to come in at 3 PM on Thanksgiving day and was there till 4 in the morning. Then had to be back in at noon the next day. I was stuck in one section the whole time by myself. With just enough knowledge to get myself by. I saw maybe 3 more shifts before January. They told me they wanted to talk to me about getting a permanent position. Scheduled an interview with me. Said we would go over paperwork and stuff. So its an interview I got dressed up wanted to look my best. Just for them to give me an exit interview. Needless to say I did not like working here. I did not get treated very well most of the time. I was lied to and my hours were based on sales from what I was told.
bad,When I first started the company i was Full-time associate. it wasn't until a few months later when my position was removed from the company. Shortly after that my hours where reduced tremendously and that caused me to be in finical despair.
bad,"A typical day of work would include helping customers and selling them things they come in for."
bad,Not every store environment is the same. I actually enjoyed most of my coworkers. Management could use a lot more training. A lot of work was delegated to associates because of the lack of know-how from management. Mis-steps from management trickled down and affected associates' wages and hours. Company policy was blurred if it came directly from a manager while associates were put under a guillotine.
bad,"Working there is usually a fine day but let me tell you the management tends to be completely out of touch with lots of things. Customers, day to day work experiences and what is needed to motivate the average worker and more importantly consumer to take advantage of what Best Buy has to offer."
bad,"I worked with them twice.  I loved my original store in Baltimore MD.  The second one in northern DE was horrendous.  I was in loss prevention and they were just not a pleasant place to work.  2 of the 3 managers in my department, to which none were actual LP were great.  The overall was an overpaid sales jerk."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I was required to meet and greet incoming customers and help the company sell more. I was clean and friendly and neat. I the staff was always nice and helpful
bad,the manager was a regular harasser to all the women. We were trained to work competitive commission positions without the same pay. The managers were EXTREMELY unprofessional.
bad,"Overall Rating=2/5 Would recommend but unable to move up in the company since they also hire for management/supervisor position outside of the company, non flexible hours and no work/life balance available at this job, also poor management."
bad,I loved working here because I'm a tech fanatic. I love all the newest and brightest technological advancements. I would say my only complaint would be working in retail which I truly didn't enjoy. which is why I was really excited to switch to service.
bad,My usual work day was early mornings in which I changed daily price tags to ensure customers paid the correct amount for products purchased. There were always tasks to be completed and customers to assist. My position did not allow for much room for growth nor the option to complete more tasks than I was assigned.
bad,I worked in the Cellular department and was outcasted because I didn't fit the video game nerd stereotype and I didn't want to hook up with anyone. The whole store was dating each other. Was so click-y.
bad,It was a fairly decent place to work. I enjoyed the work and helping the customers. I like managing the schedules of the agents as well as working with the field to provide assistance with appointments etc
bad,"The company is very powerful but there motto is “have fun while being the best” when it should be “be the best”. Expectations grow to unrealistic standards very quickly. I get that companies are supposed to advance, but there is only so much growth one can expect in a certain area when a sister store is 10 minutes away. They do try to promote good benefits and culture but become cutthroat and disrespect the customer. They also commonly ask staff to do more work than what they are paid for. I learned a lot, and am thankful but they have to relax on the whole goals and standards thing or pay commission."
bad,Very high paced. Enjoy what I do and most of all the people. Hours are not great and they do not care about family life. As a part time employee your hours vary greatly every week.
bad,Management required minimum customers signing up for credit cards and other promotions.  Even the highest sales didn't exempt from requirement.  Hours were cut if you didn't make minimum.
bad,"The members of the team i was working on were not supportive of each other. Co-workers were withholding information from each other. A lot of people were bored at work, and were doing online shopping. People with questions at meetings were advised to leave the company."
bad,"I love the people at the job but there is somethings that the need work within the business. The management is not the best and they show favoritism to certain people that they like. I cannot work in an environment that is not fair with the work load, the discipline, scheduling and etc. The communication with in the customer service updates is terrible. No one will know about an update on anything unless it is mentioned to the leaders. The office is so unorganized and there is new hires training other new hires. This place just need some work to be a better operating company."
bad,"Great times around your fellow co-workers, management is generally ran poorly, creating an environment that often times begins to drag on you and can create unfair expectations due to pressure being placed on them."
bad,"This was a temporary position for me so I was not planning on staying here long anyway, definitely not a long term role for me. The people were nice but I was not there long."
bad,"Best Buy is a great place to learn new skills and put those skills into practice. "
bad,"While working for this computer you will quickly find out that you are easily replaceable, regardless of your performance. They are extremely quick to outsource work to other countries and companies. The coworkers are a great asset, but management needs to view their subordinates as people and not bonus machines."
bad,Great job for students. Not good long term unless you're going for GM. Great place to learn to communicate with customers and gain sales experience. Also nice to learn multiple fields in the work place.
bad,They wants to do your best without any improvement in your post position. As all admire my work but they don't expect employee to demand good position. More ober they give hardly 12 hour in a week.
bad,I would not recommend this to anyone in the Dublin location. The management is not able to work with their workers and are not understanding. They do not pay well for the work that is done and it is very stressfull.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it, After awhile you will see what the company for what it really is, paying you the least while do the most. There is no incentive for the employee to work to the best of their abilities"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Best Buy pretty much has you on call which is fine but then it gets excessive. Do not give set hours as a part timer. They over hire so expect little to no hours.If you are looking to work at least 16 hours a weeks good luck no way thats gonna happen even if you request more hours. Managements drives you incredibly hard. expectations are incredibly high. Also too many managers i didnt even know who was in charge. You learn selling skills but thats it.
bad,"There is lack of management, low pay rate and people quit in high numbers. The atmosphere is vulgar and you have to find your way with the management.  I had a productive relationship with the store manager, assistant store manager and department supervisor."
bad,Scheduling has no routine to it. Only lower management is given full time hours and benefits. Upper management is infrequently on location and usually not available to help with day to day business.
bad,Job is fun however there is no security what so ever. They will just replace you with someone willing to take less money than you. A good job for a college students or highschool that do need that many hours.
bad,"Best Buy's management is not take into account the outside lives of their part time employees. There were many times where I had a shift scheduled until 10:00p.m., and I was kept there past 4:00 a.m. and told I couldn't leave until the truck was finished.  I had a much better experience as an employee at the Meriden Best Buy as opposed to the North Haven Best Buy."
bad,"Best Buy is a good college job, and usually they will work with you on balancing your personal and work time.  You will also learn a lot about electronics and up to date software."
bad,"as a customer service specialist a regular day consisted of assisting customers with returns/ online orders/cashier duties. i havent really learned anything from the job itself but more learned something more about myself that i can be very welcoming and easy to talk to with customers. ive noticed this because since i was hired ive been leading the store in most customer surveys for 100% and i know i can keep any client happy. the culture of the job is kind of sell, sell, sell. which is funny because on our core values as a company it wants us to have fun while being the best but when they would always like for you to upsell everything you can annoy any customer. management is close to non-existent they let you normally figure things out yourself and lots of times when you ask for help they dont know the answer either. the hardest part of the job was to stay motivated managers kind of bring you down when you tell them of hopes you have on moving up and there are favorites that will always get chosen before you. most enjoyable part of my day is when im able to really make a customer laugh or we connect and its nice to be at work and have fun."
bad,"knowing new technology was fun and exciting, seeing new things every year. besides the tech, the coworkers were the reason the job experience wasn't terrible especially dealing with customers. that was the hardest part of the job. customers would flip out if we didn't have a certain item in stock. But management was frustrating to deal with, they didn't know how to communicate to employees, and didnt care about employees well being. its rude and unethical."
bad,"Many company policies make the job harder than it needs to be, poor company direction, poor treatment via management, extremely difficult to promote more than a few steps. Management should remember that the people under you are actual people rather than hours that you need to cut in order to engorge your own bonuses."
bad,"I love the coworkers, that's about it. I've made some good friends but this place is so kiss a** it's insane. The management is borderline sociopathic and they tell you they'll work with you but then throw it back in your face. I was full time and requested to go down to part time because I still needed a job but didn't want to be around my lead as much as I was. "
bad,"Management only cares about profit, no compassion towards employees, peers are on drugs, lots of unskilled employees, you are treated like you are a little kid."
bad,Companies policies and culture are only design to enhance the company's revenue. Does not fully care for their employees..
bad,"Best Buy can be a fun place to work for a short period of time, however, it is not a place to work for any extended period. They constantly restructure, cutting positions and putting more responsibility on lower paid positions. The management is hit or miss depending on store location and feel of the district and territory staff. If managers and employees get along, higher ups decide they need to shift things around to keep them fresh instead of letting what is working continue to work. Hours are sporadic, in keeping with retail jobs, but also not guaranteed. In recent years they have also made a big shift towards a commission type of sales floor, without compensating the sales staff for meeting the new demands. They are quick to harp on under performance however and quickly take away hours for not meeting the goals. It is a place that one can learn a lot from, both in product knowledge and in how to be a team player and even leader, but the higher level management does not realize who actually brings in all the money for the company."
bad,The people and culture at Best Buy are great to be around and most are fun to work for. The job itself is fairly simple and enjoyable while still being a professional place to work. The downside is the management at most stores is terrible. In each store there seems to be a clique of management and privileged employees that benefit from special treatment. I enjoyed working there for the first 6 months until everything became a popularity contest and then I decided to leave. I hope that the management of the company has gotten better since because it used to be a fun place to work.
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but management only cared if you made the company money otherwise they treat you bad. Breaks were far and few between.
bad,"My love for electronics led me to the doors of best buy, but I was met with an unappreciative management team whose soul goal were to make numbers on their nearly blank pages better. You may find amazing co-workers, but ultimately you will be disappointed in the company as most of its costumers are. Only by paying their employees fairly can they better, but a year has shown me that they will try to raise profits by selling as many over priced items as possible while cutting costs everywhere."
bad,The company leadership forces the store level management to bend to customer will at all times. They don't really care about the lower level employees because they feel anybody can be replace. The lower level employees mean nothing.
bad,"It was my first job, and it was exactly that, a job. Nothing that I'd write home about. Bossy managers, and shady corporate ideals."
bad,"scheduling is more of a rough draft at all times, will get called in on almost all days off and if you do not come in your hours will get cut drastically. They do not fire anyone, including if you are an hour+ late multiple times, call out for a week straight, or even if you do not do your job. Co-workers are hit and miss, some try their hardest and show up ready to work everyday, others do none of these things. Will put you in a department/ position you do not want to be in and will tell you it is temporary until you quit. Management is friendly to you and will be understanding to your face, but will disregard any talks the next day."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Working in the warehouse, I learned how to be organized and work quickly with products. Unloading the stores truck to separate each item to there departments is a challenging job but it helped me to move quickly and efficiently. While storing items in the sales floor, i helped with customers and finding items they were seeking for."
bad,Unless you make friends with the right people there is little for advancement. The work is generally simple. Good for young people. Not great for a long term career.
bad,"Your basic retail job, they want to work you like a commission sales person but not reward you for it. hourly salary but you have to push their plan on people so its high pressure sales."
bad,"The one thing I hated the most about working here was the constant requirements to sell, get credit card apps etc. I am morally opposed to forcing a credit card on someone who doesn't need one or want one. The managers would constantly come up to me in the middle of a sale and try to force the credit card down their throat. Also they would often act as if your sale numbers were always unsatisfactory. Not to mention we don't get commission, instead we get STI. STI is based on the total store revenue and raises your hourly pay by up to 150%. supposedly encouraging teamwork, but really allowing laziness among many while others actually try to be actually helpful and give the customers what they want."
bad,"It is possible to move up within the company, but you have to make sure all of your ""t's"" are crossed and all of your ""i's"" are dotted. You have to try to get fired, but the culture is geared towards high schoolers and college students. Avoid if looking to advance a sales or IT career. This is retail at it's finest, and worst."
bad,"Work with a good team, but it's difficult to become Full time if your in school.  The only people that can work full time and go to school are the Supervisors or above. Compensation sucks especially if your not getting hours."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of two major factors, Incoming clients, and their carious computers that must be taken care of. The problems can range from physical damage all the way to numerous corruptions within their operating system. I've learned many things about how different operating systems function, as well as various tools that i can use to solve many of the problems that I have come across. The management is where this job begins to decline. Having experience to fix computers, but to be only be driven by making a sale, is not what I want to do at this current job. The hardest part of the job will be dealing with the company strive to make money, when all you may want to di is fix a computer with a simple issue."
bad,"Don't feel that I have grown or used my potential to further myself or improve with other products and electronics. Always kept in one section -- cellular phones. They expect you to succeed or exceed your productivity, yet almost struggling when they give you other tasks which requires of more importance. The best part of working there is with the team and co workers"
bad,"Leadership was not engaged with subordinates and job advancement seemed to not be a focus. Routinely would stress about sales goals, but seldom would provide a course of action to attain these goals. Rarely would be recognized for good deeds and would regularly work 44 or more hour work weeks for little pay.."
bad,"fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of such a big company."
bad,"Management is contradicting"
bad,"I want to like this job. The daily experience at Best Buy is constantly changing because every customer has different needs and it is extremely satisfying to close sales and deliver great solutions to customers. I loved my coworkers and my bosses because everyone has each others' back when customers complain and the leadership always pulls through to save you when you make a mistake. Also there is a great employee discount that makes ALL electronics super cheap. But really this is where the greatness ends."
bad,"Typical day at work consist of trouble shooting home PC users."
bad,Ive learned alot from my coworkers at geek squad. And I love the Geek Squad brand. But I think Best Buy Is actually ruining Geek Squad as a business. Instead of providing customers with Tech support its more about selling customers things. As the manager I understand Sales is very important. But Best Buy wants sales first and customer service last.
bad,Best Buy has a very good program in place to provide employees with Product Knowledge necessary to provide excellent service. Company is too concerned about selling and not concerned enough about keeping product in stock for customers to purchase. Pricing strategies of organization offend my sensibilities.
bad,Best Buy is mangled well and does provide customer services but its services being provided are often lacking and will not make customers happy in long run
bad,"A place where your coworkers are supportive but downtrodden, where management caves to angry, entitled customers. Geek Squad is not a place for creative types; if you hate uniforms and fail to fit in, you're not ""committed"" enough."
bad,"varied duties, follow company structure. overall not my favorite place of work. For some they may like it .It has been a while different management there now"
bad,"Unfortunately, I cannot rate my Best Buy experience as favorable one. There is virtually no training given to new associates, it is either swim or sink. Also, the system for deliveries is confusing and allowed to double book a item in warehouse. For example if there is one item left in warehouse, system allows multiple parties to place an order upon it and as result only one customer will receive the item, which creates problems for the rest of the asociates as the customers who paid will not receive their item and vent frustration upon us."
bad,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers here, but on any typical day you were told how much you sucked by at least one manager. No real way of improving unless you get it from a co-worker or beg a manager to help teach you."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"From what I've heard from previous co-workers, the few perks we had working there (in employee discounts) have been slashed dramatically. It is non commissioned pay, so even if you are really good at your job, there is little incentive, other than managers asking you to work even harder for better numbers."
bad,This was not the job for me and not what I thought it was going to be. I'm used to customer facing positions and am looking towards getting back to what I know and love to do.
bad,"Repetitive work that will make you numb. Since there is no commission there is 0 incentive. They advertise that we want to help people make the best purchase and that we are zero commissioned, therefore, we are good honest people when in reality they hire people who know nothing about the product at low wages where the only thing we really want to do is go on break. Working in customer service, you hear a lot of people complaining about items that aren't life threatening, but these people make it seem like their whole world will crumble if they don't get that TV for 20% off, or that computer for a 100$ off."
bad,"The best part of my job was learning to process the back office paperwork and count the deposit. I would make sure the deposit matched the amount of cash that was earned for the previous day. If it was off, even by a penny, I would document it and higher quantities I would figure out what happened with the money (if it was negative or positive). My co-workers make my job more enjoyable, we all have fun and can rely on each other to help out when needed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer escalations on issues that are out of my control, however, I am always curiosity and explain the situation the best that I can and stick to the policy that is given to us."
bad,"When I worked there, It started out alright, they would schedule a shift for 7 and 1/2 hours, so you weren't required to have a lunch break, that is fine and all but most shifts I worked like that, not only did I not get to leave when my shift was over, i wasn't given't that lunch break, we would work for 10 hours even though our shift ended 2 and 1/2 hours ago, Once I asked to leave well after my shift ended and they literally wouldn't let me leave. I wouldn't recommend working at this corporation."
bad,"Typical day at work would require self learning on products to sell to rude impatient customers all while being hassled by management while little help was protruded."
bad,Best Buy allows future movement and growth within the company.
bad,"Long days, long holiday seasons. Can be okay if you get into a good store."
bad,Really depends on which store you work in. But expect long hours and little pay.
bad,"Work EVERY FRIDAY, SATURDAY 1-11 & SUNDAY 11-9 except one weekend per month!! 11-8 or 12-10 is your shift the rest of the week. No time for kids or family! They don't care!! "
bad,At first it was a good job to start off with. I knew it was part time going in but what I didn't know that I would remain part time permenently. I was told advancement depended on my skills but I did the best job I could and wasn't allowed to advance and I've been there over a year. I had a reduction from five days a week to only 2 which did not help my financial situation. I can not say I enjoyed my time there. Only perk I had was FREE movies every once in a while...
bad,Work at your own pace and no responsibilities. This job is great for people who aren't easily motivated.
bad,The company restructures (mass lay-offs) every now and then. There is little room to move up unless you join the favoritism club. Most store managements never finish college. All new hires start as part-time with little/no benefits. The good thing about the job is the employee discounts on certain electronics and accessories.
bad,"The coworkers were great and there was a family-like environment between all workers on the floor, but management was not always helpful when it came to handling scheduling issues. Hours were plentiful until the new year, after which they often dropped to under 10 a week for most workers on the floor - some workers were only put on the schedule for 1 day out of a week, while told that new hires were going to be trained."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy for the most part. It did have it's fair share of downsides though. On a typical day I was normally doing my job as well as 2-3 other peoples jobs while still getting paid the same amount, which after almost 5 years was no where near competitive and was honestly just enough to live pay check to pay check. There were only a few managers that I really liked but they did not last very long which is too bad because they showed that they really cared about the employees as people and didn't see them as sales people. The benefits for full timers are pretty good as far as insurance and every employee gets a really good discount but as far as bonuses and things of that nature unless you work on the sales floor you don't really get anything which I never thought was fair. Even an of the contests the store would have were all sales based and just kind of left everyone else out. The store is a basically a giant toy store which does make it fun to work at. Only downside is there really isn't much for job security no matter how long you've worked there they won't think twice about getting rid of you."
bad,Work with a lot of great people and help customers with sweet products.  On the other hand pay is bad and opportunities for advancement are rare.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"The spirit there is nice very happy to be there, and as always retail is retail and can be busy. I think the hardest part is the long hours, away from my friends and family and as much as I enjoy the work and the costumers, its something good to do as a part time job and nothing more."
bad,A fun place to work. I learned valuable sales experience there.
bad,Really don't care about their employees more about profit.
bad,not enough pay can never move up they also play favorites not great benefits
bad,The best part of my job was the customer because you have customer that know exactly what they want and just need to cash the out and then you have customers that have no idea
bad,Best Buy mobile is a company that is focused on numbers not employee relations.
bad,"I worked at BBY for a long time and saw many, many changes. I know not every store was the same as the one I worked at. Management....some were fantastic. They wanted you to succeed and coached you in the way that made sense to you. Other management.....not so much. Some were just crooked and had no morals. The hardest part of the job was the holidays. I know you get that with any retail position though. Best part, many of the people."
bad,"Let me begin by saying that Best Buy was (and possibly still is) in my top 3 favorite stores in the world. Between that and the benefits (primarily the employee discount), of course I thought I would enjoy my time working for them. This wasn't the case. Perhaps I'm not meant for sales, but if pushing UNNECESSARY products and services on my customers is what it takes then you can count me out. We were daily, no, hourly rated by our numbers and expected to pile on as much as humanly possible into each shopping cart. I worked in the Home Theater department (TVs, Audio, etc.) and there were a bunch of really cool things of which I could see the value, but after I had mentioned the service or product to the customer and learned that they weren't interested, I'm not going to badger them! Additionally I was sick (so sick I couldn't stand up) two days before July 4th, called in 3 hours in advance so help could arrive, and then later that evening was called back and suspended for 2 weeks w/o pay for missing work. I went to speak with the General Manager the next day and was told that doctor's note or not, I cost him thousands of dollars in sales that day and that I was still suspended."
bad,"was simple, job was to take orders from the front or through the window, keep work environment clean, and to provide sincere customer service"
bad,"I was hired for a seasonal position, once Christmas was over, they let 100 of the 105 people hired go. I enjoyed working & meeting the regular employees & my bosses were great."
bad,"All I really need to say is that you don't need to work here if you like technology. work somewhere you will get commission. It's no good to work for ""bonuses"" that end up being 45 -80 extra bucks a month. Not to mention if you work for this company you will most likely be working for an under qualified manager. all of mine were."
bad,"Its the most HORRIBLE place to work, the business is very unorganized and the lack in managerial skills and training ethics."
bad,Management is horrible and has no concern for individuals. You are all peons in their eyes.
bad,"Typical work day for Product Process would start with sweeping the entire front of the store, emptying trash containers in front, restrooms and ""the hub"", helping to downstock departments that had out of stocks on the shelves, unloading trucks; receiving shipments and stocking in warehouse or on floor. Answering inventory calls over the headset constantly and quickly. Helping to load customer's purchases into vehicle or bring heavy return/repair items into the store. I learned that Bestbuy is a very fast paced workplace, more so in season. Management left us to supervise each other. No real accountability on their behalf. Co-workers for the most part were self starters and hard workers. The veterans are valuable resources. The toughest part was trying to answer multiple calls when working alone due to lack of coverage. Most enjoyable was how time would pass by quickly when the work was being completed correctly"
bad,"Fast paced workplace, especially during the holiday season."
bad,"Best Buy obviously has its share of problems that were made public in the media recently. Seems like they might be trying to fix things now, though it is likely too late."
bad,"Constantly expected to be doing something (not a problem). Very busy atmosphere for most stores. Especially Geek Squad precincts. Most stores usually feel very understaffed. Expect to work in other departments that you weren't hired in while still finishing all of your job responsibilities. Management can be hit or miss. Most I find to be bad leaders that will look for scape goats to put the blame on. Also overly obsessed with business metrics, and severely corrupt sales tactics. Not looking out for the customers interests, only the businesses. If it just so happens that this is also the customers then they'll help you. When it comes to sales they want to rip everyone off. I realize this is a business and it runs on money but they're driving their clientele away. I don't expect this company to be around for another 5-10 years unless a major restructuring and reevaluation of what the company offers is changed."
bad,"The compensation is good, but they act like they own you. Furthermore, it's a good job, as far as,....unless you get on the bad side of the district staff, then you should just quit....District will ride you right out the door. If you play the political game and let them dominate your time without any resistance you are the greatest......Just don't have a family and plan to see them and work here.....Every week there is a new plan, or flavor of the day...."
bad,its ok but im looking for something better. its not what i want to do for the rest of my life.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Great starter job, but after college there is no rum to move up and the sales are being crushed by online sales and Walmart."
bad,"its an ok place to start off, I was only there until I was finally able to get my degree then I quickly left because nobody wants to advance beyond what they are capable of."
bad,"You could basically get paid the same to work at Walmart or Target and do a LOT less work. You’ll feel like you’re doing way too much work for the pay year in and out, especially as you get better. Once they see you want to move up, they’ll use you up and burn you out. Bad employees and high school kids that work there with terrible work ethic, can effect your pay and bonuses even if you’re doing really well. Good benefits though."
bad,"Just generally had a bad experience, lots of stuff was not good. Particularly, the management, which was hit or miss. A lot of the managers were really great, but there were a few managers that just ruined the whole thing for everyone, and made life more difficult that it needed to be, and I hated it. Had to quit as soon as I could."
bad,"Retail in itself is known for long hours during holidays. Be prepared. "
bad,"Management was either great or very bad. Very pressured to hit goals every day. Worked too much and had too many responsibilities for the pay, workers and management were rarely on the same page, management also liked to tell you what you wanted to hear, etc.."
bad,"...it was okay, scheduling was fairly consistent. Discounts were nice  advancement was very tough. Management was pretty fair for the most part, and trainings galore."
bad,"Worked here for a while, was interested in the growing field of technology, loved the aspect of the company just hated the way the management was enforcing and demanding us for more credit cards and the scams they would use to lure more people into their deceptive lies. Also disliked the way all management would go and take smoke breakers almost every hour on the clock but yet limited employees to to 15 min breaks only"
bad,Management only interested in getting the job done and inquires when no explanation for NOT doing overtime was given. No wonder there is so much turnaround.
bad,"Management is unethical and shady. Have had two general managers now. First one was fired for HR/ harassment issues and the new GM is now trying to weed anyone he can out to bring his friends in, and there is absolutely no work-life balance. If you don't live, sleep, breathe Best Buy you are treated to be an idiot."
bad,"I have never before been to a workplace environment that had as much favoritism among different departments. The sales floor and the warehouse are treated as differently as night/day. There are several contests that only sales can actually participate in. Honestly, the management overall is either very poor or doesn't have enough influence to change anything."
bad,Management is tough on the employees and most of the sales goals are ridiculously hard to hit. Not much room to move up and not always hired within. Benefits were pretty good.
bad,"There is alot of favoritism.  They don't seem to appreciate your work"
bad,LOVED IT AT FIRST!!! new management came in breaking up families with no care whats so ever now the work place has become a anger filled pit of fire trash envoirment please don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,they close stores all the time and then its just like bam.. no job and you never see it coming. I left be out of the blue our store was closed and every other store was full....
bad,I loved working at Best Buy it was a very fun learning experience with the access to technological growth and development. Peers worked well with each other as long as management stayed on track with both online training on products and monthly coaching. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with sales goals and expectations when numbers were against all odds. The employees always had the task of having to meet and exceed the previous years sales goals or compete with other stores. I would say overall the competitiveness and the inconsistent schedule was the conflicting part of the job. The most enjoyable part was when the customer would walk away with a smile on their face and they would even want to fill a positive survey on me (the employee).
bad,"Federal Way, WA Best Buy is the most unorganized store ever. Managment is lazy. But Discount ia great. Schedule is always all over the place, always hires from outside, impossible to go higher from position you started at"
bad,Best Buy management is full of politics. They care not for your talents and only promote the people in their cliques. They don't consider performance or knowledge when conducting promotions. They consider how much they like you as an individual.
bad,"Best Buy is for young college students or High school students. In this job, you really cant advance especially if your a sales associate. The job pace is slow and some times can pick up, but it isn't an ideal job to work long time, unless you are on the corporate end of it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"A lot of management's ""toy money"" comes from bonuses. However, management is not required to make any sales, or contribute to meeting or exceeding budget. Therefore if you're an excellent sales person and have the ability to hammer a credit card application in to your customers whether they want it or not, your manager becomes your best friend. However, if you work on OPs or don't work directly on the sales floor, you are unfortunately chopped liver and put as last priority for everything."
bad,"Work place is very similar to High School. Management is hot garbage. Immature managers that still act like high schoolers even though they are in their 30s. Discount kind of makes up for it. easy job, horrible management. Not enough hours unless your full time(mandatory 40hrs per week, 8 hr shifts only)"
bad,I learned about all the televisions best buy would sell. I learned about the sounds. Management was not that great. Hardest part of the job was trying to learn everything and not having an efficient way of learning. I enjoyed learning about the products. Overall I felt that it was just very unorganized and there was no real foundation of selling the product. Plus I did not agree with their selling strategy was trying to sell the customer something that was way over their budget and unnecessary. I just believed in selling a product to the customer that suited them perfectly.
bad,Love my supervisors and most of upper management but unfortunately I was not a fan of the overall team efficiency. People seemed to be in it for themselves rather then a team effort.
bad,"Management was horrible, a lot of hours cut from employees. They will judge you on your NPS and NOT on your sales and sales tactics. They will always find ways to yell at you for doing your job."
bad,"No training process. Had to ask a million questions like a lost child, which can make you feel like a burden. Some of the “expert” employees get attitudes when you ask them questions about something in their department, for a customer. Wasn’t put on schedule for a whole month, even after reaching out multiple times. Most of the employees were very nice, down to earth people, but some had stuck up attitudes just because they were seasoned workers. I did get register training but wasn’t given any register authorized number codes for weeks, so I still felt useless."
bad,"You will work all holidays, and typically be asked to help in departments you dont know. You will meet some great people but the hours are not great. Management is very performance orientated for not being a commission based job."
bad,Its gets boring when u have to stand around waiting for stuff to come to your work station and then have to wait for everyone to get done before u can leave
bad,"Es una empresa con muchas flexibilidades para estudiantes, madres y/o amas de casa, ademas de contar con un programa de remuneración atractivo y en muchas de sus áreas se tiene la oportunidad de explotar el potencial y adquirir aprendizaje, experiencias y nuevas habilidades que te pueden servir para posteriores empleos, y tratan de mantener un equilibrio entre clientes y empleados."
bad,"Not interested in reviewing a typical day at Best Buy, or what I learned while working there, or anything about management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job or most enjoyable."
bad,"Management on a departmental basis was sub-par, the computer lead didn't know much of anything about computers and could only train you on how to sell the service package. "
bad,"Wont deal with bad managers. Run who they don't like out of the store. Discount is good, 401 K is offered, paid time off is good if you can manage to stick it out with bad managers"
bad,"The environment at Best Buy was decent and fun to be a part of. My Co-Workers were some of the best I have met so far. Although the work place may have been alright, most practices were almost off-putting as we were working stressful hours and receiving almost no credit for our work for minimal pay. Working during holidays such as thanksgiving and black Friday gave us no additional benefit with the heavily increased work load for those days."
bad,"The pay is low, with poor hours and little flexibility. Employees aren't kept an eye on, leading to horseplay during work hours. Customers are not treated with respect, and instead are scammed into purchasing plans that do not fit them."
bad,"The title says it all."
bad,My time working for Best Buy was not as great as my other experiences working for other companies. I did not feel welcomed and did not feel comfortable. I also was asked to quit because the employers could not accommodate my schedule with my school schedule.
bad,"Retail sucks, plain and simple. I you NEED a job, then sure Best Buy will work. Unless you aspire to be a store manager, which is stressful beyond belief, then there's really no advancement. You can barely move laterally within the company. I dread going to work. If you have the means, stay away."
bad,"I worked in the backroom at Best Buy for 6 months and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Backroom workers were treated with very little respect by the management while having one of the most physical demanding jobs at the store.  When it comes to the scheduling, my store had the horrible habit of scheduling me to work truck one night that usually ends around midnight or even 2 am on a rare occasion only to come back and open hours later.  There was an incident at my location where on of the managers came into the back room grabbed all of the chairs that we had at the desk and threw and broke them down into the trash compacter because he thought we were not doing our job fast enough. It was a very unpleasant experience."
bad,Not university student friendly.    You have little control over how many hours you limit yourself to.   The best part of the job were the co-workers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,The company when I first started was great but over the course of my time with the company it change for the worst.  Discount dwindled and benefits became sparse.
bad,"I like working there but managers show favortism to people they like.  They do not treat high performers well if you are not in their clique.  Its a great part time job but not long term.  If management see you as a threat to taking their job, they will find ways to fire you.  I love the people I worked with, even the managers that were treating me unfairly. They are good people but not good managers.  If it was not for favortism and the lack of a way of moving up the ladder, it would be a good long term job as well.  I just was not one of those who kissed up to managers and was a star at what I did - customer service and driving credit card apps and insurance.  I would have made a good upper manager but I was not favored by the upper manager group there.  Again, I loved the people, but they did not feel the same toward me."
bad,"Most of the difficulty of working at Best Buy was do to the stock market crash in 2008. Prior to that it was a secure, fun and exciting place to work. When the stock market crashed things became pretty scary and in 2014 Best Buy had an operational shift which including removing the supervisor position entirely."
bad,"I was not given an orientation nor proper training. I was thrown into the job and it was very stressful. After I was asked if I would like to be kept for permanent from temporary, I was let go 5 days later because they didn't have hours for me. I was also denied my two 15-minute/ half hour breaks when working a full 8-hour shift."
bad,In the beginning I loved the place. Everyone was super fun and chill and if you did something wrong they'd let you know. Then the entirety of the management flipped over in a year's time and now I hate the place. All the managers are passive aggressive and reward people for doing the bare minimum but forbid going above and beyond because you will not be recognized. You also won't be recognized for messing something up. Either nothing will be done about it or they will passive aggressively hate you basically until you leave. The most enjoyable part of this job is leaving.
bad,"Its a great job to bring out your people skills but as far as feeling you did something good for the day, not so much. Unfullfiling. To many chiefs and not enough indians"
bad,"none.  Best Buy is a good ENTRY level position.  I have 20 + years.  BBY locked my salary and I did not receive a raise because I was ""capped"" so regardless of my productivity for the past 3 years."
bad,"great place to work if youre in highschool, because thats what it feels like. management is always changing and never stable work environment. great temp job."
bad,"The workday started at 6: oo am and end at 10, 12 or even later."
bad,you ask for hours they wont give you any. tell them your going through a hard time and you need hours. they wont help. only reason to work here is cause the discount
bad,not a place id want to move up. its too much like... high school. a lot of BS and it just gets really annoying. otherwise the pay is not great but the work is usually minimal
bad,"I was at Geek Squad for three and a half years.  I was dismissed and found out later that week that my department was being eliminated.  No doubt, my dismissal was to avoid having to pay me any severance.  I do want to emphasize that my immediate manager had nothing to do with this.  He is a fine man."
bad,"Upper management left the company as whole in trouble, mix that with big box stores going under and a lot of good people were laid off (I got the second round of layoffs). They tried to open too many stores to compensate and then couldn't keep their heads above water. They hire kids, without even a A+ certification, off the floor to be techs on computers. Was a Home Theatre Installer, and my layoff came with an option to be rehired at a severe loss of pay or severance package."
bad,Pretty good seasonal work for young adults. Management had a high turnover rate. Inventory room associates did not enjoy same benefits as cashiers and salesman.
bad,Management was not the best and not a very flexible schedule. Required to work all holidays except Christmas/Easter and many times I was scheduled 7-14 days without a day off. Break schedule was a mess and many times I would even miss my lunch break because there would be nobody to cover me.
bad,"I learned a lot, I met a lot of cool people. I worked my but off but my work was not given any appreciation besides a pat on the back. I was promised a raise multiple times and never received one."
bad,Lentreprise ne se contente pas beaucoup du service a la clientele seulement de leur vente
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"In the 7 months I've worked here, I have never been properly and fully trained in many aspects of my job. A lot of what I know, i was told how to do by friends and co-workers because I asked them. "
bad,i am a very hands on kind of person. i am very diverse in my mechanical knowledge.
bad,"ideal beginner job. great for those with no other responsibilities. I learned a lot about technology. co-workers were helpful, managers too busy to assist. somewhat favoritism in the departments. Hardest part of my job was giving forth 100% at my job and not being recognized. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
bad,"I hadn't worked at Best Buy for very long. My first few months were spent on a computer where I took numerous training courses that didn't apply to the position I was hired for. I wasn't able to start my Sales Floor training until I had my computer courses completed. Once I finally made it out onto the sales floor, I was paired up with a few associates to go over the basics of the products and the layout of the store and the departments. After that, I was on my own to greet and assist any customers that came into my department. Any questions I had about certain products were left unanswered as the fellow associates and managers were usually too busy juggling customers throughout the store. Every day felt the same. "
bad,Best Buy was a great place to work. Over the 5 years that i worked there i learned a lot and strengthened my skills as a person. Met and made a lot of friendships wouldn't change it for the world.
bad,I was not happy with the management or advancement opportunity with this company.
bad,"Working for Best Buy was okay at times, but mostly there was an incredible amount pressure to sell to customers that were just not there. What I mean by that is, when sales numbers were low, it didn't matter that only 40 people had come into the store that day. It was our fault that we couldn't close a huge deal with the few that did come in. Most of the time people didn't want to buy a $5,000 TV, they just wanted to get some $3 gummy head phones."
bad,"Working at Best Buy in the Customer Service Department has allowed me to meet different cultures and age groups. I have learn to adapt the skills to what is needed for the client. Which I enjoy greatly. "
bad,answered phone calls and assisted guest with product and dealt with online orders
bad,"Best Buy is a great place for a 2nd job, but not a place to make your career. I loved working with people and the employees however being in a corporate business, you have the chance to be taken advantage of."
bad,"The amount of work i had to do in this department was not worth the pay.  We were ALWAYS understaffed and we even needed to skip our lunch breaks.  Even though my supervisor was very strict, he made sure I had the knowledge to achieve my goals."
bad,"I started the job back in August and loved it at first. I was able to provide exceptional customer service and help people find the technological solutions that would last them rather than just pushing for certain items. My customers are always very satisfied because I pride myself on being down-to-Earth and very honest with them about product. As such, it keeps them coming back. For the most part, I enjoy my co-workers, many of them having similar interests outside of work that we can converse about during slow times or breaks. On top of that, many of them work just as hard and have the same concerns that I have about the management. The management at this particular BestBuy plays favorites rather strongly, often acts two-faced, and much to my chagrin, the general manager makes comments that step way out of line, often making many of the employees feel down and uncomfortable about ever approaching him again. The hardest part of my job is probably keeping up with the revenue per hour stipulation. While we're not on commission, we're still told to sell like we are and with the area the store is in, it's certainly tough sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to constantly learn more about technology and to help customers in a satisfying and honest manner. Because of that, I have several repeat customers now because of the report I have built with them and it feels great."
bad,"I was an okay company I just want better "
bad,"It is a great company to work for when there is no restructuring taking place. I like the job that I am in now but with the restructure taking place, I am given a severance of 2 weeks pay whereas a district manager received a years pay for her severance."
bad,"Even till this day, as a Best Buy customer, I have a bad experience. I hate to speak negatively of a company but I'd be lying if they dont prove their short-comings time and time again. Schedule could contain 40hrs one weak and 8hrs they next, this did not depend on performance either. I dont need to go any further than that."
bad,Typical work day consists of a multitasking. Manager was very unprofessional. Co Workers were very helpful and understandable. Hardest part of the job was stacking the tvs.Satisfying in helping the customer get wat they want within their budgets.
bad,the managment is one of teh worse at any job i have ever worked at due to not one manger having the same format as teh other you are consatly being told to do one thing by one manager and the oppiste by another
bad,"A typical day at work is ""SELL, SELL, SELL!!!."" I learned that no matter how hard you try, it probably isn't good enough. Management is always on your case about making sales. Your co-workers are generally lazy and don't really care. The hardest part of the job is making the insane revenue they expect you to make in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in an enviornment that revolves around technology, and the discounts."
bad,"Best Buy was a stepping stone to the reality of business and finances.  The knowledge I received from the great people around me allowed me to grow in sales, but the fluctuations of managers and the implementations of products was difficult to follow.  I did appreciate that the supervisors I had were eager to involve me in daily department operations such as financials, planogram organizations, advertising development, and supervisor duties.  Though pay was small and there were no bonuses for reaching budget in sales or margin.  "
bad,"its ok to work there. fun atmosphere, nice people, good management. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Position required effective support to service representatives, when the Customer Service Supervisor was not available in addition to advocating Best Buy goals, objectives, policies, and procedures in efforts to deliver a high level of customer satisfaction and retention. Successfully demonstrated excellent skills in performing all customer transactions and in resolving difficult customer service issues. Love my manager, just dislike the gossip with other department managers.Co-workers best department in the building.The hardest part of my job was seeing customers upset when items could not be fixed and they didn't get the insurance policy."
bad,Fun environment.
bad,"After nearly 2 decades of service I have seen just about everything with this company. The ups, the downs and all in between. I have seen wonderful and horrible people come and go but what I put up with in this market with this company got to be too much. I've seen sexual harassment by managers towards 16 year old girls be common knowledge, GM and AMs collude to torment a specific employee they did not like personally (regardless of their work performance), I've witnessed a manager vandalize an employees car when drunk, theft of products and services and giving the same away to friends and I have seen a manager repeated scream and yell using every obscenity in the book towards an employee or vendor rep in front of other employees and customers. I have also been personally threatened with physical assault by a manager. All of these situations and more have been reported to HR representatives and have led to investigations but we always get told that it was our word against theirs - no matter how many witnesses there were. The most outrageous part is the fact that these managers are all close personal friends of the district manager who oversees the HR manager for the district. It is well known that he has protected these people as it has become a joke among employees. This District Manager prides himself on his ability to protect his friends. I get that this is retail and that there are a lot of stresses with the service industry but these antics that persist are not acceptable. For a company that wants to turn itself around there need to hold these leaders more accountable to"
bad,In order to get anywhere for this company you have to suck up to management because your numbers aren't important to them to consider you for a promotion.
bad,"On a typical day I was in charge of equipment and product sales tactics. If customers called I was required to answer any over the phone questions they had on computer hardware, software and electronic issues with solutions that would satisfy them. The hardest part of this was that I was not paid a technicians salary but it was enjoyable to be able to help customers fix the problems and concerns they had and make them a satisfied customer to return to Best Buy. Customers were usually very eager to learn or educate."
bad,"Pay is good, but they keep scheduling me on days that I can't work. I've put in availability requests FOUR times and they still keep scheduling me for those days. It also took them like a whole month and a half to schedule me for training after the date I was hired. I hardly ever get work hours. I only get discounts on a few things like computer accessories; I have to pay for computers and such full price. The management sucks, my supervisor doesn't take his job seriously, and I feel like my store doesn't really follow its supposed values very well. I'm going to school full time, and having to learn a TON of information is really stressful. Thinking of looking for another job. :/"
bad,"I work in the musical instruments department and irresponsible parents drop their kids off to shop. I have to clean more than sell instruments. Let's face it, who's coming into Best Buy to buy a guitar? The management is unorganized or didn't care...I couldn't tell. They made us go to any department in the store if people needed help and sell whatever it was. I hated that because I was hired to be a musical instrument specialist. What do I know about dishwashers? Also it just seem immoral to have someone selling something they know nothing about. I guess the most enjoyable part of the job is talking about my passion, music, with a customer that needs advice or a studio put together."
bad,During my interview it seemed like a lot would be expected of me. Turns out they have a very hands off style of management. Young staff operates unprofessionally and in unchecked by management.
bad,"The focus has shifted from an employee friendly, service driven experience to a cash grab with constant increases in sales acquisition. I enjoyed my time there for over 5yrs, but the company begins to demand more and more with each quarter as expectations increase and reality to achieve decreases. I would only recommend getting a position in there field work if you like myself have ample experience in the field and can manage yourself."
bad,The people you work with are by and large very good but the fact you work in a retail setting with the public makes it a very hard job. The compensation for work is a little sub par but its not the worst place to have a starter job.
bad,"Management doesn't pay you for OT but expect ya too work off the shift, in order to move up it's all about who you know and raises are minimal because it effects the P&L."
bad,It is a good job to start with and a good job with flexible scheduling. Management was almost always willing to help me get shifts covers when needed or change some schedules since I’m in school and some things change last minute.  Not very good management and poor care for their employees.
bad,"No upward mobility.Up to 10% breakage during unloads. The "
bad,"Regular sales and customer service, Management sucks and barely does anything except for pal around and hang out on the floor and throws customers to sales associates."
bad,The management at my store was very lackadaisical. Things would be put off for the day and be put onto people coming to work later in the day. Overall there was not a huge amount of advancement opportunity.
bad,"Company has a culture that is not followed unless market leaders are present, promotion is earned by sucking up. The politics are awful. The thing that got me threw where some of the great young talent i came across"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,They worked with me around my college schedule and were very flexible. I could work more hours if I wanted beyond my part time hours and the employee discount was a good perk.
bad,"At best buy you were treated fairly but not the best company to work for, had to get your work done in time but sometimes never enough time or people to get it finished especially when you had other responsibilities."
bad,"Shifts were decent length, but varied too much between early and late. It was a good place to get experience in a corporate receiving and inventory setting. The management was nice, but was very stringent on company policies. I liked being able to complete tasks somewhat in what order I wanted."
bad,"democrats..republicans"
bad,"A lot of Nepotism, Managers Very protective of people they hired and very hard on people who were hired by other managers. A lot of misinformation regarding policies from people in authority."
bad,"A genuinely fun place to work as long as you dont take your job seriously, half the managers have no idea what they are doing, the others are too lazy to actually work, only expect to have 2 functional managers. The discounts are amazing but the job itself is repetitive. The other line level employees you work with are really cool since bestbuy tends to higher people in their 20s. But seriosuly dont make the mistake i made in trying too hard. this company WILL NOT compensate you for putting in 110%. Work at 60% and increase your work ethic only ever so slightly and you will receive praises for improving. Numbers dont matter, all that matters is whether or not the managers like you. There is a bonus structure, but good luck ever seeing a bonus since the odds are significantly stacked against you."
bad,"I been working for Best Buy since 2013 I start as a cashier , then move to a different position I worked at custimer service doing returns, exchange, placing order, later on 2015 I work at the phone answering phones calls placing order over the phones, shechudles appoiments for installions"
bad,Working here was fun for a while. I only work here for about six month so I would have time for college. They were good at working around my school schedule.
bad,"I am writing this review years after working there, so the culture may have changed significantly. While I was there, there was a constant push for up-sales and new sales. While I do not turn my nose up at sales positions, this is not what I intended to do there. In addition to this, like most retail environments, there is very little room for actual advancement. "
bad,its an okay job to work at but unrealistic goals. they only care about product sales which is understandable but if you sell a service your service needs to be just as good.
bad,I did not know much of anything when I started but you get to learn about all the technology and usually keeps up with new technology that is coming out so it is always fun to look at and play with. People usually wanted to have fun and is always about technology.
bad,was a alright place to work for part time.  the co workers were for the most part fun and enjoyable.  the way they track your numbers is a little weird as they expect you to hit certain numbers but workers from other sections that have lower goals will always come by and take sales away from you just to pad their numbers.  the moto of the company is team work but there is no team work with the way they have the whole process set up.
bad,When you come to work you check in with your manager or supervisor. Your supervisor or manager goes over your goals for the day. On a typical day at best buy particularly on a weekday its real slow. On  a weekday managers will bother you to help customers even though there are no customers to help or want to buy. Management is really pushy and always hovering over employees. The only great thing about best buy is the co workers.
bad,"Management would be the biggest factor on choosing to work for Best Buy. Poor Management seems to be growing rampantly and the company seems to be loosing its grip on the electronic retail  monopoly it once had. I have had amazing days working and having fun while being at Best Buy but the culture have changed. The advancement opportunities are more based on a political agenda instead of equal opportunity. The employees who I have worked with have been fantastic and I have made life long friends from these jobs. But this job has been the most stressful job on my resumé not due to the duties on a day to day but more on ethical and moral conflicts of ""business tactics"" with the management and corporate level and the lack of involvement or desire to fix and manage issues within management."
bad,"Depends on management, can be a great job. Worked in two different locations, completely different jobs. Often has a revolving door of employees leaving and hiring new ones who don't really know what they are doing. Benefits are great."
bad,I worked here for a little while the environment was cool and the people but management was terrible. A lot of favoritism and one thing they don't tell you is if you don't meet the monthly sales goals you can be fired after 3 failed attempts.
bad,"This job is for a college student living at home with their parents, not someone who has a mortgage to pay. The management is horrid and the hours are a joke."
bad,"Best Buy is a really fun place to work at if you work with friends and people that actually know what they are doing and are truthful. While I worked at Best Buy, that's the situation I was in. The manager was just terrible. Best Buy as a whole anywhere though, pretty much sucks. No employees know anything."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"The work load was too much, and pay was too low and most employees are with independent contractors and it was really hard to be hired on and my position was phased out without warning."
bad,"Working for Best Buy is incredible at first. The impressive discount (and other benefits) and friendly co-workers are great but, they are ALL that is good about Best Buy. Just about everything Best Buy does is a scam, whether it's an employee interaction or customer interaction there is something being miscommunicated. Best Buy DOES NOT care about it's employees, only how much they make the company an hour. We work on Thanksgiving just so they can sneak in a 10% Black Friday sale increase, while the !@#-holes up in corporate enjoy the holiday with their families. Between randomly being scheduled outside availability to random overnights and staggered shifts, the work schedule is hardly tolerable. Best Buy will not survive as a company if they decide that lying to and disrespecting employees and customers the way that they do."
bad,"if you don't have bills to pay and a family to feed, this job is for you. job security doesn't exist unless your a manager. This company is a joke. Don't bother if your an adult."
bad,"Very challenging place to work and very helpful in the tech field"
bad,wasn't bad. management will teach you things . but they feel like they are better than you simply because they are one step above you. they want all of our time not just what your scheduled for
bad,"I learned a lot from Geeksquad. I thought since I had my A+ I knew a lot of things. I was wrong, very wrong. Geeksquad taught me a lot about windows, mac, various ways to clean up viruses and every day was a new challenge. The myriad ways people can mess up a computer is absolutely fascinating, yet terrifying at the same time."
bad,"The culture at geek squad is great, if you don't work at Mission Valley."
bad,"It was a very high school drama style workplace.  Managers clearly had favorites and would overly express that by having very short fuses with the employees they didn't appreciate and would be quick to yell at them over a simple error, while giving other employees tickets to ranger games and other rewards they got from promoters."
bad,Your peers become your family but the company doesn't care much for your family or personal life. When you call out sick they don't even accept doctors note.
bad,"If you know your technology, it can be a fun job to work."
bad,"enjoyable when its busy. keeps everything going and keeps employees pumped. enjoyable staff, they're also easy to work with."
bad,"Your day will be filled with management expecting lots of you, even if everything is completed. Management plays favorites, and will take and take until you are left with nothing. Bonus structure needs MUCH improvement while the pay could use an overhaul as well. Employees are not treated equally and you WILL be passed up for positions you are well qualified for. You will be promised increases in pay - only to be paid less than others, and expected to perform much higher than those paid better around you."
bad,A typical day at work consist of helping customers meet their needs.
bad,They expect the world out of you but offer no commission or rigid schedule.  One week you'll have 25 hours and the next week you'll have 3.
bad,"Typically a day will consist of Opening the department, Printing the required Paper work (worksheets and zone sheets), Contacting every customer Every time. Providing excellent customer service, Able to provide Technical Support Services to our customers. Troubleshoot or Provide Light to Heavy repairs on Clients Devices (Desktops, Tablets, Laptops & All in One's) "
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of getting checked by your supervisor which brought you up to speed on individual and company performance and sales. Then from there it was on to selling. I learned a lot about various products and selling skills through the provided training but I would say most of my research and learning came from doing work outside of Best Buy or off the clock. My management team in general was awful with the exception of 2 supervisors (both not in my department). They gave no inspiration or actual management, they are consistently cramming the same thing down your throat day in and out and pushing more and more responsibility on you until you either snapped or quit. The only real help that came from them was in the form of register overrides and troubleshooting POS/customer issues. There is little to no advancement in the store I work in. From what I've heard, the only way to advance in the company is to change stores. Ive worked there for about 2 years and the only advancement was moving from part time to full time. My co-workers were great, I enjoyed meeting all of them as well as spending the majority of the day with them. Theyre all pretty chill, low drama. The hardest part about my job is the consistent level of rising responsibility without compensation. Managers and supervisors consistently pilled on more and more responsibility on you with very little to no incentive or compensation. If you let them, they would walk all over you. Managers play favorites so if you are looking for a job here get on their good side. Another thing my managers liked to"
bad,"You are paid way less, and compensated way less for the amount of knowledge you need, experience, and hard work you have to put in, to be successfull at that job. No benefits for part timers, and getting full-time is difficult."
bad,Enjoyed working there. I liked the pay for retail and the hours were good. The environment was fun. 
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I have worked for this company for a little over a year now. The longer I work there, the more I realize what a terrible company BestBuy is to work for. A typical work day consists of answering the telephone and selling product over the phone to customers, as well as placing orders for customers online. I process the paperwork for the customers who come into the store to pick up their purchases and offer additional merchandise to ""complete"" their purchase. I have learned multi-tasking skills from this position as I am required to do many things all at once. Management does the best they can to avoid manager issues, such as speaking with angry customers who request a member of the management team. Little or no effort is put forth to teach the necessary skills to employees when asked to accomplish a new task that the employee has never been trained to do. My co-workers are all exceptional. They are always willing to help when they can, and I enjoy work due to the interactions that I have with them. The hardest part of the job is teaching myself how to do things that I have never done. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers who are in need of my help and interacting with my co-workers throughout the day."
bad,Ok place to work if you are a sales associate. Managment has a horrible work/life balance. District staff is supportive.
bad,"Right now I work on the sales floor, so a typical day is interactig with all customers to ensure no customer goes unserved. I deal with any customer issues and try to match customers up with the appropriate products. I have learned customer service and how to speak professionaly with customers. i do not agree with our management, it is usually who you know that gets you promoted, so I do not think the staff we currently have is the best candidates for the positions. I enjoy my co-workers, we like to have fun while still making sure we contact every customer every time. We do not make comission, so it makes the job more fun with less pressure to just sell something,instead I can build a relationship with the customer to give them a great experience so even if they do not buy that day, they will remember their experience which will bring them back when they are ready to purchase. I enjoy speaking with customers,helping them and answering questions. It lights them up when I can teach them about product which excites them to purchas knowing they understand the product and I am just noy trying to sell them something."
bad,Great company to work for but the job security is not there and the pay is not fair and also the number hours of work is not good for home life to take care family.
bad,I enjoy meeting new people. Able to meet my daily goals given to me by management.
bad,Good job security but not enough pay for what's expected of the employess at work who are pressured to sell yet do not make commission while their bosses do.
bad,"Working at 5 different locations around the US, I can say with utter certainty that management gets a free license to treat their employees however they want. Usually, it ends up with managers who are money hungry in sales and eager to keep numbers pretty so they can move up the corporate ladder. Rarely did I ever encounter anyone who cared enough about me as a person to progress my individual growth separated from the company. I will say, as a first job it is good, and will teach introductory business and a lot of technology skills, but I would recommend staying for a year or two and advancing further into another field or using it to balance school life."
bad,"A typical day would consist of helping customers find the right solution but depending on your higher ups in the store, it can be more about selling than supporting."
bad,"This could just be the experience I had but the bestbuy I worked at felt more like we were on commission then salery. Not only that but on multiple occasions a few members of management would pressure you into getting some services for the ""customer"" I will say that if you get to know the employees at bestbuy in most cases there extremely nice and friendly. But management would be the down fall of some bestbuys."
bad,"My managers and team members in the mobile department while I was there made the work experience. They did not pay a living wage for the duration of the time that I worked there, and a $1 raise after a year was seen as a huge deal even when you hit or exceed any sales goals."
bad,very poor management. even though were not a commission based company and is supposed to be about customer service. They make it a very hard and stressful environment to be in
bad,great place. nice environment. workplace culture is relaxed and coworkers were very nice. if youre looking for work as a student it is highly recommened you apply there
bad,"Great job but poor management. They do not inform there employees of termination. Was hired as a seasonal employee did a great job, after season was over didn't get hours then proceeded to get locked out of the schedule. Got let go with no notification."
bad,"There were plenty of enjoyable times at Best Buy, but the company had a tendency to blame its falling sales on employees themselves and not on the changing market."
bad,By seasonal employment they mean come in on Black Friday and struggle to figure out what you're supposed to do while hordes of people flood into the store.
bad,"Change of schedule on last minute, got less hours, every week, I wanted hours. You work until 11pm or later. Lots of product quizzes, were easy. Discount were great."
bad,"nothing meets guidlines on indeed, so i decided to write something completly different because there's no reason to NOT be able to skip this stuff. It's all gravy."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"I wish to work with the public was less stressful, and that management improved. Having to reach a credit card quota isn't fun, especially when you're a hard worker. Not reaching the credit card goal made staff have to attend a mandatory meeting. "
bad,i was only there for seasonal but they hired way too many people so no one hardly got any hours. there was 2 weeks where i didnt get any hours at all.
bad,"Estuve en el departamento Mobile como asesor de Ventas y puedo decir que la empresa invierte muchos recursos en sus empleados como capacitaciones pagadas y prestaciones superiores a los de Ley, pero no otorgan comisiones a los vendedores, me prometieron un ambiente laboral muy bueno y terminó siendo pésimo por problemas con varios compañeros y con la Gerencia. Los sueldos son bajos comparados a otras tiendas retail."
bad,Management created a toxic work environment where gosip and hear say are taken a gospel.  I loved the job itself and the customers I helped over the two and a half years I work at the store.  I gave my best and it was ruined by a few.  Apply at your own risk.
bad,"They were about an average work place, though I had to deal with a management team that were friends first, so when I had an issue I had no-one in the store to go to, it ended up costing me my job. I loved my job it was just sad that because of pettyness I lost it."
bad,I worked for Best Buy my senior year of High School and it was very stressful especially during the holiday season. Long hours and poor training made this a very unpleasant experience.
bad,"The company as a whole while there was in a state of complete overhaul from traditional box store to a more blended format between store employees and vendor occupied store. The employees I worked with were great and fun to be around. Upper management was horrendous and impossible to work with. They rarely let their employees do their thing without trying to micromanage and put their two cents in every step of the way. The store manager was often never around and relied heavily on her assistants that were not properly trained for their positions. Pushed a sales mentality yet didn't follow that format in the store. Overall their model was more based around a traditional commission based job and drove numbers and sales as a determining factor of job performance yet the pay was per hour regardless of whether you ""hit your numbers"" or were below them. Paid minimum wage yet expected above wage work. Never told positive things to you but were quick to point out all the negatives. Were very conservative in their hiring practices that there was never enough floor coverage and typically had to work your position but 3-4 other departments. If you got held up in a different department you were covering and not in your assigned one you would be reprimanded for failure to maintain your department's costumers and merchandise. IF it wasn't for the great floor workers I had with me this company would have gotten a solid 1 star."
bad,"It's a good job if you need a job, but don't expect to work there forever. Some stores are terrible to work at and others were better. It depends on what they're like near you."
bad,"Great managers but working in retail is its own beast. I was given many opportunities and enjoyed the work I did, but was not pleased with some decision made by corporate."
bad,Get it together leadership were not numbers. Maybe if I wasnt cleaning everday cause traffic is slow and favoritism...I really dont care about that place anymore. Get it together best buy
bad,"Most of the management was rude on occasion and wouldn't be honest or helpful. I highly enjoyed selling the products I sold, and feel like I did a good job during my time there. But in my attempts to continue employment, I've just been left clueless. Not sure why I cant get a straight answer."
bad,"This job is one I held for one christmas season over a decade ago, so I don't think anything I can say about the current company matters a whole lot here."
bad,"Management sucks at communication.. I loved until i realized management only looks out for themselves before starting there i signed up for 2nd shift but management ask me to do 1st since they neeses me more..well, i told them i couldent because the 1st shift peak hours wouldn't work with my schedule (which is why i chose 2nd) but they said ok just work 6 to 3 instead of 8-6 so i did and for a while it was great until it got to the point where i couldent even make in to work because my kids and everything esle reminded that i should have said no to them no matter how ""pressing"" it seemed when he asked me"
bad,"a work day was typically very busy, i learned a lot about trouble shooting and colleagues were always there to help me out with issues i didn't understand"
bad,Best Buy is notorious for having poor management. They will not properly train you to do your job and then get angry when you don't know how to do it. You're expected to do everything correctly by day one. They also do not adhere to availability even though they have it right in front of them when they make the schedule.
bad,"If you go in expecting to help customers with their electronic problems, you will be sorely disappointed.  Best Buy's sole goal is to get as much money out of a customer as possible and the leads pressure you into getting minimum quota sales and card apps."
bad,Provided customer service support to clients who were receiving appliance deliveries and/or installations. Handled escalations that arose from install
bad,Worked while I was still in school and management always scheduled me when I could not work. I gave them times and days I could work and they never followed it.
bad,Management had hard time to motivate employees to keep them on track. Poor scheduling lead to dissatisfied employees who were eager to work during the busy holiday season.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Workin at bestbuy was fun and the people were nice and we all worked together and made a great team. We all had our ups and downs with the systems at Best Buy but we always did our best
bad,"Corporate Leadership is terrible.  They are completely disconnected from the employees.  There were glaring problems that were created by higher-ups that they refused to address or even acknowledge.  Ultimately, you end up micromanaged by someone whom has never set foot in a retail store and has no idea what is needed to do your job.  At the store level, work was fine, but overall, this company is frustrating to work for."
bad,Sales job that taught a lot about customer interaction and being a helping hand to those that enter the store. Had a good time working there but ultimately never planned to stay long.
bad,This job was a steping stone for me before I started at my current place of work. The flexible schedule and team dynamic are the most memorable characteristics about this job.
bad,"Very unorganized and cut-throat.  In order to take advantage of opportunities, you have to have a personal relationship with people of a higher position."
bad,"The management switched completely out about 3 times in the 16 months I worked there. I loved my coworkers, but it was annoying to have to relearn a new boss every couple months."
bad,Best buy shifted from being a retailer that could educate customers on the types of products and technologies they sold in their stores to a glorified showroom.  Their lack in pay lead to an exodus in talent which can be reflected in the consumer experience today.
bad,"bla bla bla i helped stupid people with their broken electronics, they didnt care about the change in wages going around and basically kept full time people at part time hours"
bad,Working at Best Buy was decent nothing special. Normal customer service job . I wouldn’t want to work there again but it was a great stepping stone for a college kid.
bad,"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this for others, but I prefer to maintain my privacy and professionalism by not discussing this even anonymously."
bad,"BestBuy is a decent place to work if you just need a part time and a good discount. How ever it is not a great place to seek a career or full time job its not a positive place, pay is unfair, and management is horrible."
bad,Its retail at its finest. flexible but not for those seeking advancement in life. They do not value the staff members like they should and it will lock you down as far as pursuing other avenues like managing multiple jobs
bad,"Working at best buy wasn't the best job in the world but it definitely was a decent place to be while in school or something. Management wasn't the best (depending on where you are at) but that somewhat everywhere. The biggest issue is management would always give broken promises. Pay is as any other retail job, about $9-10 a hour depending on the department or area of work. Co workers were very competitive and didn't feel like a team environment, felt more of competition every time you walked into work. The employee discount was probably the best thing about best buy."
bad,"My position called for a lot of standing around, waiting for customers to make it my small section of the store. There was also a lack of career advancement due to management."
bad,"Best Buy Gulf Coast Town Center- Lead asset protection associate  "
bad,retail is tough especially during the holidays but  that experience I was able to gain made it worth it. Best Buy constantly changes so if you don’t like change don’t work here
bad,Not really a fun place to work. Managment sometimes tries to be everyone's friend so that they can sit back and watch everyone else do the work. It's hard to grow here.
bad,"I learned more about the world and about humans as a whole at this job than I ever would have wanted to. I gained invaluable time-management skills, stress management coping mechanisms, and became intimately familiar with client services."
bad,"There was very little team work working for best buy. When it gets busy it gets so crazy at times i've seen an employee get so frustrated he just walked out. They Cut the CA (customer assistant) program which I started under which was a horrible mistake on their part. Customers had a hard enough time finding a salesman, why provide less assistance? Bad coordination between Boss, Managers, and crew."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,Dont work here. Overworked and underpaid. I was working 40 hour weeks with part time benefits. The employee discount is laughable.. just go to amazon if you want the employee discount
bad,"Best Buy is a decent company, I feel they could do more hands on training. Security is not allowed to apprehend so it defeats the purpose if there are boosters in the store."
bad,"good place to start but be prepaired to sell no mater what position you get, i delivery appiances and even i have a $500 quota to meet every month and im supposed to do it in there houses. and inorder to get full time with benifits you have to do some major bum kissing"
bad,It's a okay place to work depending on witch store you end up in. Some have horrible customer service while others hire people who have no idea about the products they are trying to sell.
bad,this place is an okay starter job but I would not consider it as a place to build a career.Not much advancement opportunity & pay is well not worth the work they are asking.
bad,"Limited opportunity for growth and very low salary.  No incentives to stay with the company,  I make less after 25 years than those who are just starting with an organization,"
bad,"The job was fun for a little while, but ultimately the compensation is lackluster. It leaves a lot to be desired. Room for advancement is also minimal at best."
bad,"Was no room for career advancement, poor pay, and lousy management. i am only writing this because indeed.com is forcing me to do it in order to upload a resume"
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and variety of product, but I didn't enjoy the culture of the store and their customer policies and how they handled customer service."
bad,theres never enough staff so it is pretty difficult to get lunches not many coworkers want to help each other out when it is needed. some managers are not knowledgeable on the product as they should be
bad,"company is a time bomb waiting to go off, they act like it has recovered but when you see maybe 20 customers come in from 10am-2pm its not a company that will last."
bad,"I was new to the area and was hired with in a week of applying. They have an extensive training program that was very thorough. There is an extended management staff for each department of the store which made it easier to get information for customers. As a cashier, I spent my time running register and training my peers. The hardest part of the job is trying to reach daily sales goals with credit cards and magazines subscriptions."
bad,it's a paycheck. The management has no cares about their employees or their welfare. You can only thank them for allowing you to get a paycheck.
bad,"You must ask off 21 days in advance, even though schedules aren't posted until about 7 days before. Management was not the greatest. They claim to be ""leaders"", but a more accurate term for them is managers. My supervisor once screamed (at the top of his lungs) profanity and derogatory terms at me from the back of the store. The customer actually heard it and commented on it later in the sale. The same manager talked about other people behind their back and, at times, made very racist and physically suggestive remarks about a number of other workers. The work is redundant. If you are not with a customer at all times, you're likely to be called out over the earpiece for all the workers to hear. There were positions to move up the ladder within the store, but I never applied due to the fact that this was a second job for me, not a career. Customers can get very cranky at times. The job environment causes some of the worst turnover rates of corporate companies. "
bad,"Minimum wage for monkey labor.  It's not a great job, but if you're a high schooler looking to get some cash...go for it.  Just make sure you select a good store by asking the employees if they like their job first."
bad,"-only a seasonal employee"
bad,I worked as inventory specialist unload product and bring it to shelves.  The problem with the job was that it didn't matter how good you do your job because you can not leave until everybody is done.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Hired for seasonal, It was okay but the bosses pressure you too much to do things you are not comfortable with. Should have commission cause the techniques you need to use to sell deserve some sort of pay."
bad,"Training consists of hours behind a computer reading and taking tests and then you are thrown to the wolves with no hands on training. Management is lazy and expects you to know what to do and gets frustrated when it has to be explained. The overall feeling of appreciation is not there and management generally does not care if you are sick, your kids are sick, or even if your doctor advised to not to go to work. They are only about the numbers and money."
bad,I enjoyed working there. I really liked all my coworkers management was great. the only real problem was there was no room for advancement.
bad,great place if your into kids and a good and fair work environment. Everyone is friendly and there isn't a bunch of nonsense its like one happy family
bad,Local store had very bad habit of assuming every time someone was calling in sick it was to go to the bar.  Required you to come in even if you were sick unless you found someone to cover you.  Managers had no respect for employees.
bad,My store in particular was a fun environment for a high school student. The hours were great and my co-workers made it enjoyable.
bad,Call centers concentrated more on time constraints than taking care of their customers needs because management's bonuses were based on number of calls and minimal call times.
bad,This job is good for college students. Best Buy was very flexible with my class schedule when I was in college. I was even offered tuition assistance for working full time while taking classes.
bad,"The job security is lacking and the management will never have their employee's back on any decision that is made. They will say one thing to your face but go behind your back and betray you as an employee. I loved what I did, but I will never work for a company who treats customers and their staff and badly as they do again."
bad,need more money for the amout of things we take on for managers we just need more money my son makes almost 30 cent less than me and I have been there for 3 years its crazy!!!!
bad,"They hired me away from the job i had had prior for nearly five years under the pretense of better pay and continuous work. And although yes the pay was better in the end i was let go because ""there just isn't enough money and room to keep  you hired. sorry."""
bad,"best buy is good about taking care of its patrons from a sales standpoint, but instead of paying its employees what they are actually worth they pay them the lowest possible. i fully blame store management teams for not  truly being able to identify where its employees strengths and weaknesses lie. it is a good place to get your feet wet for how corporate entities work, but they ask way to much for how little they pay and refuse to shift people into the roles they really need to be in, they would rather put a band-aid on top of a gaping hole than suture the wound as a permanent fix and it causes a huge rift between the hourly staff and the salaried staff. and that rift relates to high turn over rates and underpaid new employees that really have no idea what they are doing. its a shame because they used to be great about training people to actually know what they were talking about, now its all smoke and mirrors."
bad,weak management caused working here an awful experience as a whole. it was really a shame. weak leadership that were unwilling to work together hurt any chance of bettering the store or team.
bad,Sales and installation all day. down time was expected to be used to do other things of management choice.  Sporadic hours and pay was not very good.
bad,"Worst Place I have ever worked it. I applied for one position and got absolutely STUCK in another. Hires everyone Part-Time so you don't get any real benefits, and they get rid of all the older , experience better working employees ."
bad,Enjoyed what I did at best buy. Work environment was good. Management could have been better. Lines of communication could have been better.
bad,"i had  a lot of fun working there, but little promotional achievements. the health care packages and tuition assistance programs sucked."
bad,"Fun workplace, management is well organized, the only thing about working at best buy is the hours and pay."
bad,not much to tell. Not a bad place for a start-up job. Opportunities to work with different people. Best thing is working with new electronics stuff.
bad,extreme sales goals with constant restructuring. demands are very high.
bad,Though a lot has changed since I was there you won't succeed unless you conform. They wouldn't let you talk to customers and a manner that was comfortable to you. Instead they had more or less a script that made you feel very uncomfortable both as a sales associate and for the customers themselves. The management when I was there would do anything but tell you the truth and be upfront and honest about everything.
bad,"count till, put till in register, help customers, end of shift, count till again."
bad,"If you're a young night owl, this job is for you.  Don't expect competitive pay or much chance for advancement."
bad,"Felt like I was sitting around, I like to be more hands on. Not much work"
bad,"In the computer department, a lot of what I did was administrative and sales. This department is very goal orientated. I give the team their goals and we make these goals. My team was great because we all had goals to achieve. Teamwork was the strong with this group and helped when we had tough customers."
bad,started out great but progressively got worst because of management.
bad,"Easy work, must be people friendly. Learned how to deal with many types of people. Loved my time at best buy."
bad,"This is your typical retail store. The only good thing is the pay, was decent, but almost impossible to move up"
bad,"I loved working for best buy and it was a great way to get my foot in the door. The management there was not the best,"
bad,"A typical day at work is dealing with customer issues.  Customers come in with a different problem every time.  Knowing how to troubleshoot is key when working in Geek Squad.  Management needs a lot of work, they're communication skills are very poor.  Hardest part of the job is getting any sort of information from managers."
bad,"1st job where I learned process ALL check, credit card and cash transactions at cash register. Frustrating at times because not time to setting up all displays usually due to customer service duties."
bad,"Extremely chaotic environment, not very well managed. Many times did not get breaks and wasn't allotted time to eat. Grossly understaffed and the staff they did hire was not very knowledgeable about the products available for sale"
bad,"Our management needs to go through a management class. The management cannot manage people acutely we are always are low staffed because we gave some associates, the same associates the day off because they were sick, on a beautiful day, near the beach, on a Friday, pure coincidence I`m sure even though they come in to work the next day sunburned. We have a rule of you are 7 minutes late you are still on time. I do not agree with that early is on time, on time is late."
bad,"working for this company and being laid off after five years of service and being told ""that i can apply for another job left a bitter taste in my mouth"
bad,"Retail is a good place to work at because of customers. What really drags and stresses me out in Best Buy is the pay. Management is alright. I am getting UNDERPAID for the stress that I go through to help Best Buy achieve their money. I am a full-timer and am treated like a part-timer. I can't get my own place because I do not make enough money. The only thing I can afford is food in my mouth and my car. Also, I only get approximately 32 hours a week when a full timer with benefits should receive 40 hours."
bad,a lot of people worked there. a typical call center environment. a lot of hours.
bad,"Busy, fast paced environment, continuous learning"
bad,Best Buy offers a steep discount on otherwise pretty expensive products
bad,learned that it is a vary place where they like to sell to people by there class will treat people different if they feel they are high class or low class.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"BETTER MANAGEMENT!!!"
bad,"The company, by all accounts, is not doing well. There was(in my experience) more focus on the bottom line than company culture and customer care."
bad,very interesting experience working In the retail industry
bad,"I work on planograms, merchandising, auditing prices and correctly pricing merchandise. I also locate and retrieve product that has been ordered online."
bad,"fun place to work for, stick to your sales expectations and make sure you have knowledge of everything your going to be selling, also you have to be very versatile with the different breeds of people that come into the store and how you go about your conversations with said people. always interesting"
bad,"My everyday routine was the same and never changes unless i was selling a different product. it was a OK experience. "
bad,good job for employee just starting out in the sales field fun workplace especially if you enjoy interacting with the public
bad,I had a horrible time working here. I got taken advantage of and the managers where verbally threatening.
bad,"lack of professionalism from some employees, but payed  very well"
bad,"A excellent company to work for, co workers are great to work with funny to be around"
bad,"was enjoyable to work there. there was always a surprise at work. i made a few life long friends at work. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable part was that work was not like work, we had fun at all times."
bad,Hard to advance. Depends on who you know in the company. Many coworkers complained the advancement and increase in pay was not worth the amount of work the higher up your position is.
bad,"Good place to work, be very careful on what your doing. They expect you to know everything and make exceptions that can cost you your job. Always take a partner and try to have some fun. It's very number focused. If your not performing you will not like Best Buy. Its a sales job no matter what position your in."
bad,"A typical day at work included, but was no limited to: updating clients about the status of our work on their computers, updating all system information pertaining to the client, tracking and shipping outbound/inbound repairs, answering phone calls and filing paperwork."
bad,The work could be made much easier and more satisfying by different corporate and store standards. The pay is also low.
bad,"store support great, muddied and unidentifiable leadership from corporate staff"
bad,They would not give me enough hours and kept taking hours from me
bad,"A typical day at Best Buy is assisting customers when needed, stocking shelves, setting up planograms, making signs and overall cleaning of the department. I have gained much knowledge in regard to technology. The management is something to be desired. They only time they ever talk to you is to either yell or ask you to stay late. My co-workers are mostly young high school kids just looking to make a few extra bucks. The most difficult part of my job is trying to please the customers and appease to their every needs and then having the managers and supervisors tell you that you cant make those kinds of acceptions, but then in the same breath remind you that good customer service is everything... They are two faced liars that have absolutely no idea what they're talking about."
bad,"I loved it there. they had everything, nice people, good environment, everything there was amazing,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"Typical day at corporate was very easy. They would give me tasks and I would complete them on my own. I learned a lot of tricks of B2B sales and the difference between consumer sales and business sales. Management was one of my biggest problems. There was little to know communication from them. If you did something they didn't like they wouldn't tell you right away to change the behavior, they would wait for your monthly 1 on 1 and then not even tell you how to correct it. The hardest part of the job was the security. With best buy not doing well financially you never felt like your job was safe, in the end my job was not safe as I was laid off. The most enjoyable part was definitely the sales."
bad,"It's a standard corporate retail. Lower pay, power hungry management and treated as a low level worker."
bad,"I have served in many different roles at Best Buy, but I am seeking to advance my career where I can advance my career gaining additional skills and knowledge. Best Buy does not provide many opportunities for advancement within the company."
bad,Very little job security. Was let go with no warning after 1.5 years of employment
bad,I worked for best for 3 years and was not given the opportunity to move up in the company once. i was number 1 in sales in my department most months but quit still being paid less than $10/hour.
bad,The store location had no customer it was very low pace working enviroment
bad,"Working at Best Buy was not a great experience. The management was poor, our products were always returned with dissatisfied customers, and the employees did nothing but talk about how drunk they were the night before or at a party."
bad,"At Best Buy, the loss prevention department was more customer service than actual security or catching shoplifters. The LP personel were posted at the front door and served as greeters and customer service people."
bad,"This environment was great while I was working for one department. We continuously won regional awards for sales and installations, but new management decided to require employees work in different departments other than what they were trained in. This made the job difficult and miserable for myself and others."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of helping customers in anyway needed. I learned about appliances and customer service along with money handling skills.
bad,"While working at Best Buy, I learned a lot about being a manager and leading a team to reach a goal. A typical day would be returning emails, one on one coaching sessions with each employee and together figure out the strong points and areas of opportunities. I would let them know where the department stood month to date and different goals that needed a little bit more attention. The leadership team at my store could have been a tad bit strong if there was more open communication between them. I would have to say the hardest part of my job would be interviews. Sometimes you have so many good candidates and can only pick one. I believe in giving everyone a chance, but sometimes you just can't. What I love about my job is the coaching and training I get to do. I love my team and I have watched several of them grow into amazing sales associates."
bad,if your looking for a good place to learn sales and technology best buy is the place for you
bad,For the most part Best Buy was a decent place to work. They had a lack of organization and poor scheduling.
bad,it was an ok place to work. the job was easy but the managment was not great and ppl would argue and complain all the time i dont really know why. lots of benefits though
bad,"Knew what you were doing but constantly had to wait for things to be handled. Such as for managers to take care of situations that was arising.  As well as, favoritism and pointless altercations when they didn't like things."
bad,why do i need to write a review and it has to be 150 minimum characters. It was great while it lasted. I still have 30 more characters to write. each store is different
bad,just like any company you get back what you put into the company. its a good company with room to grow as long as you make it known to the management with your intentions.
bad,"fun place to work if you are in high school, easy schedule will work with your college schedule. enjoyed meeting people there and management is great as well"
bad,I really liked the job when I started. The benefits were good even the management at the time was good but 3 years later the management changed. The hours changed and the work value dropped exponentially. I love the benefits the but the management really needs so work. Not the worst place to work but far from good.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,"This was my start down the technology path. I was placed in the computer department, and later made my way to Geek Squad. I met a lot of friends who I am still close with today."
bad,"Best buy is a great place to learn about technology, all your fellow workers are amazing. Management is horrible, will force you to oversell. Store managers hire their peers as department manager and employees have to end up teaching the manager about departmental tasks. Certain managers force you to over-sell. Discount is amazing."
bad,"It is alright, it is nothing extraordinary just another job. It has good people and good environment, however I cannot stand the issue surrounding hours."
bad,"This can be a fun and engaging place to work, until they find a sliver in profit in ending that.  Decisions are made at high levels that seem to contradict plans that were already in place with no prior indication."
bad,"From the upper management down to the blueshirts and receiving staff, Best Buy seeks to create a culture of belonging. With this in mind, they do an excellent job, which is only helped along due to the fact that the company no longer works on commission. However, there are some pretty glaring issues, mostly in the area of work-life balance. Given the type of industry Best Buy is a part of, sales are highly erratic, and lacking in mornings. At MOST locations, part-time spots will be filled with college students, which means that full-time employees and those with open availability often get saddled with the bulk of the morning shifts. During the morning, sales are extremely slow, which reflects poorly on full-time employees, and the company does not seem to understand the importance of accounting for this discrepancy. In a time when hitting increasing productivity targets is becoming much more critical, those who value their standing within the company are feeling a lot of pressure right now. "
bad,"Best Buy offers good culture, but lacks competitive salary. Its a good safe place to start, but a the BEST place to move towards a better company when you are ready."
bad,"BestBuy in all is a awesome work place. The structure of the company, it's values and training is on point. "
bad,"When I first started to work at Best Buy I though it was amazing. I would start off my day by looking at the computer that had repairs done and would just make sure all the paper work and the computers would match up. Management started off great, they focused on making sure the customer was happy because if we took care of them they would want to spend money with our company. Over time that changed and  it was more of a if you don't purchase anything from us we wont help you. I enjoyed all the troubleshooting skills I picked up as well as learning how to explain a computer issue with someone who wasn't too knowledgeable on computers or just technology in general. The hardest part for me was how to trouble shoot android phones. At this time I wasn't too knowledgeable on this platform but since we did the insurance claims I learned a lot about how different Android was to iOS and Windows phone. I enjoyed all the hands on experience that I got while working here, from trouble shooting computers, cellphones, installing programs, changing the languages on the computer to peoples native language. I did learn a lot here and many of the skill that I honed here I still use to this very day at work or when helping friends and family with technical issues."
bad,"service lent, superviseur avec manque d'experience et manque de comprehension"
bad,"Experienced project leader excellent written and verbal communicator Adaptability Critical thinker. Decision maker, problem solver Exceptional customer service skills. Customer service expert with sound judgment and the ability to resolve problems tactfully and diplomatically"
bad,As an employee the best part about working for this organization are the perks. 
bad,Best Buy accidentally hired me as an extra to the crew for the holiday season so their communication and willingness to give me hours was low but other than that its a great place to work.  If they would have told me upfront or at least apologized on their behalf it'd be different but nonetheless a good company!
bad,"When I first got the job I was exited and enjoyed coming into work everyday ! After about 5 months our manager got transferred so a different location. Due to the changes we got new management and the company started to change , managers started to get rude with employees and just made it difficult to enjoy coming into work. Too much drama and favoritism in my department"
bad,"A typical day at work is easy, hardest part is being held back and not able to move up with the company because your leader refuses to promote you. I train employees so that I am able to have a day off and be able to come back to work stress free."
bad,You do not recieve commision as a sales associate but very sales driven. There are some opportunities for advancements. Work hard and sell alot and you can make it
bad,"I love the company, great benefits, great work life, bad management can make or break a job, and when unqualified people are put in a role of power without consequence it can make the job you have hard."
bad,Do not pay nearly enough to be able to afford basic benefits.  Great job for college kids.  Don't make this a primary (rest of your life) job.  Pros and Cons pretty much sum it all up.
bad,"Enjoy working for best buy/geeksquad as a whole, however current managemtn very much micromanages to a point that things cant get done because of this and the requests made during that."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
bad,I like working here there is a lot of employees that are respected in evert way everyone gets treated right the management team is also really good to everyone
bad,"I worked there for quite a while. And for the most part, it was a great place to work. How ever, they worked me 50 hours a week, which I did not mind. They would not advance me to full time even though I had been working these hours for quite a few months. It was super frustrating to work as a full time employee but not be a full time employee. I missed out on a lot of benefits because they would not give me full time status. This was very demoralizing as well. I did not like how management would encourage us to take full advantage of the customers. To push all of our products on them. This ended up frustrating the customers and as a result a loss of sale."
bad,I have been with the company for 5 years it has always been fun and all the new technology that comes through the store is amazing.
bad,all in all a good place to work. just did not ever get enough hours great people.
bad,"Merchandise sales, meeting new customers daily is something I enjoy, it has given me the ability to communicate with all nationalities. Thus creating complete confidence in my sales techniques."
bad,Best Buy a the time of my employment didn't appreciate the skills I had to offer and they were not willing to advance me in the job.
bad,This is a great company with great incentives to excel in the work place.
bad,"A great start. Not some where you want to end up, but a great place to begin one's carrier. There are certainly internal advancement opportunities there, but these opportunities are few and take many years to advance even a little bit."
bad,"I worked at Best Buy during the Holiday season with hopes of hoping to become a team member instead of seasonal. I would sell computer, cameras, iPod's, tablets.. you name it. Well it was all fun and games unit the ASM gave me a TWO day notice that I was being let go along with all the other seasonal. "
bad,"I worked at this location for 3 years. I worked warehouse and enjoyed the work. I liked always being busy, most management was great, and employees were great to work with. The company has great benefits and flexible schedules. They will work around school and other jobs. The warehouse manager is awful though. He is the reason why I and a handful of other women have left the store. Reports have been made and nothing was done. Disappointing."
bad,The company was very well ran! I worked there for 2 years and never was moved up even though my sales were through the roof! I was one of the best and never rewarded!
bad,"It's a good place to work. I have learned about technology, management, and customer service. However, they simply do not pay well."
bad,"Good place to work if you need pocket money. I picked up this job as a seasonal sales rep, so the big downsides would be irregular hours, lack of scheduled hours and low pay. A standard day would consist of approaching customers, answering product questions and demonstration of products when applicable. Co-workers are very helpful and friendly. Best part of the job was selling products I'm actually passionate about, didn't have to fake it one bit. My only real complaint is that I applied with a resume rich with Microsoft and general PC experience, and they placed me in the video games department. Kind of a waste of talent if you ask me."
bad,"Overall this job was amazing. The centralized hr system is terrible and their mistakes cost me the best job I've ever had. They took amazing care of me in my role. But when HR fails you, it ruins you on the entire organization."
bad,Fun company with a diverse group of individuals. The performance based bonuses are a great addition as well as the Path to Excellence incentives that reward you based on personal accolades.
bad,"Really o.k when your in co-op than possible chance ,I recently became a part time , but I`m still doing the same positions in co-op ( movies , down stocking , putting prices tags and pricing movies). Really I feel that the manager is really making an excuse for to fire me! but really I manage to do my best coping this part time and looking for new job part time job in future. Surly that the manager would be happy but really good discounts, dental benefits , like insurance. Even as student (full time and taking part time continue education in post secondary school). But maybe there might be possible that I might become a full part time product process position, or I might just find another before the manager take me out of the job."
good,"Meet a lot of great people and learned a lot of skills form my team, my supervisor was an awesome. Management is poor. Pay was very low. Understaffed."
good,"This is a real review. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy encourages self development opportunities for their employees. Self development opportunities are offered through computer learning software (also known as eLearning).
good,Best buy is one of those jobs that promises to be different and spends a great deal of time talking about that. If they spent half of the time developing culture as they do complaining about it they would be one of the best retail locations you could work for.
good,"There was no room for growth at this company, unless you somehow became best friends with leadership. I do not recommend this company to anyone at all."
good,packed up merchandise and shipped it out what i learned how to make boxes management was terrible work place culture was stressfull hardest part of job was being there enjoyable part of job was not being there
good,This place was difficult to work for because of nobody willing to work together. Nobody willing to help the front registers when it was busy there but nowhere else in the store many times customer complained about this as well.
good,Great store on the surface but it stops there. I work in the Geek Squad. You train yourself as problems arise. Knowing the computers is the easy part. The paperwork is the hard part. The systems they have in place do not make sense when it comes to efficiency. Management is so very weak. There are no leaders in management. Earned authority does not exist there. Good part time job if you can hold your nose and stay silent.
good,I would never work there again. for 7 years I work 7 a day and would get any kind of lunch because I didn't work at least 7 and a half hours. I hate at place. the staff would always talk about customers. I hated it there. I will never shop there.
good,Only good for a first job. Very little room for advancement for entry level employees. nothing else to say about best buy at this point
good,"A typical day at work was trying not to mess up and loss the job."
good,"Although provided employee all the tools we need, at the end job security is the main problem."
good,I really liked interacting with the customers and helping them finalize thier purchase. i loved playing with all the new electonics and being knowledgable on todays newest technology. i also loved my supervisor and my co workers well some of them.
good,The pay is not add up to the work. The management is more concerned with their own job security to care about anyone else's. Overall would not go back.
good,"I used to work at Future Shop, where I was fairly compensated for my job and was not micromanaged.  Best Buy is a whole different story.  The micromanagement is atrocious but you get paid minimum wage."
good,"My experience with this company was all around poor. There were no advancement options, very poor management and horrible training. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"My immediate supervisor is/was a person I worked for again after Best Buy. They were great. Upper management is similar to a pyramid scheme. ""Help me help you"" sort of stuff. They claim non-commission, but it absolutely existed in every single department. If you're working here after age 27, I would hope it's because you were bored of sitting at home in your retirement."
good,"- Typical Day at work"
good,You work 3 days out the week if you’re part time. They look down on you if you try to move up in the company. You constantly get stabbed in the back by management. Everybody has their favorite employee
good,"The company is very competitive with numbers and treats their employees like car salesmen. Unlike them, however, Best Buy is commission sales so it is all of the stress and none of the benefits."
good,Best Buy would be better if everyone was governed by the same rules and regulations. Too much focus on credit card apps and not teaching associates to sale and build relationships with the guest. The employee's that are able to work the best are undervalued and need to be appreciated more.  Talent is also not developed correctly and not enough management is moved up so the respect level is minimal.
good,"Customers are rude and management will not support employees, they believe customers are always right when they are not!!! support the employees, not always customers!!!!!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Apparently it varies store to store but the 3 I worked at were all terrible with management being lazy and going missing quite often. Won’t be as bad if you kiss up to the managers, they’ll be nice with your schedules and throw big sales your way. Not that it really matters if you make big sales personally because you do not get extra compensation. Whole store has to hit a certain number every quarter to get a bonus. People were pretty chill, made a atmosphere of we are all screwed but at least we are all screwed together kind of thing. Great experience with the general public and I guarantee you will be a better person to retail workers everywhere after experiencing this. Honestly not terrible when you acknowledge the fact that this is a first job for tons of people and the lack of training and understanding is managements fault not the employees. Also they changed the discount so you get cables super cheap but hardware is full price. They also drug test. It can totally get competitive because they do expect you to hit a certain sales goal every day along with credit card apps"
good,"My biggest gripe with Best Buy is that you are graded based on how much you sell but you have no incentive to sell other than a yearly bonus that everyone needs to hit.  It was like being paid commission but not receiving any money for it, super stressful."
good,Alorica showed little to no care for there employees management and team leads tend to play favorites when it comes to growth in the company and they're isn't much room for growth like they say during training with these conditions for example someone who's had 10 years experience in a specific roles will get passed up for someone who has a few months experience but has been with the company longer and knows the people around well in conclusion Alorica shows even when they are the lowest rated job on Glassdoor and are close to losing there contract with geeksquad won't change anything about there company
good,"the best part about this job is working with customers and being able to interact with them/making them happy. There was never any problems with coworkers. My biggest issue was the management team. Some were okay but others were very lazy, often walked out for hours, everything was about high sale rates that were impossible to achieve with the very short hrs they give you. One manager was very mean and abusive and every coworker said they were tired of the harassment. Many reported this manager to HR, but they don't do anything about it. A lot of people left because of this. Also, your word as an employee does not matter to them. A customer can lie about your service and you will get written up because customer is always right."
good,"The management for Best Buy is horrible. I get being sales driven, but we don't work commission. So, being ready and able to throw someone under a bus is completely unnecessary. I did get to learn about a bunch of new products that I wasn't aware of before and that was nice. But they company and the management are not understanding and are snakes."
good,My typical day would be situated in the Mobile Department selling phones as well as the Home Theater section selling TV's and Sound Systems.
good,"Best buy started out as a great place to work. There were opportunities to move up, management team was hardworking and always helpful. Unfortunately, managers were moved around like domino pieces, and whatever culture/foundation was cultivated left along with them. The ""power vacuum"" allowed for mediocrity to slip in."
good,being a waiter is not like it use to be just get paid for less than minimum plus a mideocer tips
good,Management sucks. It's too many micromanagement going on. Never know who to listen too. Work you hard giving you a dream that you'll have the full time position just to let you see they hire external. But want you to train the person who took the position you worked hard for.
good,Management does not care about the employees and allowed customers to abuse them.
good,I learned about a lots of the differences in the products we carried as well as different accessories and exciting gadgets .
good,The employees are fun and cool people that most really enjoy being around.  The management just sucks most of the life out of the employees  with pressure to hit individual goals when the store is supposed to be based around a team oriented selling technique.
good,I would rather you find out for yourself about this company if positions are available to apply to. They really don't have work but around peak season.
good,They would be a great company to work for if they would focus more on their employees instead of letting people be driven to better employment....... No incentive to sell when the employees that care have to drag the rest of the store to get a bonus...... Incentives for the individual. Not the group
good,Very cliquey and has an environment of favoritism.  No room to move up.  Advancement rarely is an option for newcomers.  Sales associates regularly argue over sales.
good,Employees who want to advance have no opportunities in the warehouse.  Most who are in the full-time positions have been there for years and do not move or advance.
good,"For a first job, it was ok. I can't complain too much. We went through 3 GM's in the almost 4 years that I worked there. The promotion process is rigged."
good,"A typical day at work was standing for long hours hoping customers would come in to purchase appliances.  During down time, I would focus on polishing my skills by taking online training courses."
good,"Management is very hit or miss, some are very aggressive and rude. Good managers are absolutely amazing, but the bad ones are absolutely horrific. Makes working when certain managers are in rough."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The specific location I worked at is the one I’m doing this review for, most other bestbuy locations are completely different work environment. The bestbuy I worked for cares more about the employees they like more than productivity and they will expect crazy sales numbers no matter what the flow of customers are unless your somebody they like and they will try to bring big sales and baskets to you. If you are one of the unfavorable emoyees your work will go unnoticed and if your unlucky enough too get stuck in a speciality role the worst thing you could do to progress in the company is be good at the role because they will not take you out of because it’s hard to get people that do well in there specialty roles."
good,"Had real sad experience working here. Staff was okay, Managers were troubling and the general environment was horrifying to work. Was really sad to work."
good,"Raises rarely given, sick days nonexistent, managers are pushy and overbearing, pay scale is inconsistent and unfair, employees are constantly given excess amounts of work while others (the managers favorite) are given little workers and hand feed higher positions."
good,McDonald's mentality that workers are expendable and easily replaced cogs in a machine. Turn on you as soon as you ask for more money. Very little training almost all knowledge garnered by computer films.
good,"This company does not care about their employees. Management claims they care about their employees but they really do not. The coworker discount is great but management sucks. The work load is not worth the pay. There is no commission, even though there is room for it (for example when credit cards are opened)."
good,"If you can’t put up with costumers, don’t apply. Pay is low, not much room for promotion. Favouritism is shown, most empolyees know that costumers can search things on the web so they tend to disappear"
good,"management was horrible , Did not know how to run the store."
good,"The employee discount is fantastic on small items and accessories, there are some fun people but it can be a bit cliquey at time. Management  is under pressure to make number and this get passed on to the sales people."
good,"all in the description!! very bad experience at best buy, but was told it was only because of the location i worked at. location 160 in Durham NC, was the worst in the district while i worked there."
good,"Very basic in terms of a work day, sometimes slow but productive. Difficult to work with management as it was always changing. Training was the worst, expected to learn from looking at videos and reading but barely and hands on training especially with management not really helping in that matter. Some days were good and bad. My coworkers were great but management is clueless on how we actually work from the salesperson's point of view."
good,Terrible Culture. Management sucks! Doesn't listen. Employees are unprofessional. Unorganized. Biased. Always got funny looks from managers. No one ever introduced themselves to me. Never working here again.
good,It was an ok place to work didn't really feel appreciated. they expected too much out of you and expected you to work like a robot. Weren't ok with you talking to other people on the job.
good,Great for kids bad for adults trying to make a living also theres a lot of favoritism in the work place. Loss of hours at any random time and give you last minute changes to your shifts.
good,"This job was okay for being part time. I disliked retail overall, however. Low pay, lack of benefits, not enough hours, managers were barely ever around."
good,"typical work day consisted of finding a solution for every customers needs. cleaning and keeping the work area clean. upselling every customer possible. "
good,Sold appliances. Set up deliveries and warranties for customers. Expected to push the credit card. Usually only one person in the department on any given day. Even on weekends.
good,"While I was employed I found that the environment did not care for its employees much at all. While I understand that a retail world is dependent on making the customer happy and creating a returning customer; throwing an employee ""under the bus"" to please a customer is outlandish. Customers could and would on average say or claim any number of things about what an employee said or did, causing the employee to be punished for things that would not have actually happened. Then this lead to a lack of trust between employees and management, which just made working there difficult and extremely uncomfortable."
good,"Sales in mobile phones. I learned about 3 major carriers plans and about ANdroid and iOS platforms. The management at my store were fair but the hours stunk and we had to work holidays and evenings, sometimes overnight doing inventory. The hardest part was being away from family during the holidays and the most enjoyable was the discount."
good,"Great time"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"They over work the good worker, and doesn't have  accountability for those not working. one mod may have 6 worker, and other my have  3, because they are better workers"
good,"Advancement is based on gender!!!! ( Male) only, hours are based on how much you sales, if you are a poor performer no hours, very clicked rated company."
good,This work place is alright if your okay with management harassing you to constantly make sales in other departments that your not trained for and expect you to be knowledgeable.  Constantly complain if you don't reach a ridiculous amount of sales for your department.
good,A great job for a season.  Unload trucks.  Work on computers to get online orders ready.  Pack and stack boxes.  Unpack boxes.  Pack products on shelves neatly and completely!
good,"I was hired on as a Customer Service Representative all while being told I would transfer to a sales position after the holidays. I was never offered that position so I applied and interviewed for it. The manager told me I got the job and to wait until we hire more people to transfer me. Since then they have transfered others from my department to the sales floor and are still hiring people for those other positions that I was told belonged to me. I've been waiting for 2 months now. Management didn't earn their position, they were simply there for a long time."
good,"Lack of competent leadership from store level managers. No/lack of advancement. Its just an ordinary retail job, so don't expect more than that."
good,Management was horrible and everyone had a group mentality so as a new guy I did feel a little isolated until I basically got a group of my own.
good,If looking to work in electronic or appliance fields this is the place to start. Get the necessary knowledge and move on to better.
good,"During the slow times of the year, managers are encouraged to write up employees who do not achieve goals. During peak performance periods, ""nothing you do is ever enough"""
good,Management was not the best if you did not hang out with them outside of work then they would not give you many hours. Also too many insects there that management did not want to take care of.
good,"was not happy there the managers took credit for everything i put effort in doing, CC applications goals were met but no recognition was received poor management but awesome Discounts!"
good,The job experience wasn't too pleasant. It was all about the numbers and the customer wasn't priority.Employees were also highly expendable at the workplace.
good,"You know how you think a place would be perfect to work at just because the people who work there are nice? Negative. No. dont even think of best buy as that place. Typical day was a headache and a constant competition to be the managers ""fave"". If you did one thing wrong you would never hear the end of it. I only learned what the basics of customer service was. You ever see the move ""Waiting"" (if not go watch it"" thats how Best Buy was. Management was only cool with people who they worked with from other stores. They were buddy buddy with a select few people and the rest they didnt really care for. Hardest part of the job was walking into that place day after day and not committing social suicide. Enjoyable parts of the job....hmmmmm maybe the discounts."
good,This was a great job for someone in high school who has no bills to pay or family to support. However it the extremely low pay caps on all positions except management the possibility and hope of advancing to a point where you can make a good living is pretty much nonexistent.
good,"While working for this company, I have found a lack of leadership. The leaders do not lead, they more or less boss around. They do not work with you while trying to advance your career. Also, you do not get a lunch unless you are working there for a minimum of 7.5 hours."
good,my co-workers are fun and challenge me to learn new ways to solve problems on a daily basis. The management treats everyone like slaves. They do not care about your life outside of work.
good,"The job itself was easy to learn and do, however the company was very unorganized and at times very unprofessional. I learned how to multi-task by talking to customers on the phone while working the computer systems. I really enjoyed talking to the customers."
good,"My day is usually going in to down stock product on the floor, do a down stocking report, clean & bright of all the departments, changing out price tags."
good,I had a main job that was my main source of income and was required to travel for said job.  While trying to make sure that all of my shifts were covered I spoke with 3 different managers about the problem.
good,The Training for employees consisted of someone standing next to you for a few minutes and going over everything and leaving you alone. No hands one training. If you ask for help from a manager they tell you to figure it out on your own even if you need a managers approval.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You will talk to alot of customers and will have to deal with super angry ones from time to time. Not only are you held accountable for your work but for others as well. Working at Best Buy you WILL work holidays and weekends.
good,"Very stressful environment, a lot of work for very little compensation. Not a lot of advancement available"
good,"not sure how it is now but back in my days it was about telling the customer one thing and getting them to either buy something they really don't need or to add something ""free"" when checking out when in fact it was not."
good,"I enjoyed the customer service experience, but it was not a very employee friendly place. I did enjoy making the customer experience a good one."
good,"Greet customers, sell merchandise, run register and credit apps"
good,"a typical day of work included lifting fixtures, product, and various displays. management tended to never listen to some thing an employee that wasnt thier favorite said. hardest part of the job was constantly working over night on 12 to 15 hour shifts. the most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to travel."
good,Typical retail store where moving up is not a real option for most to move up. Great place to start out as a part-timer. Also you get to meet all different types of people.
good,Great benefits as far as store discount. This is a retail job so there's alot of customer interaction to help build interpersonal skills.
good,learn how to interact with customers better goin through training sessions and computer learnings . co workers was fun to work with . hardest part of job was tryin to get enough hours
good,As a sales transaction associate you can expect to spend the majority of your time at work standing around aimlessly starring at the ceiling wonder where you have gone wrong with your life. the labor itself is minimal and quite simple once you have worked the system multiple times the main factor that makes the job near intolerable is the management team. Expect to be taken advantage of your first six or seven months on the job as they test to see just how much they can get from you. This will prove to be the hardest part of the job as you will often question if it is worth your time to just sit back and accept the abuse. Promises of advancement with hard work are often left empty and unsatisfied. Management seems to give you just enough hope to stay in the position you are in and only until they are exhausted of all other resources they finally make good on their promises. Expect a twenty cent raise for nine months of hard work and dedication. The most enjoyable part of the job is the time spent helping customers understand and learn about the product they are purchasing.
good,"You walk in clock in, prep the displays, check/count inventory, clean, educate customers and sale. They pay is low, the stores are understaff and they want you to do everything all at once when you're pack with customers. They micro manage you. There's no leadership. They make you go annoy customers when they do not need to be bugged after you already offered to help them. The most enjoyable part is when you take a break, that's if they allow you to take a break."
good,"I stayed with this company hoping to advance into a leadership role.  I was dedicated to my work and devoted all of my time to this company.  I was not really valued as an employee and my hours were cut to a minimal amount.  An amount that I couldn't afford to stay employed.  "
good,The best thing about Bestbuy my fellow employees. The store i work in is very un stable are far as leadership. Their isnt any accountablity for the store in general.
good,• Responsible for product placement/stocking in store
good,"Hard to get more hours and management was unfair with movement within the company. Yet, other employees made it a fun atmosphere."
good,"they really treat you so bad specially if you are not originally american they are really racist , i dont know about all branches but the one i worked at was the worst job ever, they treat new people really bad"
good,I had fun with fellow employees and customers. There's opportunity to grow. From what I heard from current 2012 employees that they're now getting less hours for no sales. Sounds like they're stepping away from their non-commissioned idea from when I first started.
good,bestbuy is a good workplace..but has very little room to grow. Bestbuy in mount vernon was my store.
good,I work at the AP desk. Their is no team work and management does not care about employees. This is a number driven company and they do not care about shrink.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"ok place to work, changing schedules, not a lot of hours. hard to find keys when you need them, breaks and lunches are not watched or enforced. you are graded by what you sell when 90% of the time im not the one to ring them up."
good,Builds great people skills. It teaches employees how to deal with adversity because holiday season really brings out the worst in people. So when dealing with situations like that you build character yourself.
good,"I've made some great friends, and Acquaintances in my few years. But management is very sales heavy, And often doesnt consider what a customer actually wants. Company lives by ""the customer doesnt know what they want""."
good,"Working there part time is amazing, people are generally nice and easy to get along with. When it comes to advancing its far and in between with chances. Hours will also vary depending on the season and demand,."
good,"Every thing is taught through through e leanings, The job is relatively simple, its a sales position you sell, talk to customers, use open ended questions, and see what you can attach to the sale. management coaches you by having you look at a sheet and saying where you are weak and strong and they tell you to improve."
good,"Great job to gain experience to move on. Sales and product knowledge training was exceptional. Upper management often withdrawn and out of touch with the sales floor. Compensation for sales should include a commission, it was my experience that I was not compensated enough for the amount of revenue generated and the metrics required to not be ""coached"" or terminated.  "
good,No one is really rewarded for meeting the metrics that the company has laid out. The issues i think i had with the place i worked for was the management team. They didn't strive to learn about they regular employees only catered to the management team.
good,"Working at best buy, was a okay job most of the time. Management can be a bit of a pushover sometimes seemingly bending over to customers wills and sometimes even giving us trouble for not getting numbers that mean nothing to better us"
good,At times the place was a great place to be. But the poor management and the lack of communication made it a hard company to work for. But the discount was amazing!
good,"I loved being around all of latest technology and loved my coworkers. However management was horrible, I went through at least 4 general managers out of the 3 years I was there. Supervisors and assistant managers were rude."
good,"Best Buy is a great company. Employed for  a very long time  leaving due to constant restructuring causing demotion twice. Geek Squad became Apple Certified causing triple work with no compensation. Training was poor for certifications leading to client disappointment, low GS morale. In many years I’ve never seen the amount of stress it caused with fellow employees and myself. This was my breaking point unfortunately I had hoped to be with Best Buy until retirement. I felt undervalued among my fellow employees."
good,Very fast pace with limited time to focus on daily work task. Poor management and not so friendly work environment. The leadership team is more business driven then team driven. Micromanaging is a huge issue and the leaders see the employees as a number and not a human.
good,"When I first started working at Best Buy I was extremely excited.  My first two years of the 8 I worked there were wonderful.  As the economy started to tank, so has the culture that I was taught when I first arrived.  In order to keep me engaged at work, the Management decided to bring a group of potential leaders to help them become better leaders in the company.  As it turned out, it was a ploy to keep the older employees engaged as non of these people in the group were ever promoted to leadership.  I continued to drink the Kool-Aid, and was given the opportunity to help my department when they had no supervisor.  I lead the team meeting, sat in on the supervisor meetings, worked the schedule and coached and train the employees.  What happened when I applied for the supervisor spot?  Well it turns out I wasn't good enough friends with management in order to be in that spot.  I was offered a consultation prize.  Team lead with no added benefits.  I continued to do my work, and review time was up, I was given a decent review, and although I went well beyond my scope of work, I was only given a lower score, because ""No one is allowed to score higher than a 3 in the reviews""  Those were the exact words that was given to me from my reviewing supervisor.  Along with my score of 3, I also got a 10 cent raise, for taking on a stretch assignment with no extra compensation.  The last straw was when I was being told to close Black Friday after working 2 hours past my scheduled time, and the closing manager decided to let the people who were scheduled to close leave early.  Best Buy"
good,"Not a good place to work if you are looking for career advancement. I worked At Best Buy for over 3 years and it was an absolute waste of time. I worked as a merchandising specialist, our  team was very knowledgeable about everything in the store including prices, products location, we were the technicians, salesman, even set up the store’s advertisements. Even with all of those qualities we found that we were paid the less amount in wages."
good,"If you are a sales associate here, you're basically just working here for money especially in California. There are no real life long benefits of working with Best Buy. You don't make enough money to survive off of in the long run."
good,"The environment fed on the Sales department rather than the services provided. It would be far better to treat as two separate companies, to prevent the need for high pressure tactics, rather than focusing on the services available."
good,Terrible. Best Buy only caters to their management. Wants you to do the most at work when their pay is terrible. Management pick who they like and give them more hours.
good,I enjoyed working at Bestbuy as a part-time job while I was also focusing full time with my studies. I would help customers in various departments and ensure all their questions were answered to the best of my ability.
good,"It can get stressful sometime. Pressure to go beyond the required productivity or to meet in just within few days of starting, but the team tends to ease up on you after some time."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This is not a good choice for a career. There are little to no advancement opportunities and when there are it's like a scrap of meat thrown to ravenous dogs. Accept, instead of the hungriest strongest getting the position/promotion it's the most popular. Pay isn't the worst but it's also the same or less than a gas station job. Management is terrible in most or all aspects."
good,"It was a while ago since I've worked there, but the management was always atrocious, ""promoting"" from within, only to lay off everyone who gets promoted. Knowing someone is the only way to advance here."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for. The  only issue that I experienced at my store location was terrible management. If there was a change in management it would be the best place to work.
good,"I've been to other stores and can honestly say that the environment definitely depends on the upper management. The lower level employees were awesome. The leaders cared about their employees but had no control over other aspects in the store. You are required to sell a certain amount of product but if they give you the worst shopping hours, you will never make that goal, then they cut your hours even more because you didn't make goal."
good,"It's becoming a sweatshop again."
good,"I really enjoy getting to work hands on with my employees and customers. You learn a lot very fast but have to do it on your own. Fort the most part the culture is very inclusive however you do have to step on other people to get noticed. For salaried employees there is no work/ life balance. You are expected to work 50 hours a week minimum and 6 days a week during the holidays. There is the constant threat of disciplinary action by district management and above for not hitting your numbers. There is a huge mentality of you owe me if your store is missing its numbers. The quarterly bonus's are nice when you get them, but they are increasingly harder to get every quarter. There is a huge disconnect between your direct district and market leadership vs what corporate wants- lots of corporate says to do this but we are going to do this instead.  I would say the hardest part of the job is having to retain great talent. Line level employees are paid horribly for the amount of work they are required to do."
good,Good company for those who want a start up job. This is the perfect job for those who’d like to learn about customer service experiences. They’re all about helping.
good,We were forced to ask guest if they need help so much that must of their customers get mad and leave.It was like being a car salesman that nobody wants to talk to.
good,"Not the worst place to work, but far from the best. Management is not terribly concerned about employees. Hard to advance, hard to get raises. Keep your resume up-to-date."
good,Management expects way too much and there's no compensation for great work being completed. They criticise your work instead of trying to help you improve.
good,Even if you make sales the management harasses you. Pressure to conform to ridiculous corporate standards. Very poorly managed and a tendency to promote competition among peers without compensation to reflect the results.
good,nothing to say the company is how ever you let it to be Provided service to customers who made online orders as well as returns.
good,"The managers are so out of date and they will use their walkie-talkie/radio and question you more than help you. I was there for 3.5 years, I know what happens and doesn't happen in certain instances, and you go around the rules to help someone out... why? Inconsistency makes you look nice and loses all credibility with me because this is your job, not some personal thing. Managers are 212 are the most inconsistent and they micromanage me? These people need to be managed by someone who what they are doing before they even dare try to manage me."
good,"I told my boss I wouldn't be able to work two of my regular scheduled days because I had orientation at my second job. He rudely asked me why I got a second job and I told him it was because my hours had been cut. He promptly asked me to collect my things because I was fired for not giving a ""two week"" notice. Even tho I had no intention of leaving Best Buy."
good,If you already have IT experience you will be extremely bored at best buy. Most of their stuff is automated and they don't let you experiment very much with anything outside of their process.
good,"It was a boys club, I was one of the best salesmen in the company and was pushed down by my co-workers because I am a female in the IT industry. I was let-go with a poor excuse."
good,"Management just stands around not helping when floor is busy. Training is average most of the time your just thrown into the department and have to learn on your own. Associates are friendly with each other, management not so much. Working weekends and holidays are the hardest part of the job."
good,Management is forced to bully you when sales goals are not met and will continue to do so until if and when you are terminated for lack of performance in credit cards/ electronic protection plans.
good,"Low pay, poor leadership, hours are never consistant, I wouldnt recommend this company other than to someone just entering the workplace.  Management is not consistant."
good,Company  expects every employee to look at the big picture.  This means your day starts with them giving you the budget expectation and reminding you how the previous day was a failure.  Management is lax on actually helping with unhappy customers.  Part time employees are expecting to perform at high levels without any of the benefits.  It is super hard to hold a second job or go to school because even as a part time they schedule you for over 30 hours every other week.  No benefits provided even though you work over 32 hours every other week.  Will cut hours in the middle of the work week due to one or two bad budget days that do not match with the previous years performance.  Budget from previous time does not take into account the previous day last year was a weekend and a high dollar day. Provided employees come to work on time they only get fired during the yearly culling before holiday hires.  This means you will work with people who do the bare minimum of their job requirements.  Management will just give up on these employees and ignore them.  Meanwhile management will work the  employees still performing to the bone until they burn out and become minimum job requirement type employees or quit.  Lots of people quit on short notice due to poor management.
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for. The employee discount is great. But management only think about themselves and don't really care about your well being.
good,after 6 years with the company i have experience a lot of ups and downs depending on what position i was working or what store location i was assigned to. overall this company has been good to me but it is time to move on to something better.
good,"Best Buy is a ok job. Its the job you want while your working towards your goals in life and getting set up for what you want to do for a living. DO NOT LET THIS BECOME YOUR CAREER. Management at these stores is awful and there is very little room for advancement within this company unless you know how to play company politics. The only people to get higher up jobs such as management and general management are people who have worked within the company for 10 to 15 plus years and the people above those jobs have been there even longer. This is a very dead end job that should only be seen as a stepping stone in life. You have the opportunities to change job titles and stores with the company easily but ultimately you either work in Sales, Inventory or Operations. Training is mostly done on a need to know basis or from a mundane computer database your expected to stare at for hours at a time and learn the aspects of your job with no real supervision. Maybe all stores aren't like this but I'm speaking from the experience of working in 3 of the 4 stores in Memphis."
good,"I would not work that b/c it is run as, a personal play toy, rather than a professional work environment.  You should be able to feel safe and encouraged to give yourself to a company.  When you work 40+ hours a week, consider travel time, and what ever work you may do at home to help you catch up while you're at work, that equals more time spent for that company than time you spend for yourself and or your family."
good,i enjoyed working here but i had to many differences of opinion with the management staff it was fun to help customers find there home theatre needs including blurays and tvs the hard part was remembering what tvs had promotions and what came with the promotions
good,"I got hired for inventory. Having worked inventory elsewhere I was appalled at the hours (holidays, midnights) and rate of starting pay. Just not worth it."
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, there was no commission so you didn't have that pressure however there were always a lot of other quotas and metrics you encouraged to hit that didn't involve or over any extra compensation."
good,"basic day was always slow on weekdays. Not many customers throughout week which led to a big increase in inactivity at best buy. But its location gave us many customers with big purchases so store usually made rev and extra everyday. Upper management was great until new GM came in. Completely turned place around which led to its little ""ecosystem"" destroyed."
good,"glad for the opportunity, not very friendly people. have their own groups"
good,"The work is great, the management is not. Like many jobs in the industry, days are long, trying, which is expected. However what is not expected is the inept mismanagement that forces anyone with talent and skills to look elsewhere."
good,Working at BestBuy starts as a rewarding experience but quickly becomes a terribly negative experience. They promise you hours at first and then cut you down to the bare minimum. While you are at work they try to overload you with work while you are still expected to help customers and meet quotas on revenue. Managers also tend to contradict you in front of customers making them think you have no knowledge.
good,Position was great experience but no room to advance. Love sells met my goals .
good,"During the 2013 holiday I took a job working for the Geek Squad handling the shipping and receiving duties of the department, however, I was also responsible for customer service and triaging clients. Most of the time the staff hardly cared about their jobs and frequently called out leaving holes in shifts, which required myself to handle more tasks than my position was intended to support. "
good,A satisfactory employer despite lacking better advancement opportunities.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have worked in different departments. the only time they let you move is if it will greatly benefits them. they let go people who take pride in their work. "
good,"I worked at Best Buy for almost two years. During the  two years I worked my way from cashier, to running our Windows/Microsoft store  as the Full time associate. Everyone in my department and most of the surrounding departments can always count on me to know the answer if they have any questions about almost anything. Even though I work extremely hard and try to get all the tasks done that nobody else wants to do, I still am constantly harassed about my performance. On top of that, my compensation is a complete joke. The people that I am training on a daily basis are actually getting paid for than I am and they are part time workers. I don't feel that it's fair to pay me any less than the people that i'm supposed to be in charge of, much less almost 25 cents per hour. Over all, I used to love coming to work, now I dread going everyday, but still work just as hard hoping it will change. As it is, don't expect to be able to get by with the minimum requirements of life ( three meals a day, studio apartment, car and phone) without a second job."
good,"it all starts out great but once your in the manager treat you like a nobody, associates get a very small bonus while the mangers gets a big bonus without doing any work.... I can never make this out of a career!!!!"
good,I worked for the company for 3yrs. I loved to help customers and learn the buisness. The biggest thing wrong with the store i worked for is managment was unfair. Also never took care of issues presented to them in the employee aspect.
good,A team meeting and sales.
good,"Could not get the schedule I wanted, improper training, was not allowed off at the time I was scheduled, and no sign of pay raise or advancement in the company. Very disappointed."
good,hard working employees unorganized learn more advance electronics customers were enjoyable
good,"Started off with a very positive energy when hired for the Best buy camera position. Later, I find that many people who were hired about 7-8 months later were being paid much higher. There is no set starting wage, im sure the GM just grabs numbers from a hat. There is also a major flaw with the management. Supervisors of each department would slack and go on frequent breaks, leaving the selling up to regular part-timers. Even after multiple complaints, nothing is done to fix the situation. Working at best buy, you get to see their true motives, we are not on commission, but are still hounded from supervisors to sell the service plans with sense of urgency. After being bossed around constantly all day, and being scolded for not having better ""numbers"", then having to smile through it all, was definitely the hardest part of working at a Best Buy. I've transferred to 3 places now, and the story is all so similar from one Best Buy to the other."
good,"Was a cashier/ sales and learned so much on my own, working hands on goes a long way. Co-workers were helpful and managers were always hard to find."
good,Best Buy is struggling to stay relevant. The margins in the industry have diminished. In addition to that. It is not possible for a Public Corporation so large too be nimble enough to offer services cheaply or effectively
good,no matter what you do unless you kiss the managers butts you will not move up. good store but horrible management. fellow co workers where awesome though.
good,Simple work
good,"I first want to start with I have found more friends at Best Buy than I ever had in my life. Many employees pour their heart into this company but, receive little in return. I feel this company lost a lot of its core values over the years and care more about making a buck then making sure their employees/customers were happy."
good,"managers are horrible, they expect the impossible and always get on your case for not doing enough, at the same time they have hour long meetings right in the middle of the store and talk about how their workers are horrible and should be fired. Training is non-existent and most workers are brain-washed to think that this is an actually good place to work."
good,"I worked for Best Buy for three years. It was a great job as a college student but I couldn't see myself working for the company as a career. There is no way to move up within the store, let alone advancing into corporate. It's a fun first/part time job but don't expect anything more."
good,"management Sucks,they tell u one thing and do another ,a good thing if u need time off they will usually approve it"
good,"Typical day at work was about a four hour day. Right away under pressure, because either numbers hadn't been good for the day, or we could have blown our numbers out of the water and still high preasure to sell to customers. Processes were backwards from selling stratagies, managment promoted, not the hardest workers, but one's who they got along with."
good,"Started out with a solid management team and I loved my job. We worked as a store and were doing relatively well as a store, but then the managers slowly got advancements in the company. When that happened, the entire store culture changed. It became about sales and ONLY sales. No matter how good you were with customers, no matter how hard you worked, if all you didn't get the sales? You sucked. Most of the people have left because of that."
good,it can be a career but i seen too many people been there for 10 years and still supervisor.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a nice place to work while going to school because they work with your schedule, but other than that there are no real pros to working here."
good,working there educated me a lot on electronics. they really train to know what you need to take to customers and sell. don't know about other locations but the germantown store lacks good managements.
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work and interact with customers; however, when it came to the management I, and many of my fellow co workers, felt like it was the complete opposite. Working at best buy there was hardly any room for growth, unless you were extremely close to the managers."
good,I was injured on the job and had to take medical leave and my immediate manager treated me badly during that injury. It was not a pleasant experience.
good,The culture and what the GM believes in determines whether or not you will have a successful life there. We did not have a very good GM when I was employed there. He lacked the people skills and customer service skills necessary to be a great leader. I wish that he did better in providing a better culture for his employees and proper advancement training.
good,"•	Lead and manage the sales floor. Manage Sales Associates and conduct training and role play scenarios. Was active Manager on duty, when General Manager was not in store."
good,"No Commission, angry customers that already know what they want and hourly pay with no promotion opportunity. Expect to sell thousands of dollars of computers and printers, all to meet a sales figure of 800 dollars a day."
good,"Job then family"
good,"Pay was low, but the job is mostly searching for younger people in school rather than those who are older and looking for more pay and benefits to suit their living needs."
good,Shipping department u don't get any help loading the trucks and in the full case ur picking big tv up and if there are 25 + u have to take them off the pallet and toss them on the line and  if u drop them u go for a drug test and they have them on the top floor it is very hard work and fast pace job and at peak season u don't have a life
good,There was a lot of micromanagement. Managers were constantly evaluating each sale you made and wanting you to milk as much money from each customer as possible without regard for whether or not there would be a benefit to them.
good,"Unfortunately, there is too much gossip, (it's like high school) and if your manager doesn't like you they will do everything to make you miserable, , include lie to your face about things that never happened."
good,best buy really expects you to put your all into the job while they pretty much pay you close to minimum wage. worked there for three years and new hires with no experience were getting paid more based off of who management liked more. great discount. angry customers.
good,"I was with the company for a little over five years. It was not too bad of a place to work at, but the goal wasn't about finding the best solution for the customer, but the most money that we can get. IT was about attaching everything possible to every sale, which is unrealistic I would have a perfect sale, but if I did not sell a Total Tech Support, or a credit card application, then the sale didn't mean anything to the managers. If I did good one month, the managers would act like they are my friend and talk to me, but if it was the other way around, the managers would not coach to improve unless they cared about the individual (favoritism)."
good,"I enjoy the Best Buy store etiquette and wish there was more opportunity for advancement or more hours, but there was not enough to keep me there, unfortunately."
good,"It is not a bad job, unfortunately the stress of changing work wages and management inability to recognize the work that one does; makes the work more stressful then need be."
good,"A lot of management is childish and has favorites. They make empty promises and hire out of nepotism. Lots of ""passing the buck"" to other managers to avoid responsibility."
good,"Best Buy is a nice place to start your career in IT with Geek Squad or to get your foot in the door with sales. Best Buy’s job culture has started to decline with a few re-orgs that happened within the last 3 years. Compensation isn’t very fair, benefits are starting to go away or be in categories that employees aren’t interested in. Bonus structure changed from a monthly basis to a quarterly basis and rather than going by a store’s revenue, its based off of revenue and the store’s OI."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,There is alot of favoritism and gossiping which then leads to a toxic work environment. Company as a whole has changed its perspective on customer service. It is now a numbers based company rather than a customer based company.
good,I mean a job is a job and they all suck. Most have benefits which isn't the problem at Best Buy. It is the clients/customers that make the job stressful along with the assigned work hours and schedule. Retail is the worst. Other than constantly having to solve client problems and issues it is hard to learn and thrive within the company.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees. Merchandisers typically have lots of projects with price changes and sometimes resets. Time frames of completion are unrealistic.
good,"Expected to work quickly with as many clients as possible, Resolve multiple computer and client related problems. Focus both on helping the client and helping the company equally. The hardest part is focusing on how to assist clients and manage their expectations with regards to time frame and results (i.e. a 10 year old laptop isn't ever going to perform like a top of the line brand new one out of the box) The most rewarding part was correctly identifying and repairing a clients device to their satisfaction"

good,"Very hard to manage school and work, managers are very strict about open availability. You do everyone's job but do not get compensated for it. Unfair favoritism throughout stores."
good,"Most of the other employees were nice, but when the management seemed unorganized. They would even get angry at the employees under them when the stock dropped in price. We would reach our sales goals and the only thing we would get in return was a free drink sometimes. There was hardly a chance of moving up, and people would quit within a few months due to no chance of advancement or higher pay. The workplace was dirty, the bathrooms needed remodelling, and the water fountain was broken. They punish you for taking time off by taking away your days of work later. I asked for a night off and then I looked on the app, and then I didn't have any more hours the next week."
good,Like the people I work with and I enjoy helping customers.Most of my coworkers are pleasant to work with.Our customers are from a variety of places across the United States
good,"As a job itself it isn't too bad, however the culture of the company is extremely disgusting. "
good,"If you're starting out or are in-between jobs, this might be a good option for you. Otherwise, it's best to try to get into your professional field and try to keep on advancing."
good,"If you are looking to get into the workforce as a teenager this is a great start, but lifers beware. I worked at Best Buy for most of my teenage career, and by the time I got out I had the necessary skills to move into a non retail job without the constant fear of ""District""."
good,If you like to deal with difficult customers then this is the job for you. Somedays you'll get great customers who are respectful and easy to deal with. Human resources is a complete joke with the company If you have a complaint against the general manager of your store it gets swept under the rug.
good,"Start at 8am as an installer, end at 4 or later. Which isnt an issue. The pay stinks. They low ball you so they can keep labor costs low. You're supposed to be an Install Technician, but they pressure you to do nothing but make sales in home, and keep time spent in home extremely low. However installing appliances isn't always quick and easy. You never know what you're going to run across in someone's house so you might be there for the 45mins they give you, or you might be there for 3 hours. So you'll never hit your ""Targets"" you'll always be told you need improvement so when the yearly review comes around they give you as little as possible. "
good,"The job makes you feel like you work on commission because you are constantly tracked and punished if you don't ""sell"" computers. It has changed somewhat since I left, but for the constant harrassment micro managing it was not worth the time or money. I enjoy helping people with their tech needs thats why IT is primary career path, but what could have been a pretty good job is overshadowed by the subpar supervisors, micro management, and door to door sales feel of a job."
good,"Management killed my opinion of this company. Worked 6 months, trained 2 people, did  34-38 hours a week as a part timer, had more hours than a full timer, pay was bad too"
good,Maagers do absolutely nothing and the work falls on the part time and full time sales reps. you are judged only  mbers and are expected to preform in an unfair work environment in which friends get the pay raises over those who work hard
good,Most of the time you're just standing around. People don't come in anymore unless they have something specific in mind. Most people know what they want when they come in so there not much to do.
good,Very fast paced environment  they appear to working for a more online presence. Online orders have increased by 500 percent over the past three years.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy says they have a Company Policy built on Cultural Diversity, Fairness, Honesty and Integrity.  The fact is that they generally promote from within, they encourage nepotism, they encourage ""Diversity"" to the point of glossing over serious HR violations to avoid upsetting population groups within the workforce at the expense of the dedicated and hard working associates.  They weed people out with a ""Catch 22"" clause of ""failing to live up to company standards"".  It's a loophole they use to terminate people without any real cause. I believe they discriminate against Seniors in their workforce and their ""open door, no retaliation, whistleblower policy is not adhered to."
good,Depending who you work with it will be a great day or a bad one. Pretty simple job and very laid back at times. Leadership is not always very reliable.
good,"It's a mind-numbing tedious job. The bond I've developed with my coworkers is quite nice, however everything else about the job is unpleasant. Management is either overworked but trying their best, or perpetually grumpy and rude."
good,"Best Buy is definitely a decent company if you're looking for a different place to work or possibly a job while in school.  However, it is a very clique based place.  Unless you're in the clique, it's a nightmare."
good,It is a retail position with no incentive for growth.  Typical big box issues.....The store manager was more interested in reducing costs than growing the business.
good,Enjoyed working with best buy as a supervisor.  Helped me hone my management skills working in different departments.  Just did not have career advancement.
good,I was number 1 in sales & getting best buy credit cards apps out. After achieving every goal i had alot of empty promises made to me that benifit the company more then it benifit me. At the end i felt used an taken advatage of. They are a great company but they need to take better care of the employees in store that make things happen daily.
good,workplace culture can either be a fast pace or slow pace depending on the time of the day and month. Holiday season it is very fast paced and long hours on your feet. Long work hours for black Friday.
good,"Geek squad is a great place to get your IT feet wet. However, it is hard to advance with the company. Management stinks at many of the locations and the customers are entitled."
good,"I believe the company as a whole is likely a positive one but the individual store i worked at, had a poor culture, poor leadership and was not a good fit"
good,Your working your butt off and they don't notice and the employee that are through the company take longer breaks and lunch and they don't get in trouble or told anything it's about favorites
good,If you have family within best buy its great you'll move up if not you may end up working for someone you have trained. Not all is bad its really just the management.
good,"It’s a great first job. But the location where I was was awful. Management was the issue they are rude,don’t show respect,no room for advancement, there are some good things."
good,The typical day at work could be slow and boring or fast and exciting. I didnt learn much while working there. the management was very laid back and chill. I had a hard time figuring out who my superiors  were. The culture was pretty much to sell as much as possible and make sure customers leave with a credit card. The hardest part of the job was the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job were the discounts.
good,"I worked for Best Buy as a seasonal cashier. It was an okay job. Nothing horrible, but nothing to rave about either. Would be a great job for a college student or after school job for a high school kid."
good,"I only worked as a temporary for a specific project, so I don't know much about their benefits.  I met some great people, however as a whole there wasn't much synergy.  Some people there acted superior to others which doesn't promote a healthy culture."
good,We would come for our shift and load walls . we would unload the walls and ship the customers items to them as soon as we recieve them. I enjoyed putting the wall the most.
good,"great work environment . to be honest I don't have much to say, the environment was great until we switched general managers. after that, the stores work environment was unwelcoming."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It was cool to work there. Not somewhere you would want to be for a long time. Management wasnt very good, The general manager had no experience working for best buy at all. In the future , do not force people to write a review for you. Pay more to employees and only hire qualified management."
good,I loved my job with Best Buy when I lived in Wisconsin as soon as I moved quit because management at new store was terrible they almost fired me for being late just one time and constantly wanted me to do the work of a six man crew by myself
good,"Great benefits for someone just entering the work force. The opportunities for growth are slim. No work life balance, can consume you if your drink the kool aid. Not a company to promote work life balance. I'd never forget the 1st year they asked us to sacrifice time with our families to work thanksgiving day"
good,"Best Buy taught me a lot of skills that I appreciate.  However, I feel that the compensation for the work required is not satisfactory.  With many burger joints paying their employees $14 an hour, at Best Buy you are expected to know a huge volume of information about many different products, contracts, plans, warranties, and technical aspects while only being compensated around $11 an hour.  It's retail, so plan on missing out on family events over weekends and holidays."
good,Good place to leaden systems and practices to use in life. Great discounts. Top of the line employee training and providing resources to learn. Competitive atmosphere
good,Constant reminders that if you didn't sell warranties you were an underperformer. Long wait times when requesting keys to unlock cages to get product for customers.
good,"I worked at Bestbuy for about two years. The people I worked with were great. Best people I've met, whoever the company didn't really care about the people that work for them. There are discounts on certain products but their health benefits are one of the worst in the nation."
good,"I enjoyed working here until I got a better understanding of what goes on behind the curtain. Managers are irresponsible and harsh, and tend to not care for us employees on a personal level."
good,overall a good job I was in high school and it was pretty cool and professional for the most part some of the cons was the coworkers but you will encounter negative people anywhere.
good,"I started at smaller location, and I was able to get advancement within my store, pretty easily. Until it came to lead positions. they fought tooth and nail to get me OUT of that store.  When I was promoted out of a store with great culture and lots of friends and a great development community, I was thrust into a very successful (numbers wise) store, that didn't care about culture or advancement. They only cared about numbers. My leadership didn't support me, they left me alone to do my job, which is fine, except when the numbers weren't there, they wouldn't even offer me advice. Just told me to fix it. They started holding me accountable for things they couldn't hold me accountable for. Things that, by SOP, were not things they could hold me accountable for."
good,Great for people starting in the work force and as a first job or those who really enjoy learning new technology. Also great with customer service face to face.
good,"Workplace culture is pretty good, must know and love to be up to date with technology. Best buy is fast paced so if you are someone who cannot handle being quick selling wise i do not recommend."
good,"BestBuy culture is confused, managers and corporate want to different things. They really push you and will use policies to remove you, if you do not meet expectations. Customers don't understand that employees are only making minimum wage, if not %5 more."
good,"Geek squad has a wonderful culture centered around being the best and doing the best work for the customer while still enjoying your job and having fun. It was the best part about working with my precinct, is it felt like a family fixing things together. However due to it being tied into a retail store, and managed by a best buy store manager, your ability to advance and do more then simply stay in the precinct, (1 or 2 jobs, 3 if you count manager over geek squad) is correlated with how much your store manager cares about your department. in my case, it wasn't a lot, i was always told if i wanted to advance, i'd need to go to the floor and sell (Counter to what i was told in orientation, and also be prepared, at geek squad you will be in a sales role with the idea of selling plans to customers.) This is an entry level position with a lot of room for PERSONAL growth as you will see things from customers that will give you a very deep familiarity with basic computer trouble shooting. But understand advancement and communication from store to geek squad is rough at best, and non-existent at worst."
good,"Like most retail jobs, it was very fast-paced but extremely stressful. low pay for the amount of training required and responsibilities given to employees"
good,"Customers come in waves, the typical day could be fast paced or you would do a lot of down stock because there is so much free-time. I learned how to cooperate with coworkers and how to handle customers who were upset. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. Management varied in likes and dislikes, some were easy to work with while others weren't."
good,"The managers were very cut-throat, didn't seem to care much about their employees. Each section of the store that you worked in had there own manager and own benefits. So, if you worked in the warehouse, you weren't privy to things others were."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical days at work included helping users pick items or repair depending on which position I held at the time."
good,"Management can make or break you here. If you are not buddy buddy with some of them, you are going to have a rough time. No real training, you get thrown to the wolves, or have to learn on a computer screen, which can be a blessing and curse. They act like your life revolves around this company which is appalling. it can be a lot of fun while serving time here. The pay system is rigged, but if you learn the ropes you can make a decent check, with nice benefits if you are full time."
good,It's OK to work here if you really like technology. If you like sales then you will like it here. Just be wary with your co-workers and managers you work with.
good,"Travailler chez Best Buy peut être exigeant. Pour ma part, j'ai été engagée à temps partiel à cet endroit et j'avais un horaire de temps plein. "
good,enjoyable job but just not getting compensated financially enough to stay long term. Good starting spot for a younger person looking to get some experience and some spending money.
good,Geek Squad is a company in best buy that deals with computer repairs and troubleshooting problems for PC. The pay is good but the culture of the job stinks. Management is very young and poorly trained. Professionalism of the department does not exits. If you looking for a easy dollar but a ton of stress Geek Squad is the job for you.
good,Working in the computer section you have to be on top of your game all the time because you have to sell a certain amount everyday. That creates a stressful environment. Management as a whole is pretty good they are focused on the job and make sure it gets done.
good,"Best Buy Canada Ltd. operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY). Best Buy Enterprise is a multinational retailer of technology, entertainment products and services with a commitment to growth and innovation. Working with BBY was a great pleasure but I have closely seen that the company goes through structural changes and lack job security ."
good,"My location was typically slow, so not only did you have to sell things to the customers that did come in, but you had other tasks to do as well. A typical day consisted of greeting and understanding what the customer needs or wants and during the downtime re stocking shelves or making sure displays worked. I learned a lot about electronics and how they can be utilized in the home. Management was good at first, but then started to fall off as time went by."
good,"The week's schedules didn't go out until Monday morning if they went out at all. I often received calls at 6:30am on a Monday with orders to come into work for 8am. The pay did not match the work required. Between selling, restocking, researching the products, and learning the match-your-price option, there was too much to do with the little pay we received."
good,semi alright place to work if you need to money staffs is nice but customers are horrible depending on location good pay. good place to learn about electronics
good,"If you just want experience in a fast paced, retail environment, Best Buy is the way to go. You have to learn on your toes and very quickly but there are a lot of cons. "
good,"Fun place to work yet very rude people working there. Usually do cashiering and one person at each station at night, learned about new items and technology"
good,"It is a typical retail job, but the management was completely inept. The average employees were great people, and the jobs themselves were easy enough."
good,"I absolutely loved the first store I worked at - my assistant store manager was passionate about all aspects of the store, not just sales. She also cared for her employees, and would be there for us if we needed her for things other than work. The first store was pretty much like family. My direct supervisor knew his role well and always checked in on his team and would help if necessary. "
good,"Car audio did not get very much business so my first few hours I was cleaning or rearranging product."
good,"People (your piers) were great. Typical day was stressful."
good,"This is a fun part time job, not a full time job for someone who actually wants to make money.  The management is biased and there's no room to move up in the company unless you want to make $11/hr for 5 years straight, then they might look at you."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The best part of working for Best Buy is definitely the people you work with. Coworkers are great, usually college students, all fun and around the same age. Best Buy is a little too corporate for my taste (they would rather you lie in order to sell door crasher deals than tell the truth and recommend other products). They were also incredibly pushy in meeting sales goals and did not take into consideration what department you were put in (eg., they would put the only two female sales associates in the Wearables department and say ""Sell $850 worth of FitBits today"" in the middle of November, and put all the male associates in Laptops and give them a goal of $850 - easily one laptop's price). There are three different departments, with a manager and supervisor for each, and a General Manager. None of these managers seem to communicate with each other, as they are all on different pages. My biggest complaint would be that after the Christmas season, I was told by my sales supervisor that my seasonal contract was over and then I was offered a permanent position as a full-time sales associate. BUT a few hours later, I was told that my contract was over and my last shift would be the next day by a DIFFERENT manager. This is incredibly unprofessional, there is ZERO communication among the three different departments and the management tiers. This is NOT how you run a business. Overall, if it weren't for the great friends I made at this job, I would give this experience a lower rating. If you have no problem lying to people over expensive products that they have to save money for,"
good,"More often than not it seems the management become friends with certain employees, giving them more benefits, more options for designing their ideal schedules, more options for advancement."
good,"The pay is awful, discount is pointless."
good,I don't really have anything to say other then I didn't like working here                          .                                                                                                                    .
good,"I originally worked in the Boston location which I loved, but it was tough to move up. After a year or so, I finally got ""promoted"" to Geek Squad. I added quotation marks, because they tried to keep me at the same pay rate despite it being a higher job level. My store eventually closed, and due to this, I was forced to take a part-time position at the Cambridgeside location in Cambridge, MA. There, I was promised promotion, after promotion as long as I outperformed others'. I exceeded all of my goals as a part-timer, surpassing the full-timers, and I was still told I needed to do more. I eventually left the company, at the same position, I started in."
good,"Okay for easy money, but they are not great for anything else. The people you work with at their office seem only interested in their commission, and after that they don't care about your contract, because they can replace you."
good,"I learned a great deal about new technology and debugging all kinds of problems with computers, tablets, and phones (to mention a few)."
good,"Start shift, usually one opener & one closer, work on daily assignments which includes inventory, down stocking, sales, register & making the daily metrics. The department I worked in was required to do $900 per hour, 30% accessories, 3% protection plans & at least 1 credit card application. Best Buy used to be a fun place to work however with all the new changes over the past few years they have gotten more concerned about numbers without seeing the environment in the store."
good,"I enjoy my job, I enjoy assuring a client that the website that they were attempting to go on isn't putting on a virus that will delete their hard drive in five minutes if the don't dial some random number. And I enjoy the looks on my clients, faces when a job well done is presented before their eyes with no complications what so ever. I even enjoy that one person who brings a $2 dollar radio from CVS and expects us to fix it for them or even the one ""Crazy Person"" who believes the government is hacking their computer. I love everything about my job except for one simple thing, the constant badgering of the idea of Pushing GeekSquad Services on people who can barely afford a new Hard Drive. And it's heart Breaking that in order to help those said, people, I Have to ask them would they like to sign up for a Best Buy Credit Card. As if they weren't struggling enough as it is. I understand that I'm located inside of a store and so selling a service is what we do, but to charge $149.99 dollars for a Virus Removal to someone and expect them to pay that kind of money on a 4-year-old Computer then tell them if they don't sign up for a Best Buy Credit card then they're out of luck is just unfathomable. And then your ridiculed by your superiors because you didn't get a sale for a $199, $249, $329 membership with geeksquad."
good,Your work day is a lot easier when you have a good staff to work with. In the 7 years of working for this company I've leaned a lot about working in a warehouse.
good,"I started in best buy as a sales consultant, It is a good first job but really not the best scenery. Too much little drama and management is has so much responsibility on you but get paid starting 10$. Responsible for closing the store and downstocking, truck nights..ect. Be friends with the management then you possibly get ahead."
good,"It's a typical retail part time job. High turnover rates and seasonal over hiring will gurantee that your coworkers will change almost as often as product changes location in the store. All that aside, it has air conditioning, and very thorough policies and rules, and if you are on good terms with the managers things tend to go smoothly. Also the Discount is AMAZING."
good,Great company! The specific store that I worked in was very messy. The management changed often and really had no structure. I enjoyed the company policies and the benefits were sensational.
good,Best Buy general only wants 1 thing. To hit sales goals. Many of their employees are severely underpaid and are unhappy.
good,"This job would not be something I recommend for a career. I understand it is retail and they are a high demand company. There is no consistency with scheduling, which make it hard to plan life. Get to know some very interesting people but reminded me of being in school all over again. Very low chance of moving up."
good,I liked  Best buy because i dealt with phones and computers which are my passion. To me I loved helping customers find the right solution to an issue. The work place was diverse i like that alot
good,"There was never any room for advancement, based on all employees working there. The only fulltime people there were management. Everybody was part-time never getting more than 20hrs per week."
good,"There is very little advancement opportunities if you are a woman and Geek Squad in general is a male dominated department. The management quality varies by store and the company is always restructuring. It is a great place to network and move on to other bigger, better things."
good,"I enjoyed my work for Geek Squad, I did not, however, enjoy working for Best Buy. I loved doing the job, repairing computers, but dealing with management who were more interested in doing what was best for the business, and not the clients. Time and time again, people who would complain loud enough, about things that weren't even important would get what they wanted, yet people who followed the rules, and guidelines got nothing in return, which is the core issue at places like this. Financial compensation is also much lower than industry average for most positions, especially those who work in the geek squad."
good,I would recommend this job if you like electronics. Management was not great. Customers were very needed and have to be able to keep calm.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Benefits are ok, discount is the best part.  Management is always pushing you to attach garbage that the customer doesn't need.  Claims they care about customer service, but they really just want profit.  Wouldn't be surprised if they were out of business in a few years honestly."
good,"Having fun while being the best"""
good,"The mood set at best buy all begins with the manager beginning the day. Unfortunately, depending on who the individual is the day goes based of their feelings, for example if they woke up in a bad mood or are having a rough day, it is often showed and taken out on employees, other times the day could be going great. Overall Best Buy is a rollercoaster...never consistent."
good,Just expect to work when ever they say and then get talked to like a child because your not the boss. No matter what you do all day if your not in with the in crowd you end up doing more than your fair share of work
good,Started off as a good place to work until they started pushing products that had little to do with the rest of the store.  Management not effective in communicating objectives.
good,"I was with Best Buy for over 8 years doing multiple rolls, the best position I held was for merchandising specialist and project team specialist. The coworkers were the best part of the job and not having a fixed schedule was the worst."
good,"Very very  poor  work  morale  no  communitcation  between  management Team and  Store staff. Cutting back on work hours."
good,"Though you may have new technology available to you with great big discount, they pay is not worth to time spent. The culture is easy to follow and its a fun environment with the right leadership. High turn over rate."
good,Best Buy is a good stepping stone to a better job. Try not to spend a  lot of time in one position. Over all not a bad place to work.
good,has its ups and downs but this store has some of the worst mangers  i have ever seen working for best buy i have worked for many different best buys they have been great but this one is the worst there is
good,Discounts are good.  Very relaxed work place. Company expects associates to be top sales people but does not compensate for expectations.  Pay and bonuses are terrible.  Management lacks direction and communication skills.
good,Very basic and hard to move forward environment. Due to it being retail there is little consideration to the employee's personal needs.
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for. The biggest value that has been instilled in me and will forever stick with me is having fun while being the best. Best Buy is constantly changing and evolving to stay ahead of the times and prides itself in providing the best Customer Service. I have and always will recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,"Employees were a fun bunch, but there was some isusses to why I left, first was that I did not get paid over time working 14 hours overnight when I was schedualed to work 6 hours, and second was that some management did not treat employees in a way that could have been treated differntly. I felt that it was alot of work and not enough people and sometimes to a point that became painful. "
good,"Operated cash register, Customer support, helping customers by addressing there needs, answered questions from and"
good,The duties of resolving customer's issues or being of assistance to their inquiries about a particular item. Daily notate accounts and what I did to personally assist the customer.
good,"My first year at the company was great, but eventually management was totally replaced....actually twice.  Corporate likes to cycle through management at Best Buy firing them for pretty much anything.  It got to the point where I had completely new management that scoffed at Geek Squad and didn't appreciate us at all.  They made so many budget cuts that it was eventually just ONE agent scheduled at a time for an absolutely insane amount of work.  My job ended up being me apologizing to customers for the last couple months.  I had to explain that our management was too incompetent to schedule more than a single employee to work on 30+ computers, do all the shipments, answer all the phone calls, do all the screen installs, do all phone claims, run the register, do GSP returns, and run the front counter for each and every shift.  Any company that thinks a single employee can handle that much work is absolutely insane, and that is why I left.  The job used to be manageable but our new management was more concerned about how staffing hours looked on paper at a corporate level than the service we provided to our customers."
good,"When first starting at Best Buy, I loved the job. Environment was friendly & fun. After a while, management began to change, started feeling like going to work was a chore, very rude leadership, just didnt make you feel welcomed anymore."
good,"O dia de trabalho e as horas eram gratificantes, aprendi muito sobre os mecanismos de vendas e como funciona uma agência de viagens. "
good,"Typical Day: Every day offered new challenges that made the day that much more exciting."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I really enjoyed the work I did. Helping client find the right products in the store and helping them with any technical issues they came across. Repairing clients computers, removing viruses and figuring out a variety of OS issues was very rewarding and what I really enjoy doing. That being said, the entire corporation is poorly managed. We do not have enough labor to cover the large amount of work we have to do. They consistently put more work and responsibility, deserving of a promotion, on myself and co-workers without any kind of compensation. When there are positions open in the store, employees are not made aware. They pull from outside the store or company to fill those positions."
good,"You'll work very hard. Lots of rewards but they're also quick to change course. If you want a slow moving company, don't work here. If you like having a job where things evolve and change on a dime - this is your spot."
good,The team leads there was a bunch of adults bullies.. not really open to change.
good,"The typical work day was I'd come in early before the store opened and i'd have 30-40 computers and/or laptops to begin working with. I'd have to move quickly and make sure they were all running some sort of diagnostic tool all at the same time. I would have to spend roughly 3-6 minutes making the  call on what the computer needed and then move onto the next one. I'd skip over computers I deemed that needed to be fine tuned and no diagnostic tool would really be helpful. These computers I'd start working on when I had finished getting all the other computers going. "
good,Worked in a fast-paced environment helping customers research and purchase desired items. Assisted in the management of the department budget. Handled numerous monetary transactions daily.
good,"Summary says it all. Although this is a position where you deal with business clientele, rather than the general consumer, it is still a retail position at Best Buy. During my time working at Best Buy, the culture shifted from providing the best experience during each customer interaction to focusing solely on numbers. I loved my customers, but hated the management style of the staff as well as the culture shift for the worse."
good,"I stated on Mission Control a year ago, a typical day in the GeekSquad environment made a very good place to work, a typical day involved offline activities as well as taking calls acting as sales and first line support for domestic tech support issues, troubleshooting British Gas Safe and Secure and Remote Central Heating systems as well as working as phone repairs for Carphone Warehouse. "
good,Sales.  Learned about what you are selling on daily basis.  Management was poor and never on time with any answers and always had to email five or six times to get through.  Co-workers were amazing.  Most enjoyable part helping a customer and making sure they left happy and returned for future purchases.
good,"Most of the employees that were department specific, which is the majority of them, knew what they were talking about in their department (Appliances, Media, Computers, Home Theater… etc). In fact most could recite the features that were listed on the yellow takes verbatim and then tell you everything else you need to know out of their own knowledge on the product.  Best Buy trained their employees on product info extensively, we actually had to get certified on product info before we could sell the product. So basically most people that work at best buy know what they are talking about."
good,as long as you have management on your side its an alright place to work
good,"Best Buy has a lot of room for improvement. The culture and values are meant to build unity within Best Buy but the fundamentals actually do the opposite. Management seems to abuse their power by putting off their work on others below them. There is no accountability held for anyone and their own duties. Every other job besides selling (such as downstocking, pricing, planograms, ect.) gets put on the sales support team (warehouse) even though those jobs are supposed to be done by sales team. It becomes very frustrating."
good,Trying to get customers to purchase cell phones all day long. Most time we have to ask 3 or 4 times. 
good,"Em um dia tipico pouca informação ao funcionários, encontra pouca responsabilidade com clientes. O funcionário tem que responsabilizar por coisas que a empresa, é que tem responsabilidade."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for if you are in highschool or finishing up the university, but unfortunately for those who want to make a living out of this is almost impossible. During my time at best buy i have learned so much about costumer service and how bad management can be. From all this i have learned the things good management should do and how how a real learder should treat their employees."
good,"worked with my family for many years, and my aunt owned the company. she cheated on my uncle and they got a divorced so the business ended."
good,"Geek Squad was an originally separate entity away from Best Buy. However over the years (and after the buyout) Geek Squad merged into Best Buy's premier service. Everything was sold with a Geek Squad Black Tie protection plan and offered to be installed by a Geek Squad agent. The original job description of fixing computers was thrown out the window. Management wanted agents to sell and be out on the sales floor instead of working on client computers. This was not a good decision as some agents were not salesmen and it showed. However, it did not matter for upper management which is why I left."
good,The abundance of policy and structure changes made the workplace less efficient and gave poor supervisors to many opportunities to micro-manage and drag down the staff instead of molding the staff into productive and exceptional employees. All these experiences teach bad habits to future management and supervisory staff not yet in these types of positions.
good,"Not a career type job. no advancement at all, no matter how much or a customer re pore you create."
good,Busy place to work time went by fast loved black friday and the holidays. Hardest part being on my feet all day
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"managment simply doesn't care for the employess, only for reaching set goals for sales."
good,"The days when we were very busy, we had a lot of fun and the energy was very high. Made a lot of friends."
good,"Best Buy was enjoyable for the most part, however challenging economic times have made it extremely difficult to achieve a decent work life balance. The management was inconsistent and the goals were often unattainable."
good,Each day is particular to a general weekly rotation of activities that need to be done.
good,"At first, job was great. Fun, kicked back and had great rapport with all employees including management. Later, with some new management in place, job became more of a chore than something enjoyable to do and get paid for. Management began promoting based on the ""buddy system"". If a person was not buddy's with a member of management, they did not get promoted. Management began tearing down many employees without taking the time to build them back up. Many missed opportunities for several staff members became too much and in August of 2011, about 30-35 sales associates left the employ of Best Buy in Billings, Mt, of their own free will, to find better opportunities. Since that time, several staff members who were buddies with management and had been promoted have since either been asked to step down or have been fired for various infringements such as Time Clock Fraud. The store manager who was employed there during all of this has also been asked to leave the employ of Best Buy all together. There really is no upside to working at this place if one wishes to ever move forward with their career."
good,working at best buy is very simplistic and similar to high school. Personal problems are always in the open air can will eventually affect your working habits.Managers and supervisors are going in and out due to low performance in sales or just interior theft.Advancement in this company is all a bonafide popularity contest.
good,I have worked for best buy for the past five and half years and I will admit it has helped me grow into a better person and has given me opportunities that most companies wouldn't be able to. But the company has lost its way completely Best Buy used to put the customer and employees first and that is not longer the case. The management now only cares about their bonuses and the bottom line as opposed to the advancement of their employees and are only interested in selling the customer what makes them the most money and not what the customer wants or needs.
good,you may move up slowly but the knowledge you gain is for a lifetime
good,The job was a very easy job. Management at the store i was at was a little off; a lot of a favoritism that goes on it the work place. I would recommend this place as a starting job for teenagers
good,Overall.. the other associates were awesome.  They made it a great place to work.  One of the assistant managers at the time definitely tried to make things difficult for me. Put me in a department I knew nothing about
good,"Bad hours, bad pay, and customers.  The trifecta of horribleness.  Ever changing management and a constant sense of impeding doom about the future of the company all lead to a tense and unpleasant work experience."
good,good if you dont mind wondering if youll have a job each month because of what shift youre place on and who says yes to a credit application or a protection plan on every item sold
good,"Nada para destacar ni criticar , son demasiadas horas, 16 para ser exactos"
good,"Management was fine, coworkers were difficult to work with at times, the actual work wasn't difficult. Its mainly just heavy lifting and building/moving pallets."
good,"Best Buy is a place for individuals looking to build a resume for future opportunities. "
good,"I didn’t enjoy working here. You repeat the same exact thing over and over again daily. You don’t get to learn anything new, the managers are never there to help you out, and not worth the pay. The staff is full of teens who don’t take the job seriously so there’s often issues between coworkers/managers making it an uncomfortable place to work. No bonuses, no Paid time off."
good,"It was kinda sucky but I needed a job, long days on your feet but I've done worse. Discount sucked too. Good for students or people into all the tech."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked at bestbuy edmonton north for 2 years and was randomly let go mid holiday season with no other options but to wait for winter to end to find work, i got a raise monday and got let go friday, no one not even the hr manager would tell me why."
good,"I'm glad I got out when I did. When I started with the company, sales were not as important as they are now. They have started making employees try to sell more and more while creating pointless/childish phrases to trick people into spending more money. They need to take a hard look at the culture that they are generating."
good,"If you don’t fit their mold you’re their enemy, even if you exceed expectations in your work. “Managers” tend to be abusive and selfish, and if you’re not a favorite or a friend, they will make you feel worthless  it doesn’t matter if you bring them to achievers (the yearly company wide sales competition)"
good,I’m sure it’s different at other locations but Best Buy expects a little too much for the pay. The schedules are all over the place and they constantly redo the company’s structure making it hard for you to get the position you want
good,"I enjoyed learning about the products, and hearing peoples opinions on brands. Whenever venders came in I loved talking to them so I can learn more details of the brand history and specific products they like, information I carried to customers. I excelled at adding protection plans, and explaining how the devices worked to the customers so they better understood their purchase and why the protection plans were important. Said venders usually appreciated not only having someone to talk to about their products, but usually have something to tell me that the Best Buys training videos never even mentioned that I believe sells better."
good,Days are however long you make them. Meaning you finish the work you go home when it’s done. Not to bad of a job. Usually about a 8 hour day. Hours are from like 8 to  around 3
good,Not really a place if you wish to grow at all. It all depends on management as to who likes you or not. No overtime and most of the time doing three jobs for one person.
good,Great side job or job while going to school. Career advancement is possible but a lot of politics really factor in for that. Overall good experience. Would recommend if looking for a different retail experience.
good,"Their sales training was very valuable and I still use it today in everyday interaction, but it is NOT worth it to stay there unless you want to elevate to management.    "
good,"At first the job was straight forward depending on what you were assigned to do. And then about 6 months in it just started to change rapidly and now I feel like I am not working the same job that I originally applied for or was hired to do. Its insanely stressful and it is not fun at all even though one of the values of Best Buy is to ""Have Fun"""
good,"They try to build you into management if you have brain. The problem lies with going any where in the company. No matter how many problems you solve, how hard you work and give up your life to advance there is none. It take years to get into a higher position and if you do get higher you stay their for many more years. You can't really have a mind of your own or way of doing things. Management will put you down before they would consider bring you up. Negative and childish place to work."
good,"The company offered no type of benefits, very little chance for advancement, and the intro management turned a non-commission based position into a cut throat, competitive, hostile environment. Poor leadership is desired by the brass."
good,Working at Bestbuy is a great experience to work at because there is never a day that it’s the same. Other employees are great to work with!! Work hard and you’ll make it to your goal in and out of work.
good,Poor management and leveraging of talent. Customers can be the worst portion of the job. Month to month metrics are more punishing than rewarding. Incentives are too low.
good,Working at BestBuy doesn't feel like a job but more of a lifestyle. You get paid to talk with everyday people about technology. You help customers find what they're looking for. The goals and targets you have to reach are hard to hit since not EVERY customer you talk to will spend over $1000.
good,"It is ok as a job.Not a good idea for a career.  Also has nepotism problems. Many things are not equal for employees. They fail to update pay, There are people who have worked for the company for 10 plus years that make less than a teen in high school ,that they just hired."
good,Department managers are nice to work with however the general manager cares nothing more than making the company money. He verycommonly would deny time off and availability changes even though these were very common with his college aged work force. As well very low pay.
good,"My particular team was amazing, but this was during the days of Best Buy Mobile when stand-alone stores still existed. I've heard nothing but horror stories about management and workplace culture at big-box stores."
good,"This was one of those jobs that you were just a body, a number on the list.  You needed to 'brown-nose' with the right people to truly make it anywhere in the company.  The term 'good ol' boy' network was definitely in place here, up to and including discriminatory acts pertaining to members of the military/veterans and when confronted there was no support."
good,You get make decisions for yourself and your customers. Little help from management. Not a lot of room for growth. It would get boring a lot. We had at least two meetings daily.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Didn't get much out of this job. People were okay and somewhat friendly and they rarely asked you if you felt good or comfortable. They kind of just throw you out there
good,When workers all in the same department have an issue with a manager its something to listen to but the manager in charge of the store didnt bother to listen causing more than half of the department to leave little pay and the job in the beginning was good but no one listens to the little people that matter
good,"my co workers were decent but management was all over the place. They had unrealistic revenue goals, and hounded you each day to get financial services even if it was completely dead in the store. I never received a raise after two years of working there, I never called out and always showed up 15min early. The white shirt (new employees) made more than me in some instances. its dog eat dog."
good,Be prepared to do your job and someone gets the credit. Management never helps when you have a question and people always talk about you even though you dont even know them.
good,Management is rude and you have to kiss a** to move up. PTO is awesome and during the week the store is empty so you’re just relaxing on your shift. Hard to get holidays off
good,"Personally, I do not enjoy this job, mostly because of the workplace culture. There is a lot of swearing from other employees and everything is about the bottom line, which is getting people to sign up for a credit card and selling as much as possible. I don't find these things very motivating. I enjoy having fun conversations with customers, and I think that the company has good systems in place to care for employees, like benefits for full-time employees and also PTO for part-timers. If you are a salesperson, and don't mind a little swearing and crude humor, this is could be a good job for a season! Just not a good fit for me as I am not a sales person and don't enjoy being around swearing employees."
good,Have little care for employees with cronic health issues. Limited opportunities for seasoned professionals. Good overall environment for individuals. Needs to update pay structure.
good,Company seems to be looking for ways to tighten their belt and of course it starts with the store level first before they cut any of their pay. Company just feels like its changing directions again.
good,"They never scheduled enough people for a shift. A single person such as myself mainly ran the entire back warehouse for most of the day. Single individual expected to load/unload large trucks while simultaneously picking online orders in 15 mins or less as well as answer item stock questions for the sales team, pull items, bring them to the front and load them in the customer's car as well as process any drop shipments."
good,"Coworkers aren’t the best, it could get better if you could trust and depend on your coworkers but they’re pretty lazy and undetermined to get the job done"
good,"Best buy is a good place to work overall if you dont plan on doing anything outside of work."
good,"the job and customers are fine, its fast paced work but helping customers makes it worth it. the managers aren't very helpful. work place culture is slightly juvenile"
good,"Overall Best Buy was not a 'bad' place to work. It was a paying job."
good,"It was a great experience. I had some great co workers who helped me and guide me throughout my growth. Some day we’re difficult with customer, but my co workers helped me get through it."
good,"After more than 10 years with this company I have to say that I do have some fond memories.  At the same time, the management teams are hit or miss on following the companies mission statement.  Every store is doing something slightly different which can lead to confused employees.  My suggestion is to work here while your in college, than move onto something that you can make a career out of."
good,good environment to work in. Great coworkers but favoritism with management. I love talking to the different customers and engaging with every new customer.
good,this is not the place if you have a lot going on outside that you have to plan for. Dose not consider school as an important element of life when it comes to reasoning for taking off.
good,They have us work ridiculous hours and the pay is not at all the best. The best part of this job are the coworkers. For the most part it would be a great job. It just depends on your manager and favoritism in the workplace.
good,put me in warehouse after two weeks of training. then shortened my hours to about 6 hours a week. In my first week sold tons of computer with my trainer but apparently manager didn't like how I was selling them wanted me to stick to a scripted sales pitch.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I believe that this is a great start off point for people interested in remaining in the retail environment . I would def suggest this place to someone looking for a position in retail/sales.
good,"Best Buy was one of the first jobs I had after high school. I liked working there for the coworkers, however, management was very strict and the sales goals were hard to attain given how slow our store was."
good,"Ok place to work. More so a job and not career, I would def suggest that you attend some form of college while working here. The pay however wasn't to bad, raises every year."
good,"Non stop, always on your feet, and have to deal with rude customers. They would work with your schedule if need be. There are no benefits for for part time employees only for full time."
good,Didn't like working for this company.  Not flexible. Sales goals driven. Had to make cold calls and was threatened by management that if sales goals weren't met you would be fired.
good,"Best Buy is sectioned off by two principles, productivity and revenue per hour. If you work warehouse your expected to be productive and if your in sales it does not matter how productive you are as long as your making revenue. I worked at Best Buy for a little over four years now and I have to say that I never seen a workplace so divided and at each others throats. This is not to say all Best Buy's are like this but Operations and Sales do not get along at my location. This is a good place of employment as far as the discount but I would not consider Inventory or Merchandising a long term gig. While managing a whole department most times by yourself you have to control online orders, shipping and receiving, phone calls from other stores and various requests for other departments on the ""Revenue"" team. Although the pay is competitive you have to ask is 12 dollars a hour really worth the amount of stress each day."
good,I have nothing to say about the company it is a job but it has very little chance and or possibility for advancement in the company other then that i have not much more to say
good,The job itself was ok . You could come into work some days with a clear plan laid out for the work that you needed to complete by the end of your shift. Or some days you could come into no plan and your job was to be available and make sure you pick online orders and check inventory for any calls made to the back for items not found on the floor. You would also be responsible for walking the and helping customers.
good,"somewhat competitive."
good,I worked in the warehouse for about 4 years. I liked working there but the issue was our GM. I felt like we were treated unfairly and the stress from our GM caused our OM and supervisor to stress even more.
good,A typical day at work consisted of meting sales quotas and credit card applications. There was a micromanagement system. The work culture was competitive to say the least.
good,Typical retail store. Learned a lot about phones. Blackfridays are the worst. Closing duties are a pain. New mobile manager is power hungry. Very competitive and a manager is always on you.
good,Bad company no growth or good pay employees stay at the bottom even if they worked they for over  5 to 10 y ea are  . I need a better company with great pay and benefits
good,"Mandatory 3 months no time off between november to january, they were more in it for the money then the people working for them or shopping there, best example of this there was a guy that worked there for 10 years was friends with everyone and when he died the GM wouldn't leave to go to the funeral cause the store was busy or let anyone else go either."
good,"Ask for a lot of your time for little pay, you make the store all the money while the higher-ups get the most benefit from doing the least amount of work."
good,Not the place to start a career but it might be a nice lateral move if you work for a giant retail company like home depot or something. Turnover is insanely high and they really don't pay enough for what they expect in terms of performance! - Again not a bad place to start and the discounts are nice!
good,"Everyone has a good place and a not so much place, Best Buy may have changed in the four years I have parted with the company, but the over all experience was okay. I don't recommend it to people who want an extensive career in technology, this is retail and that is the only focus you will have, is sales. There is more to life than being in the top 5% of sales. "
good,"Fast paste environment ,in even more tech savy environment.I learned a lot about people and different personalities and als picked up good sales skills."
good,"I was told I was being hired on for the Black Friday rush through February where I'd be given the the opportunity of an extension with good performance. However, after New Years, they just told me they'll contact me with my new schedule, and never did. I called a few times and was told it may take a week or two. I eventually ended up showing up on-site to be told they didn't need anymore help. I wouldn't have minded this if I was just told to me upfront. I wasn't the only one this happened to by far. I found it all very unprofessional.  My first 3 shifts were during the busiest time of the year. I'd only had about a few hours of training and I was expected to direct customers to every individual item in the store and also answer questions about nearly item. I was also called to work on the register with  only about 20 minutes prep that didn't include hands-on training. I learned fast, but apparently not fast enough, even  though I rarely got negative feedback."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I don't have anything to say, this company is poorly ran an is a joke since they restructure every year to save money vs eliminating idiots at the corporate office"
good,"Working for Best Buy was productive. Lots of work to do, management was decent. I had to quit Best Buy due to unknown medical issues at the time. I would have stayed longer if it weren't due to medical issues."
good,is not the place you want to stay unless your trying to become management good job for high school students trying to transition into the wok field and good job for people who love electronics
good,"A typical day starts by showing up, clocking in and completing what is known as a "" check in"" you meet with your manager and they go over the stores performance in proportion to your own personal performance as in your, sales numbers, the amount of extended warranties you sell and how many customers you cohered Into applying for the "" Best Buy credit card"". Every check-in went about the same it was something along the lines of "" here is how much money you have brought into the store, now here is how much money we as managers think you should be bringing in"". Then you go to your department and assist customers. I learned about home audio equipment, the best speakers go with the best receiver and things like that. I learned how to not only talk to people but to listen and understand their issues and help find what I call ""A-Z solutions"". Which just means I worked with the customer methodically to get them the best product for them. The break down of management was pretty simple, there are 6 managers all in charge of different parts of the store, issues arose when one manager mainly the sales manager who is also my direct manager would make judgement calls regardless of input from his colleagues on things like how many hours should be allotted for labor in any department or when it was acceptable to branch off from my own department to help others. The hardest part of the job was being threatened with termination every time the sales manager felt slighted or when you are not performing exactly how he expects. It was also difficult to come to terns with the fact that the company"
good,"if you don't mind asking every customer if they want a credit card then this place is for you, thats all they care about."
good,To many people want to be the boss and no one wants to follow. lack of team work. Too many bosses and lack of trust from management. Even with good reviews from clients if your supervisor sees you as a threat to his/her position you will not last or advance in your position.
good,It's an alright place to work at with an excellent employee discount. You will find people from all walks of life there along with a few very negative detractors
good,I used this position as a temporary platform into the world of Information technology.  Retail is never a good option for a single parent with stressful hours and schedules.
good,"I learned a lot at Best Buy but the way they did things there for their employees were not the best, at all. There was favoritism all throughout the store."
good,The work schedules do not work out if you have a family. 
good,"If Bestbuy was an animal it would be a tortoise crossing the highway of innovation, it's going so slow you're not even sure its going anywhere anymore."
good,"Some days during the week, its super dead and we'll literally downstock all day. During the weekend, its packed and it's all hands on deck. Each store is different, some stores hardly have any female management. Which makes it difficult to move up, some managers are only there for a paycheck, and make it virtually impossible to give you useful knowledge on how to move up without saying it will take years.. when you've already worked for the company for almost three years."
good,"Working was at times pleasant, assisting customers find the right product that fits their needs was satisfying. I also worked at customer service making sure customers were happy."
good,"In some stores you can tell who the favorite people are and women are treated differently, some as if they are incompetent and don't deserve jobs they are applying for.   If they are girly girls and your typical female they get more opportunities.  They lack paying individuals what they deserve and work some people to the bone.  High employee turn over."
good,best buy gives you training but most of it is just videos. you will not have a consistent or good schedule. you do not get sick days or vacation. but its a job.
good,Was told that travel was reimbursed but when actually hired found out that you had to meet X to qualify. This ended up meaning that 80-90% of the time its all out of pocket and not reimbursed. in the end I was taking less home even with significant pay increase.
good,"Bosses are awful at their job. Will write you up for anything and everything. Don’t catch any of them in a bad mood or you won’t hear the end of it. Only fun part is your coworkers. When managers and supervisors arent on the floor, the job is very enjoyable"
good,Sales is not easy and it doesn't make it any easier if your managers don't help you learn about what they are having you sell. This is a workplace intended for short-term plans.
good,"wasn't allowed to move up because management didn't want to replace me.  not something you want to hear when looking to advance, however, a good place to start."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It really varies by store location, different places, different people. Management was poor and had no idea of what they were doing. My co-workers were pretty awesome though and made it enjoyable at times. Discounts were pretty awesome on CERTAIN things at times."
good,For a job that was non commission the managers sure were pushy when it came to closing sales. I was boarderline harassed when a customer declined purchasing protection plans or did not want to sign up for a credit card.
good,"Work environment was okay, plenty of managers available for each department. Had plenty of ability to learn transferable skills, and move around within the store."
good,"Experience in a team environment requiring clear, professional and effective communication while recommending products, services, and solutions to others; Handled all aspects of the sale including: customer contracts and warranties, customer payments, cash, and credit card/check transactions. I enjoyed it very much. Hire me again! :-)"
good,System were easy to learn. Definitely could use better training. Employees and managers were enjoyable. I think Best Buy could offer better compensation to the employees.
good,"Lack of cooperation between management and asset protection teams, having our hands tied and cant get our jobs done properly is a tough one."
good,Shifts went by rather quick because it was busy. Management was always a little disorganized not much benefits for part -time employees. Teamwork is a must to work here.
good,"The company is divided when it comes to manage and the management team is not always on the same page. Your manager can break or make your experience within the company."
good,I liked the job at Best Buy however the manager that I had was very odd so I felt I needed to find something better suited for myself. I gave my notice a few weeks into working at the store.
good,Required to know a lot of information about a lot of different products and systems with very minimal pay off. Starting was $10/hr and only went up $0.40 after a year of work.
good,"Nobody knows what to do with new hires. People stood around looking at each other, poor training and poor mentoring. Pay is better than I had anticipated. Other than that, a fun place for young people to work."
good,Large goals and they expect you to hit all these goals when the traffic in the stores are going down due to things like amazon and eBay. Also the pay was not very good and holiday hours are horrible.
good,This job definitely has its pros and cons but more cons than pros. The advancement is literally impossible and they do not treat there employees right as far as store manager and upper manager standpoint. This job is extremely stressful at times and I do not recommend doing this job if you are college student.
good,"The management at Best Buy hardly made you feel like you were a person. The only discussions I ever had with my managers seemed very scripted or canned responses. Even when I was doing the best in my department, the enthusiasm from them didn't seem genuine and they read off their little list of things to go over in our daily review so robotic that I hardly felt like I was working for real people."
good,"It is a very sales focused job, not so much for customer service or satisfaction. I enjoyed working with customers face to face to help with their needs."
good,"management needs improvement, pay is ok. hours are good but be ready to work every thanksgiving as well as christmas. discounts are pretty good as well."
good,"Typical retail job."
good,Worked in the mobile section. Daily duties involved making sure products were always stocked and assisting customers. Closing was the hardest part because sometimes there was just to much to do and one was always doing overtime on work that requires a big team. Fast Paced environment during busy hours and obviously the holidays.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"While Best Buy used to be a great place to work and many of my friends started out as coworkers there, the companies constant changing of policies and procedures, cutting of hours, only hiring outside the company for management positions, and increasing stress of upselling more and more services ruined the entire culture to the point that everyone that had been there for my entire tenure working there for years left within a single year."
good,"I liked the employees, but I hated working at Best Buy. You get paid so low and it gets boring. I remember getting this job as my second job and I was so excited to work here because I thought wearing the blue shirt was always cool. Then I realized how underappreciated you are as an employee. Your managers expect you to hit specific numbers. If you're a cashier you have to get GSP, which is basically selling protection plans to customers. I guess as a part-time job it's cool, but don't expect to get any advancement here unless you truly put in the time."
good,"If you like to be pushed to sell things constantly and get people to sign up for credit cards and greet the same customer over and over until they leave then this is the job for you. You don't make commission but they push you to sell things like you do. Very cheesy place to work, they act like you're doing the world a favor by selling more technology or accessories. Most people there lack the knowledge for the departments they are in and that's mostly on management since they shuffle everyone around due to coverage being the priority. You don't really get to become an expert in the position you're hired in."
good,"The overall company is great. Unfortunately, due to different philosophies I was let go. I have learned amazing and valuable tools over the past ten years."
good,Values in this store are not management does not hold their employees accountable and allow people to be mistreated and discriminated against. Loved the company but just this store has manager that would rather be friends and not a boss
good,The management is horrible but the coworkers and customers make the job better. I would recommend this job to someone who doesn't need this job as a primary source of income.
good,was not a great place to advance into new roles. was a lot of favoritism. It was not fun and always stress full. the store did not care about the employees growth or  improvement
good,"If you get a job here say goodbye to your weekends since youll never see one again, the managers are only worried about how many people you can get to sign up for credit cards and then you never get rewarded for performing well"
good,"If someone doesn't like you, look out. They will talk to the lead and get you kicked out for whatever reason they decide to use. "
good,"When I worked at this job a typical day included coming in and jumping straight into selling products to customers. I did my best to accommodate people for what they needed, yet we were constantly told to sell service plans and installs, because that is how the company really makes their money. The bad part came from all management, who had very little experience. It is a low level job that offers little compensation benefits, if any. I would easily sell over $100k per  week and would get no kick back of any kind, except my measly minimum wage. I was always kept at the brink of part time to full time. That way they wouldn't have to give me benefits or vacation days. This company will use you. If you're a kid or straight out of highschool, it's better than fast food. Other than that, don't try and start a career here."
good,"You will not get proper training here. The job aids themselves say ""if you have a problem with this task, solve it"" instead of saying how to solve issues with paperwork. "
good,Assisting customers with purchases as well as knowing all the facts about the products you are selling. You are there to learn the reasons why customers purchase the products and the necessities they need in order to make the product fully functional.
good,"I honestly don't have anything too great to say about working at this particular Best Buy. The management was unprofessional, played favorites, and it was almost impossible to be promoted if you were just a cashier or in customer service."
good,"no commission, no full time. no benefits. this is how i worked for 6 years at the company. Managment was a boys club. the people that work there are cool there."
good,"big company, very pushy towards customers, managers treat employees like they don't matter, I would not work for them again, did not like selling magazines"
good,It was a decent experience. Management was very disorganized and the pay wasn't great for the amount of sales they expect. The other employees were friendly
good,"Most of my woes are due to me being part time.  I had attempted multiple times to go fulltime however I kept getting passed up."
good,"Havent worked for this company in over 17 years, so I am sure that during the time away this place has changed."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is okay, for a part time. In the warehouse heavy lifting, highly organized requires effort in all aspects. Management is okay, coworkers easy to get along with."
good,Looking for better pay with room for advancement.   It was a fun place to work but it isn't anymore.  I just want to be paid good because i know I'm a good worker and deserve better.
good,"I had a few great managers at Best Buy,  but many more who were terrible. It was great working with those who took pride in there work and would support each other, but there were many other who had the poor mentality of ""its not my job."""
good,good place for young college students who are interested in sales and technology. The company as a whole is really remarkable. I worked with the company for 5 years and I am proud to say I learned a lot.
good,"Its a fun place to work. Management could use some improvement but over all its worth it. The discount is decent, and at our store the pay is quite fair for the work required."
good,"I've always wanted to work for Best Buy and I was able to get a job there during the Christmas season, which was overwhelming, to say the least. I worked extremely hard the only thing that gets me is they only pay you 11.00 per hour, and no commission that hurt because I was selling a lot I would upgrade a customer from 99.00 to 599.99 and they didn't care."
good,"Was an exciting time while i was there.  Most of the job consisted of rearranging and reorganizing products, sometimes restocking was required, generally that was done in the morning however."
good,"-Very Busy"
good,"Its hard to get hours, would need to know some one in there to move up. The only part of the job is the best is the team you work with. Upper management is terrible."
good,"Each day is different, each new client/customer you meet will have a different concern or problem they are experiencing and it is our job as agent to help find the best solution for them."
good,"Best Buy tiene buenas prestaciones, desafortunadamente un ambiente laboral que irrumpe mucho con la vida personal debido a los horarios, una empresa con mucha rotación de personal, falta de crecimiento interno. Mucho aprendizaje, buenos compañeros de trabajo, mucho trabajo en equipo."
good,"i worked  there as temp, the atmosphere was cool, and  i learned some work discipline, i was expecting stay there for long but my temp agency sent ne to another"
good,"Was supposed to be asset protection, ended up being a Walmart door greeter.  Employees see you as the lowest form of life in the store. They will ask you to work truck on a Saturday morning at 6am unless you're an old guy"
good,"Typical work day is formated and standard"
good,"Best Buy is great for a college kid. We work hard, make great customers that come back for us specifically and generally have a good time."
good,"The job is ok, the pay is pretty low. The environment is friendly but the people are not so much. It depends on the place I guess. New people come and go, so its constantly changing. I don't recommend working here for the money, maybe for just fun."
good,I've been with best buy for a year and a half now and I've enjoyed it for the most part. The management at the various stores I have worked at has just been terrible. Corporate needs to reevaluate their leadership.
good,"If you are in high school, go for it. The hours are horrendous and way too unpredictable. Management doesn't really care what you have going on."
good,It was a seasonal job and I was hired in October but then school session started for myself and decide to let it go. The hiring process was good and the employees were nice.
good,"Work/Life balance is good when you are a part time employee."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Coming in at 7a.m. in the morning to start my day. I review emails any notes from previous shift then I get my day started fixing PC's at the Geek Squad. I learned so much over the past 17 years and have taught many what I have learned. We have online trainings that we have to complete every month where we learned about different things within the corperation and new products that are coming out for to sale inside the store. I have no problems with any of my co-workers that I work with. Over years I think I have gotten along with everybody I came in contact with at Best Buy. If for some reason I didn't like you as a person I would still keep it professional. The management is okay but could be better. Most of them have been there for a while and sometimes change is a good thing.The hardest part of my job is dealing with my fellow employees that know how to do there job but for some reason still choose not to do it correctly. and that makes it harder for the next shift coming in after them. What I love most about is that I get to do what I love to do everyday and that is fix computers.
good,"Good , they were on your back a lot. Wanted you to follow people around . Didn't make much sense , pay is good. Need more people"
good,"A typical workday is alright. I had a manager who was hiding watching cameras all day meanwhile my lead was always playing on her phone and never working. I worked harder than alot of my peers and never got appreciated. The few times I wanted a 10 minute break, which everyone is allowed based on business, everyone would say taking another lunch or taking a break why? Uh I don't know because I had a knee injury and occasionally i just need to put them up for a minute. The store I worked at was not accommodating on that. The only good store to work at is the bunkerhill store which rarely has openings because the atmosphere is how geek squad and best buy intended it. Fun and cool place to shop. If you are going to work here it is hit or miss. Hope you get a great manager is the only thing. Elearnings do not really train you on anything they need to do more one on one training instead and inconsistent hours based on store"
good,"You learn a lot at Best Buy. But when management changes, it all changes."
good,"Poor Management. Very little room for advancement. No matter how well you do the job its never good enough. Despite your job being to repair computers you will be expected to be a secretary, and a consultant as well."
good,Great place to start a career but not much room for advancement as a tech. The best part of the job is being able to help someone with their computer and seeing the joy and relief on their face when you are able to fix the problem they have been having for week in a few minutes.
good,Working at Best Buy is a lot like working in a toy store but for adults. being at the helm of new technology as soon as it hits the market is always fun to be a part of. there are sales goal expectations despite there not being commission. management is generally cool enough apart from the occasional jerk. best part of the job is playing with the gadgets. hardest part is moving product yourself if warehouse is busy
good,"I may just be biased and my experience may have been affected by the exact location that I worked in. However, even if someone is just hired for the holidays, it would have been great to have been trained and instructed fully, rather than just hoping the other employees would step up. They had their own job to do, as well."
good,"Company is great to work for, depending on the store. There is no such thing as Job Security there, so you constantly feel on edge about your job. Stress level was CRAZY high for me, and I was there for almost 5 years. The workers that get hired there are so lazy and the management does nothing to them to correct their lazy behaviors. I've witnessed Workers shopping at other stores during work hours on the work computer, Vanish to Starbucks for over an hour while the others are having to bust their butts to get things covered, and other crazy things that should have gotten people fired MONTHS ago. Will never work there again."
good,"working with clients and customers is very active, knowledge is power to provide great customer service, the hardest part is keeping up with all the new technology and most enjoyable is working around all the cool toys"
good,I currently work here as a delivery driver. They hire too many people you will barely get hours.  Some of the employees are very nice but some of the others just have no idea what they are selling so it hurts you in the long run when you bring the product in the house . Everything is always your fault .
good,its an alright work place. good if you enjoy the electronics aspect of it. managers have a lot of favoritism. great discounts
good,"Mgmnt sucks. NO chance for actual advancement unless you go out drinking/hanging out with mgmt, no matter how hard you work. Company is awful with politics."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, including my immediate supervisors/managers. Best Buy is just not a great company to work for. We were expected to be salespeople, with the sales quotas and metrics, but were not paid commission. Starting pay is very small and there is little opportunity for advancement. Mandatory store meetings are early in the morning on the weekend. Even if you don't work that day, you are still expected to go to the less-than-an-hour-long meeting."
good,"After being employed with this company for over 1year I've come to love my job and what I did, however recently they've decided that Solar team should be eliminated"
good,Best Buy is a great job for anyone with no life. It is like pulling eye teeth to get a weekend off. The best part of working at Best Buy is the employee discounts. The worst part is having to work every weekend and holidays. It makes it easy to get burned out from seeing all the public coming in and knowing you have to be there every weekend. when they hire you they tell you that anytime you need off just ask. Then after you are there a while they let you know not to ask off a single day from November to Jan.
good,A typical day at work would be to assist customers in getting the best services to meet their needs. Providing approximate diagnosis of computer problems on the counter to help the customer understand what may be involved in repairing the problems and the time frame it would take.
good,"good way to get into technology. it was fun before they started pressuring all of us to sell sell services. no more recognition. they stopped game nights, store parties. started opening on thanksgiving. the discount is the best part of working there."
good,I don't hate the company or the people that I worked with but I had a bad experience with poor management. They designed their work environment based off aesthetics instead of productivity which made for poor work productivity.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Management is too focused on numbers rather than giving ideas on how to raise them. Felt very commission based pressure but not working on commission. Also starting pay was pretty low and managers would hire people with no experience at a higher pay rate than people that had worked there 2+ years.
good,"Overall it was a great first job because I learned a lot, but I quickly realized that retail was not for me.  The environment was very negative and everyone was just waiting for the opportunity to leave."
good,Hate contractors.  Tell sexist jokes.  managers don't care and will not will tell you to keep it a secret if you are being sexually harassed.
good,"Je comprend que l'entreprise doit être rentable mais à mon avis pas au détriment de son investissement au-près du personnel."
good,"Managers are okay. Some are better than others. All that I have worked with seem to have a lack of a desire to show associates how to sell to improve revenue. They're just there to be security guards, walking around or standing in one spot and chat with other managers."
good,"was understaff at the best buy that I worked at. Made it hard to take off when needed. However, I really enjoyed the staff that work there"
good,"Management is worried only about profits. Does not support employees. Employees who work hard get a minimal pay raise after reviews, while manager gets a 6 figure salary."
good,Lied to me about hiring me part time and told me that I was seasonal but overall it was a fun place to work and the co-workers were nice to work with.
good,Great way to learn tech skills and get a great employee discount. Other then that I would move on to other jobs as soon as you qualify.
good,"would pull layaways, put up truck , set up displays, help customers, help set up store, set planograms,set ad, help deliver and install purchases, work other departments, help install car stereos, and check store email."
good,"long hours, especially around the holidays, much shorter hours after the holidays. fast paced and willing to change according to the local consumer. Willing to show off new products and trends."
good,Great company but the environment changes store to store. Great learning experience. Great for getting your foot in the door for sales positions.
good,"the General manager at the store was a very rude and inconsiderate person.harsh working conditions, and advancement and compensation was lacking."
good,I don't think Best Buy as a company can overlook how many employees are disappointed with the lack of accountability with management. They use their employees as guinea pigs to do their dirty work and shows no respect.
good,"My time at best buy was great and would had loved to stay, just the company went through a lot of changes and cut a lot of positions. I had moved up all that I could and hit my cap on pay raise. Was there for 5 years and had a lot of experience knew that store in and out, and having to fight for to hit 10.00."
good,"A typical day is putting stock away, helping customers and fixing price labels.   I have learned a lot about working with the public again.  The management is just okay depending on who you work with.  Certain higher people just care about the company and not how they treat their employees.  Hardest part of the job would have to be lifting the T.V.s all day long.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and certain coworkers."
good,"Very poor management skills"
good,Great vision and always adapting and changing. You get to help people and work together to find solutions. fun environment And learn quite a bit
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"BestBuy is a good company to work for while going to school, but as a career the company is lacking in promise. At face the company seems to be doing well and the employees are all happy; however, this is a facade for most of the workers. Considering what is required of all the workers, as well as, the quota, the pay is insufficient. "
good,"To work for Best Buy as a company is great, working for a store can vary. You can have the most amazing team and support when you have great leaders coaching and pushing you to become better. You also have the flip side where if managers do not care, you are faced with training alone and learning in a tense environment. Your typical day at work begins in the backend of the store where prices are updated and shipments are processed. As the day go forward it can get intense with multiple sales/orders coming through and taking care of your everyday tasks. "
good,Job security was awful. Upper management were loosing their jobs left and right. Co-workers weren't friendly. The pay wasn't what they made it seem.
good,Would be great for part-time work. Just don't try and jump start a career - likely closed within a few years
good,"I love working with a lot of people at Best Buy.  Those who do enjoy working for this company make it easy.  However, it's still just a place for people to go nuts during Black Friday.  If that's your idea of a fulfilling job, by all means."
good,"Although there are company values and morals in place, some of the management crew do not follow them. The surroundings are amazing as well as coworkers but aside from that, the company as a whole does not care about its employees."
good,To many re-organizations and movement. No to little opportunity for advancement.
good,They worked with my schedule so I was able to get off work in time to pick up my son from school.
good,".Management is to busy to recognize a job well done.  Infact they are to busy to even notice the employees.  This makes the employees band together and get along well, most of the time.  And you learn how to be a self starter."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of handling returns and exchanges, problem solving, handling customer concerns and complains as well as answering phones. I learned how to multi- task in a much more productive matter and how to separate my personal life from my professional life. The management was not the best because of the high turn-overs as well as co-workers. But the ones that stayed longer than three months were great to work with, we always tried to work as a team to get the job done right. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to handle very aggressive and angry customers that seem to not be willing to work the employee to find whatever solution could be done at that time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and put a smile on their faces."
good,enjoyed helping customers with the returns and exchanges. Co-workers changed often. The hardest part about the job was the management. They did not care about the employees.
good,Working here had it's ups and downs. The hours were always long and the guests weren't the nicest. Playing with gadgets and listening to music was an up.
good,"I wouldn't recommend this particular best buy in Huntsville, Al to anybody. The management staff flirts and show favoritism to all the young females that they can have on their jock strap! There isn't a sense of business culture about the leadership staff. It's all about how you make them look. The ASM's have been with the company 10-18 years and still don't know half enough business moral to properly manage the company. Regular employees know more company values than long term management. Please don't jump so quick to apply for this job or company cause you shall regret the decision."
good,work/life balance lacks and it is hard to advancement with all of the beauracy
good,"Worked as a computer tech before geek squad."
good,"Okay, management is hard driving and it often feels like the needs of the daily budget are more important than the needs of the customer but that is typically to be expected in a sales environment."
good,Was ok corporate culture was not in line with what they said it was
good,pretty good but management allows others to act out and disrespect others
good,"I loved working for this company, I just wished I had I position with the office or security department instead of the TV Rec area I had.  We had a fabulous cafeteria that served wonderful food at decent prices as well as a great breakroom with computer, televisions, and multiple gaming consoles."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The people i worked with were awesome people they were always fun and happy. I made some new friends and met some awesome customers.
good,"Working for the customer service portion of best buy was as expected: consistent problem solving and usually high-stress confrontation directly with customers who were experiencing difficulty. Great Coworkers, though!"
good,Was hired seasonal so no formal training. Thrown into the fire and expected to learn quick. Not a too bad of a place to work if your quick on your feet but frustrating with being understaffed when most needed and overstaffed when not.
good,I would recommend this position to someone single without a family or much of a social life that enjoys working hands on with electronics.
good,"It was a pretty cool place to work at first; always something to do. Towards the end of my time there, I started noticing some faults in the management and a lot of favoritism. They have a lot to work on as a store."
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee over the Thanksgiving/black friday weeks. Without a warning, I was taken off the schedule. I called and they said they no longer needed me. And that was that."
good,Too many bosses and there are so many requirements that have to be met with each sale or you are written up.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy consists of shipping and receiving products onto the sales floor and constantly making sure that all product is available for customers. I have learned how to communicate well with management, customers, and other co-workers in a professional manner. The most difficult part of my job included unloading trucks and stocking the floor during the holiday season secondary to the amount of products coming into the store at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job is being with my co-workers and having a fun time while working with them."
good,Its a pretty fair place to work but needs organization and better communication skills.
good,Company does not invest time into its employees. opended and closed store. what I learned was how to did stellar customer servive. My co-workers were the best. I loved working for best buy because it was different everyday and the one thing I didnt like was the late night hours I had to work and holiday time was hard.
good,"This company is not a good career choice, unless a person is looking to work in management."
good,Is difficult to work with your family and manage the time on routes. Required to work 10 hours a day no matter how much is sold.
good,"Can't work late, can't work early. Just go and do your scheduled shift. The product you work with is cool. You must be able to sell warranties, either truthfully or not. The hours can be demanding, however they also can be versatile if ask well enough in advance. If you have good management, it could be a great place to work, if not, it can be brutal. Good luck."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the opportunity to be introduced to most of the newest most up to date technological innovations as they come onto the market!
good,"Overall my experience at Best Buy was a bt of a challenge due to the fact that I had recently had a baby. I didnt always feel that management team was fair to certain employees, but it was a learning experience and I learned a lot."
good,"assist customers, attend morning meeting, review the days goals with management, review current offers and promotions."
good,"Starting out at Best Buy is fun if your new to the salesman deal. Hours are long and you do not really get a break unless you work more than 8 hours, then your obligated to have a 30 minute lunch. Management is all about numbers and will do what they have to do to get them up, including breathing down the necks of the employees. Co-workers are usually very helpful but when they have one associate per department, times get tough when handling multiple customers. Work can be fast passed at times and then become slow and trying to stay busy is never an easy task. Your pushed to make sales like your on commission but your only paid hourly."
good,Honestly Geeksquad is a great place to work. However because they are attached to bestbuy it sucks. Basically every precinct has 1 or 2 guys that actually know what they are doing technically. The rest bestbuy shoves in there to sell and this generally makes things very stressful for you if you are the technical guy. You have alot of pressure and the stress just isnt worth it at all. Be very careful of management aswell. They can be the ugly step parent.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Not a good place to look for advancement anymore. Love the company, too many issues with redundancies, illogical procedures and directions to compete in the industry of technology."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"While at Best Buy, we were handcuffed and unable to help customers. Management made lots of demands and changed frequently."
good,A typical day at work is very. My co-workers make everyday interesting. The management is okay. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
good,I enjoyed this job but after Christmas hours kept getting cut due to sales not being where they should be. I personally think this is a place for late teens and younger adults.
good,worked here for 2 years. loved the people and the enviroment. pay was ok but could be better.
good,"The work itself is pretty easy, but that's if you can get through the poor management and don't mind being underpaid compared to similar jobs at other companies. Honestly, the only reason I stayed so long was because there was a lot of really good people there that were super supportive and friendly."
good,"they hire people who just managing customer answers need to truth just manage and try selling , they most you handle without question you are fit to stay"
good,"People are not very friendly, for a new person it can be hard to open up and talk to everybody and the employees aren’t very welcoming. The management is what brings you down the most, they’re not open to suggestion because they have been doing the same things for 20+ years however times and technology change. t’s a good place for a person starting up not for a person looking to grow."
good,"Typical part time job. Nothing to special, it mostly consisted of selling stuff to people and stocking everything up. Cleaning and making sure the department was clean."
good,"It's a dog eat dog world at this Best Buy but you hold your own weight. The customers make the atmosphere good but it's upsell, upsell, upsell so that's the industry."
good,Same thing everyday with in production goals and no real competition or upward promotion within customer service representatives. New big bosses killed. Morale and things went downhill.
good,Exemplary Educational material provided! There are so many opportunities for an individual to grow with the organization. They provide you with an infinite number of resources for education and company growth.
good,"the job was great at first, but when the new general manager came in he wanted me selling things to people they didn't want or need. it wasn't right."
good,Working here wasn’t that bad. Some of the managers did not care which sucked especially when you complained or needed something resolved. However they worked with my class schedule and   gave me most if not all days I requested off. It was a good place to work and make friends.
good,"From my experience it's really been based off of the coworkers you are on a team with. If everyone works together it makes the job straight forward and not so stressful but when others are not so hard working and then you have management constantly on your back it can get frustrating fairly quickly. Speaking of management, most of the people I've dealt with are pretty hard to work with. They set unrealistic expectations of you and micro manage very hard instead of trusting those who can do their job, to do their job. Overall there are ups and downs to the job though. Good benefits especially for it being retail and decent pay for starting in retail. When you do have good coworkers and everyone is taking initiative to do their part then it makes it a fun environment and you can actually focus on doing good on your job versus just trying to pick up others slack. If you've never worked retail or sales before and are fresh out of high school or in college then it's a great place to start despite the variable factors of possibly having good or bad leadership teams."
good,Working in any retail job has it ups and downs. Best Buy is no different. They are going through some changes right now..I feel that on line shopping is hurting the day to day traffic in the store..
good,Working in that enviornment had its ups and downs. There were people super close to you at all time which if they spoke too loudly got to be a little much. Working there overall was a pleasant experience.
good,Good company to use to advance to something better there’s not a lot of growth opportunities within the company. And there’s also not enough benefits.
good,I have no real complaints about the job. Its a great place to learn alot about electronics and great chances for advancement if you make the right moves.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Safety and training are not at issue here. As a seasonal employee trying to get hired on after the peak season it is painfully obviously that safety is not an issue"
good,The overall company is OK but if you let the store use you and multitask then they will always use you to do many things throughout the store. The wage that I was being paid was decent but that was the max wage that they can offer so I would never get a raise if I stayed there after that.
good,"Management only cares about credit cards and blue shirts, not AP. they will sell it to anyone who looked poor when desperate. They don’t appreciate hard working employees and there is huge favoritism, they don’t hold ppl accountable that should be and they will throw u under the bus if there are any issues or incidents especially involving corporate/hr. They only favor those with the most credit cards and will even cut hours if performance isn’t good, which isn’t bad but they don’t provide great training either for ANY POSITION."
good,"Best buy was fine for an hourly job, however not the place you want to stay long term. They cut middle people and eliminate jobs regularly. There is little to no managerial support."
good,"great customer service learning experience, terrible communication and boundaries ! Stable work weeks and pay, minimal problem solving. untrustworthy management in my experience as a young woman."
good,"There was a lot of good chances to learn a lot about the departments worked in and feel more intelligent for customers. Management and HR could not care less about their employees. One poor decision and you can be removed at inopportune times or unable to completely talk with HR to fix any issues, then after removal you can be barred from ever working for the company again. They will use you to get the most out of you, then they will terminate you after you've done the best work you've done all year."
good,Great place to work and learn how to sell products. Culture is awesome between coworkers. Upper management have no clue how to manage people and they seem to always get the promotions
good,"Very competitive scenery. Long hours.they don’t care about their employees, they are about the business, however there is no structure to conduct a successful business."
good,"Te celebran tus aportaciones,  no enseñan. hay disciminacion racial"
good,It is a solid company trying to evolve and be better. The vision at the top just doesn't trickle down to the field due to high pressure to perform and deliver results.
good,"The company is amazing,  but unfortunately some of the people that is in charge are clueless over their employees. Most management show their staff how unimportant they're. The only thing that is great is their benefits and working with coworkers."
good,"Decent pay"
good,"Best buy has a decent workplace culture, but pay isn't as competitive as they say and there are issues with upper management. Most issues within the store could be solved by resolving management issues."
good,"Typical day at work was dealing with irate clients, then management not backing you up when you enforce rules that they themselves set in place. "
good,"Worked here while working on my undergraduate degree, was flexible enough for my school schedule to not conflict with work hours and offered opportunities to work overtime."
good,No job security here. Constant churn. Systems are in disarray. Which is why they need so much IT support. It has a good extra curricular atmosphere. But if your manager is a psychopant...I suggest u look for other opportunities.
good,A typical day consist of price changes in the mornings and then ALOT of planograms. Management is absolutely terrible. They favorite sales floor clearly over operations team. Theres very little room to advanced and at least in my store only favored staff  get moved up. Theres been several fishy things that happen in my store. The job itself is fine its the lack of organization at a corporate level all the way down to store level.
good,"It depends on your manager, lots of favoritism. They could do more for their employees when they work weekends and holidays. My manager of my department will buy us food. I think the general manager should provide more food when working during holidays, as traffic is bad, hard to get food in 30mins or less during holidays. I think the pay could be much better. I think raises should be given on employee basis not store production."
good,"Working as an in home agent with responsibilities such as operating power tools in clients homes, knowing ins and outs of computers, security systems and home theatre setups, and operating a company vehicle is a lot to ask for $16.25."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Had a lot of fun times with the people and customer but the pay wasn't really there. Constantly being told to push certain memberships even though the customer didn't really want it.
good,"3 years ago I would have written that it was the best job I’ve ever had. New CEO, new management. Bad changes. The managers are clueless and push this out of touch sales techniques that are not customer friendly at all. Employees call out too much and the drama is 12/10 bad. And don’t work too hard or they’ll promote you to a lead and then eliminate your position and say “you can apply for other spots” but don’t make an effort to keep you after 5 years of hard work"
good,I was hired as seasonal and I was lucky to get hired permanently. I was at 40 hours weekly but new manager that only liked it when pretty girls threw themselves at him got most of the hours and everyone else had their hours cut.  At one point I only worked 8 hours a week.  There's so much favoritism it's sad. They like to cut hours until they push you out of the company
good,Average customer service job. Advancement is based on seniority majority of the time. Management has incentives to produce revenue for the store so that always comes first.
good,"I had more good experiences than bad in my time with Best Buy. I made some good friends, had some great customers, and the discount was always a plus. However I feel there was little room to advance. Though I was promoted here and there it was never at the rate I thought I would be based on my performance/attendance/attitude. During my last two year I didn’t receive annual review. When I finally complained a lot I got a fair review accompanied by a $.13 an hour raise. At that point it was time for me to part ways. I feel like I threw away a lot of years to a company that doesn’t regard (or pay) loyalty. I wish them the best(no pun intended) and will probably smile a little when big box stores become redundant."
good,"Days involve attending to customer needs, and attaching products to sales. Business comes in waves so you will need to find things to keep you busy during the downtime. Management varies by position and location but most know what needs to be done and will delegate as needed. Be prepared to hear about numbers day in and day out."
good,Being around technology is fun and you’re always being trained on new electronics for your department  but management was annoying. I always find job that require you to sign up customers for the companies credit card quite bothersome and best buy is big on that
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you are a student in need of a job or seeking first job employment "
good,"Not one of my favorite jobs due to the fact that I wasn't able to secure enough hours to make a decent living. But for the time being, it was an okay job until it couldn't fulfill my need to pay my bills."
good,"I enjoyed working with Bestbuy at various locations, and learned so much from different leaders. very enthusiasm culture at best buy always about top class smart technologies available to make our lives easier. Not to forget that Blue shirt always there to help you."
good,It is a fun place to work as a teenager or young adult but offers very little career advancement options. Overall didnt really like working there but the co workers were exceptional
good,"You’re only as good as your numbers here, which can be extremely demoralizing given that there are a number of things outside of your control when working retail. The benefits are nice, but the toll working here takes on your physical and mental health probably isn’t worth it. The type of customers you encounter can make or break your day, and if you have low self-esteem the rude ones can destroy your self confidence."
good,"Was blessed enough to meet a ton of amazing coworkers but overall management unorganized. Seems to be toxic underbelly culture of Misogyny, multiple experiences of and witnessing women being sexually harassed or coerced with power/position. Was much  better managed before they cut supervisor positions"
good,"Besides differences between I and the general manager, the break room was nice with vending machines. 30 minute break and two 15 minute ones if you are free! "
good,"Worked there 3 years, went from full time to part time, back to full time, back to part time, back to full time, back to part time. In that order exactly. So i quit, they manage staff poorly."
good,"Best Buy is one of those places that you works seasonally and then they build you up like you're doing fantastic, you think you'll stay and.... Goodbye!"
good,"Overall a great place to work while in school, also providing essential skills. Very little room for advancement unless you know the right people. Work can be biased, raises can be biased, and managers play favorites. Get in, get out, there are bigger and better jobs out there for sure."
good,"Demonstrating computer usage is ok, tutoring or teaching is fine.  Best Buys' Cell Phone processes are highly stressful and hard to manage.  If you have a good manager the job is bearable."
good,"Low pay and long hours. Regardless if zero people walked into the store it was our fault for not hitting unrealistic and unfeasible quotas, especially during off seasons"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"if a best buy if hiring for a bunch of full time positions, RUN. Because everyone who isn't trash is gone now. It can be a fun job that's both collaborative and competitive, but it can also be a nightmare of petty, useless managers who don't know how to do their jobs. I would avoid 422, 423, and 1437 in particular."
good,"Could have been better if management was not the way that they are. I learned how to talk more, workplace culture was alright. You had those employees that did not want to work, employees that complained, etc."
good,I didn't like management its okay for part time I didn't really like cause the way I treated its oaky like said for part I like amazon better treatment
good,Best Buy as a company has a good culture but your experience there is determined by you as well as the leadership above you  I had some great years and I had some years I was run into the ground because of the laziness and alliances made in senior management from the Gm level up to district and market managers.
good,"It's a giant Boys and Girls Club, very clique-like. If you are not with the In crowd then you're not getting the perks of the company. They want sales from you but give you a poor schedule to get sales in... and then wonder why your sales don't go up. It's quite the situation."
good,I used to enjoy working at Bestbuy until our new General manager made working there insufferable. Constant micromanaging and distrust of employees and other managers leading to a hostile environment to work in.
good,"If you enjoy getting talked down to by customers who think they know everything,  this is your go to job. There were alot of high school kids so drama was a constant. No one showed up for work. The pay was bad, and holidays were madness."
good,"While working at Geek Squad I spent more time fixing issues that the guys in the back caused repairing the clients devices than anything else. If you know what your doing or have certs, do not expect much from management. Promotions are based on the ""good-old-boys"" system. If you want to learn, you are better off watching YouTube videos."
good,"Some great staff, though the majority of the staff was there to just earn a paycheck.  I found it most frustrating that most did not imbue a sense of work ethic, and we had to continually cajole them to complete our daily duties. "
good,I found the management to be pretentious and not very willing to help you learn your roll or advance your position. The store itself had a very unfriendly vibe all around. Training was definitely lacking.
good,"They werent to bad to work for raises suck HR is a joke and manigment on the store level couldnt find the ground with healp."
good,"A Typical work day would be very hectic with a little bit of guidance from Supervisors but little to no help when dealing with 15 customers who came in every day."
good,"Job itself was fairly straight forward, managements inability to have a defined idea of what it was doing lead to a constant reorganization of both physical store and duties per section."
good,Stressful work environment. Often have to do duties you are not trained for or work in departments you are not trained for. Management expects too much of normal employees for being an entry level job.
good,"During my time at Best Buy, I found that management was incompetent, and I had climbed as high as I was going to be allowed to climb.  To make so little money without potential to move up further, I made the decision to seek other employment."
good,All depends if you have good management. Everything falls back on the GM at best buy. Also i dont like that every year there is a chance you lose your job to some company re org
good,"Depending on your role, very demanding. Managerial understanding was very lax. Very unappreciative of their laborers, and a revolving door for who does their labor, if you know too much they bring in someone else and let you go."
good,"The store was terrible. I never got my orientation, I would be over worked without proper tools, I never got a benefits package. Working at Geek Squad was almost okay."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find the perfect solutions for them, but the management was corrupt and only favored people who were ""yes men"". Also a lot of the times a management position had open they would never hire internal they would always hire from the outside."
good,"Poor management. Poor ethics, poor disciplinary actions from management. Will not be able to move up unless you get really close to GMs. Sexist men in management!"
good,"Unrealistic expectations and over-inflated career promises. Worked for BBY for over 10 years in multiple states. Its the same wherever you go -  favoritism and cliques within the stores/districts/markets. "
good,"Good environment, fast paced at times. Learned a lot about big-box retail as well as warehouse protocol. Management at store level seemed competent but undervalued. Hardest part was that there weren't enough full time positions offered or available. Working the way early mornings was great because you got to dodge the rush but still got a lot done. Discounts were nice but should be better."
good,Two months a year the pay is great but the rest of the year is a struggle. No opportunity for advancement. Benefits are expensive for little coverage. Paid time off is good though.
good,"It's best buy. not sure what else you want. It was an hourly job working sales and dealing with technology. Moderately fast paced, but this obviously was highly dependent on your location."
good,"Best Buy can be a great place to work, but it is hard to advance within the company.  Also, the work culture is sometimes too forced on the employees."
good,"Overall the sales floor environment was good. My direct manager was easy to talk to, helpful, and quickly resolved problems. Upper Management focuses a lot on pushing credit card applications per day and the total dollar per day sales number for every sales floor associate. The communication between my direct manager and the general manager was limited. When doing performance reviews the review directly contradicted each others opinion. I was told I was meeting goals by my direct manager but not by the assistant manger."
good,"Favoritism was a big deal, a lot of the employees and managers had their own clicks and did not work well with women who had a family and small kids. Short hours and no incentives."
good,Management played favoritism a lot. Didn't care about skills or numbers. Management acted snobby all the time. I had highest sales but it didn't matter.
good,"I enjoy Besy Buy as a company but the culture is too laid back. Employees would rather be on their phones than assist customers. Yet when an employee wants to assist a customer it is only for a large sale. Employees are thirsty to claim a large sale they did not contribute to. Management is just as bad. The managers are lazy and are non confrontational. They are quick to ""take care of the customer"" before they will take care of their employees. Being a sales lead is difficult when you have no authority to hold your team members accountable and when the management team constantly tells you to let everything go. There is no accountability and no way of running a successful business model."
good,The last time I have worked here was in 2012. My store closed. Alot of the departments and positions have changed so there is not alot that relates to positions in today's store
good,"I liked working there in the beginning of my time, but a lot of things changed in how Best Buy was ran. The team members, management and the environment changed throughout my years working at Best Buy."
good,"Management is all about who you know and not about your skills. Doesn't complete disciplinary actions if it's someone that ""knows someone"". Atmosphere at work was always uncomfortable."
good,it was ok and it was a fun place to work. Id reccommend this place to everybody who wants a job and needs to make money. It was close and fun. a lot of fun fun fun
good,Coworkers make it fun. Really good discounts on a lot of products. Managers don't necessarily help you to advance in the field. Lot of cliques that happen among them.
good,Best Buy is OK. Not the best and not the worst. Management was fun  and friendly but firm when needed. They also do charity work and fundraisers for numerous different charities.
good,"Overworked and underpaid, can learn some skills but the cost may be too high.  The great employees are constantly leaving for better pay and hours. There is very little ability to move up."
good,I am working here part time at the moment. Management has changed hands quite a few times which makes procedure change a lot. I would not mind this if I was not reprimanded for following previous procedure in which I found a better method.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it was a best buy mobile at Cheyenne WY mall that has since closed. The job was mainly activating phones and selling phone cases. The after that at the end of the day low level employees would mop and clean and takeout the trash.
good,"no work/ life balance. they require you to work a lot and go  above and beyond, but pay doesn't match. they play politics when it comes to promoting someone."
good,Sometimes you may Have to pick up other people’s work in some departments. But loved working there I just couldn’t do the hours and maintain my home life.
good,"Worked part time as a seasonal worker for the holidays, it was fun but the management was horrible at that time, since then I have heard it has gotten better.  It was the holidays so it was very busy, I worked in the media center and as a cashier.  I learned more at being a positive and fun customer service employee."
good,Manager didn't care about you. didn't like the fact that managers were apathetic to work you did. not accomodating. didn't train you properly to get up to the work environment.
good,Best buy was ok but the hours and pay is not good. i worked my butt off and applied for other things but they always choose people who was late everyday and did not do there work over me
good,"You have to be able to sell mustard to a man in a white suit.  Everything they sell is expensive, and people these days are leery about spending lots of money on something just because you say it's the best. Good luck!"
good,"The company has no problem taking advantage of you, giving you full-time hours with part-time benefits. Being in merchandising, the amount of work expected of you is vastly disproportionate to how much they're willing to pay you."
good,"working at best buy has a few advantages discount, flexible hours, good pay for retail. negatives you will work weekends and all holidays. pay is not great."
good,"Best Buy is an okay place to work."
good,"I bet its great to work for if you are not labor focused in work. My posotion had so much down time i honestly thought everyone was just being lazy for the first few weeks. Then i realized it was more that micro managmemt to the extreme made it so there was absolutly no free thought and no insentive to really put myself into it. It got to the point i would fall asleep in my car and finally my boss, who is a good man and hard worker woke me up and asked if it was time to make a change in career path. Great people. Just not the job for me."
good,Usually asks to work unrealistic hours and double shifts during holidays. Good part time hours if you work sales or cashier. Not much room for advancement in the company. Good as a part time job if you like electronics and are in school.
good,"Overall this company is good to work for but be aware that when the new year rolls around after the holiday rush, they will squash your hours to 4 hours a week, nothing you could live on. no matter your performance."
good,"The job is okay for part time work, but it is minimum wage and relatively tedious. It is great for students just looking for a job to pay for going out or minor bills."
good,nice place bad environment Some things got said  to me thst made me uncomfortable and I had addressed the lady that was in my aera and it wasn't addressed or taken care of of the guy kept bothering me and I was like im18 and he was 30...
good,"I worked 5 years for best buy, really liked the job I did. Worked in the warehouse, though this job is something you use while going to school or trying to advance. Pay was not great, received a raise maybe twice throughout my 5 years working at this business."
good,"It use to be a fun and exciting place to work. Everything is cut-throat now. If you have 2 or more consecutive bad sales months you are threatened to get demoted and lose benefits. Even if there is hardly any customers, it does not matter."
good,"it is stressful being in a environment that stresses you over certain things that isn't in your job title.  "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,What do you really expect its big box retail. Was there for 3 years and was never taken seriously by upper management. More than likely your direct supervisor will be your only sense of a manager.
good,worked for the company for 3 years+. the company usually has great people and has a decent community and social involvement. The management seems consistently poor and there is little to no room for advancement unless you plan on staying with the company for 10 years. the pay is not worth the trouble and you can find similar employment without the exhausting retail politics.
good,"Typical day at work involves contacting any/all customers. Favoritism is very apparent among staff. I did learn how to converse with people on a daily basis, basic sales skills including working the registers and using order systems.."
good,"Geek Squad is a pc repair store that prioritized in lying to make a sale. The techs that did work on the devices had some knowledge but was quick to give back the device half fixed due to being lazy."
good,"A great manager that develops sales talent= great experience. Managers all about numbers= bad experience."
good,Working at Best Buy was easy and rewarding.  The hardest part of the job was using the outdated management systems.  Tools would frequently short out and reset themselves.  Also there were not opportunities to work more to earn more.
good,"Working at Geek Squad was definitely a good entry step into the IT world, but was not real support. I felt majority of the time at Geek Squad was being pressured to push their service package, and the rest was spent supporting the floor."
good,"Just a job to have to pay the bills while you're figuring something else out. The retail sector is already a high turn over industry, and this position is no different from what you should expect at any other big box retail store."
good,"I can't speak for all locations because each one is different. Aside from it being one of the largest stores in the district, there were approximately 5 different General Managers in just my short term of a little less than a year of employment. The location I worked for had a high employee turnover ratio, constant change, pressure to sell Geek Squad Protection plans and credit card applications to each and every customer, short-staffed, and constant pressure to work more way more hours than scheduled or to push become full-time with no raise. And the work/life balance is terrible. Beware, holidays and weekends are a given because it is a retail job, so don't accept the offer if you are a traditional Monday-Friday 9-5 person. Not to mention I lost a sibling who served for the Armed Forces 2 weeks before Thanksgiving and had to go out of town. Although I had notified my department manager of my loss, I was called to show up to work the day after. Furthermore, 3 days into my bereavement leave, not only was I scheduled for Black Friday shifts but also asked when did I plan on coming back. Lack of communication, privacy and no respect for military families."
good,"just could be better, pay is awful. Management could pay employees what they are worth. we work hard meet goals and its not commission but we still are expected to hit numbers which is not a problem but come on pay more."
good,Great place to learn and sharpen your leadership skills. I was there for 10+ years and it was the best business school I could have gone to. I had great mentors and good managers for the most of my time there. I started as a part-time associate and moved up over the years. Training was the best if you want to get into sales or marketing.
good,They have their way of doing things and dont care for someone who speaks against it. They will look out for the company and the company alone. They will always fall back on policy when defending themselves even though they break it at their will for other people
good,"Its a good retail job, discount is really good, coworkers are ok, no commision on items sold which was a disappointment,. lots of information to learn about products which they expect you to learn at home."
good,"Management could take more heed to employee needs, overall not a bad place of employment. Clientele that frequent are not your run of the mill individuals, take time to learn their needs and you will be successful. Pay could be better, however as a starting position or a part time job on the side, compensation is not awful."
good,"Best Buy is a highly charged organization; the teams work diligently to achieve remarkable results for the customers, share holders and other them employees."
good,Cool place to work.Great co-worker and team. nice customers in and out of the store.Easy going work environment. And good work schedule. I really liked working there.
good,"Working for Best Buy was not going to be a career job for me. It was a job for the meantime, but I was always looking for better. I had great coworkers to work with and some of the management was great to work under. I needed a full-time job with a pay that will allow be to be stable."
good,"Great place to build experience as well as make purchases with discount, however, it is virtually impossible to move up in the company, as well as management is very quick to use salespeople as scapegoats to get out of more significant problems. I was fired because someone hacked into my till passwords and stole a considerable amount in gift cards; they couldn't prove it was me. However, I took the hit for it."
good,"Best-buy Noho can seam nice at first the staff is friendly enough and i can safely say that i consider many there friends while i was working. the problem comes with management and the company cloture of sales expectation and while this is standard and to be expected in most retail environments, however the work couture of NoHo is in an entirely different level i have seen people who i would consider good people miss inform or outright take advantage of peoples language barrier to meet sales expectations. i my self was pressured to stay past the stores closing hours on black Friday even though i informed the manager that i had class and a midterm exam the day after. Bestbuy noho has a lot of good people working in its halls its just that"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Each day I would print out day to day inventory forms that I would walk around the store and count making sure the product was in the store. Complete daily receiving from incoming UPS trucks and company trucks. Complete daily paperwork for inquires concerning missing product in the store. Complete outgoing shipments for product that would be sent off to be prepared. Clean and maintain an organized warehouse.
good,"Management showed obvious favoritism, no benefits or paid time off for part time, management did not care about employees if they were having problems at work"
good,The way management was it was very stressfull they didn't fully train me and when I would ask for help they had horrible attitudes I did learn a lot about the company I just wish it was ran better
good,"Pay is ok hourly, however no commission even if your the best seller in the company and country. Sometimes they would have certain goals, and when they saw that as a store you were doing awesome, they would increase the goals so we wouldn't get a bonus. Some of the people are cool though. Your manager will either be awesome or terrible. The trainer I had was amazing."
good,"I personally got bored easily.  Standing all day is fine as long as something is to be done.  Without something being done to help keep a productive day, is havoc."
good,"If you enjoy tech, Best Buy is a great start to get your foot in the door. Colleagues are friendly and nice, but employees are encouraged to go and interact with customers in hope to sell protection on the device. The training they provide is great for someone that had little to no sales technique.Management might step on your toes here and there but Best Buy has never been stressful."
good,"The company is growing and successful, and has a decent share of the market in outdoor apparel category. "
good,"For those trying to get their foot in the technical door, Geek Squad is a great way to go.  It was my first technical job and open the way for many great opportunities."
good,"managers keep pushing you and you receive nothing but they do. For whatever you sell whether it be a television, a remote or even batteries, if it makes money they make money"
good,Ive worked Best Buy for four years and have seen a lot of theology advances. There have been many awesome people that I got the chance to work with. It was definitely a chapter in my life.
good,"Being around new tech is always a good time, majority of the people are friendly and they are always looking to be helpful my experience with management wasn't the best, actually showed up for work to open and my supervisor didn't open the store because she was literally too drunk, when she did arrive i got a warning for being two minutes late. Something ill never forget but overall the place isn't bad to work for there's always opportunity if you are willing to grind it out and get where you want to be in the company."
good,"Best Buy had a select opening procedure that had to be done the moment you walk in the door. After having all shelves packed and making sure the area was clean, we began to let customers in. Everyone had to stay in their area and only help customers that came within that area. Weren't allowed to speak your mind just follow whatever you are told."
good,"Best buys - Direct Sales was an upstart for BB and the first such venture in the Atlanta area.  It never fulfilled its promise and subsequently due to under performing sales was shut down a little more then a year after it was opened.  I did have the opportunity to work in networking and Unix systems.  Designed an inventory system and built UNIX, Netware and Windows PCs and servers."
good,"Like any retail job, hours are scarce. Expected to do much with little time. Enjoyed going in super early in the morning and being off by 10am. Typical day consisted of stocking, doing ad, customer service and cleaning."
good,"On a typical day I provided customer support,handled cash registers,return products,hosted,cleaned counter area. The managment is a little hard on you. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the different people you work with and meet."
good,This was a decent job to have. It was fast paced most days and I enjoyed the level of responsibilities I had. Although they defitnetly do not pay enough. you would think a big company like Best buy would pay well and they don't which is why I had to leave.
good,"Best Buy used to be amazing, now I feel mistreated and disrespected. I was heavily involved in the company for years as I also worked at Future Shop, due to family reasons I needed weekends off for the next three months, I was approved of this last year. Due to the new management this will no longer work. I'm being forced to resign and I am very hurt by it. It would cost the company more to hire my replacement and train them, than to keep me."
good,Its a good place to work if you love technology playing with the  the latest and greatest toys how ever the store location i was at was high pressure for (RPH) Revenue per hour and (BP) Branded payment. i was really good at maintaining my number it maid it competitive and my fellow employees weren't very happy the pay was low the bonus was occasional and basted on store performance so if every department did hit no matter how good you did you didn't receive a bonus. Everything i learned i learned from other reps about changes ect.
good,"I loved working here. but the management was the worst. i had kids and couldn't work certain hours and it was a huge problem. but there was another coworker who had one child and was allowed to be off when she wanted, and weekends off. The GM is always on vacation, if shes there she doesnt know a dang thing about the product and is giving customers the wrong information."
good,Overall this is a good place to meet people and grow a network. It is not the best because there is nothing but micro management everywhere and most GM's are obsessed with numbers and could care less about employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Some good leaders other and few terrible ones. its basically a college job don't expect more out of it unless you want to be trapped. I enjoyed being there at first but over time that changes.
good,They have excellent training but not enough hours because your not part of the in crowd. What I noticed was the people who got recognized was the friends manager and supervisors recommended. Good because I was in college but not for personal career.
good,"Politics, lack of career advancement even when you go above and beyond. Some great leaders, more not so great leaders. Heavy workloads and minimum work-life balance."
good,"Management was horrible, this was my first job and they forced me to quit. Hours were horrendous, I was only part-time but people always called out and they would call you in all the time to work. Management was stuck-up and acted better than everyone. They only cared about their numbers. The store manager would stare over your shoulder to make sure you asked for donations for St. Jude's just so he could go on his free trip and get all the praise for doing nothing."
good,"It is a retail store environment with a sub-par public IT department. Mostly we receive virus riddled computers from the general public who do not know how to avoid internet scams and dangers. I have learned quite a bit about repairing windows 7 through 10 machines and Macs. The culture is very gimmicky. Management has no real idea how to run an IT department let alone how to properly assist with issues that come up with client computers. Hardest part of the job is trying to repair computers using only ""geeksquad approved"" tools. Corporate purposely handicaps us due to not fully understanding what is required to repair most computers. My co-workers could work anywhere with their knowledge base and I have learned a lot from being on a team with them."
good,I was surprised to see that employees were not aware of the standard processes existing in their work environment.
good,"At that time, communication was the hardest with the other departments. The change over and risk of people losing their jobs, job security became an issue."
good,"I work their for some time. it was a job for the time through going college and its defintely a fun place to work with the toys. "
good,"Sales are the most important thing to Best Buy. The only thing that matters to your manager is sales. So instead of trying to help customers get what they really need, you're trying to get them to spend more money on useless things like the Geek Squad protection plan.....but hey, it helps to improve your GSP rating."
good,I worked at 3 different locations and had 3 different experiences. The company offers great training and has a good culture. Experience is going to vary depending on Management and strength of sales associates.
good,"Top bosses had painted on smiles. Little involvement...no concern for employee....work life balance, training, job security. Training totally lacking...new employees train newer employees...not enough supervisors to train or monitor. One week you work 70 hours, the next week you may work 25 hours."
good,They don't really care about employees just what sales you can make but do not offer commission .  Better for young people out of high school not really somewhere you can grow and build a career
good,"The job at Best Buy is great, given that the management actually cares about the employees under them. If you have an issue with a customer, the management tends to take their side. Sometimes the environment can be fun, but the management can also ride you if there is nothing going on. Would not recommend working here"
good,This is a good job for starters going to school looking to advance there career in life. Its difficult to have a future in the retail regardless how good you are it means nothing. You give them 100% They always expect more and more.
good,"Horrible Management. They make you sell warranties and products even if the customer doesnt need it. "
good,great for a part time job not full time. great employee discount but not compensated enough and bonus structure is flawed. slow paced for the most part except for around the holidays.
good,"Best Buy as a whole focuses on the customers needs and their needs geared to the future because it's a store that sells technology and with technology constantly changing we like to teach and coach our associates to give the customer something they aren't only going to enjoy today but grow into with the proper accessories needed. I love that about best buy coaching and training is still an important factor. If you're looking to make an advancement at this company it takes a lot of time and networking and by that I mean have a great relationship with all leaders no matter what. Overall this company can have it's ups and downs like every job, but the people are wonderful you learn basic team building skills and you meet a lot of extraordinary people along the way. The only downside I can really say is a big deal breaker for me is the managers don't communicate well with one another and it causes a lot of conflict between the sales associates and warehouse associates."
good,"Great discounts across all departments! Lack of a good General manager, no customer flexibility for good deals. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Generally fast paced, heavily ranked based on various metrics, management can leave plenty to be desired, hours can be spotty, work life balance can be difficult (management and company insist that they care about the balance and want you to spend time with family yet they expect you to work every holiday.)"
good,"This job is fine. Lots of work, not a lot of time to do it in. Hours are usually 7a to around 3p, the store operates 7 days a week so requesting 2 days off in the middle of the week to go to school is easy."
good,Best Buy as a whole is an ok place to work but the store I work at is poorly managed. The store manager is young so he does not know how to run his store. He tries to be everyone friend instead of their boss. Many employees pretty much do what they want to do
good,Being a consultation agent helped me learn a lot about what would eventually be project management and propel me to what I would eventually end up doing.
good,"Fantastic company.. for the most part. Provide tons of training and opportunities to help your local community.. just have to know where to look. Great benefits- tuition reimbursement, insurance, 401K, discount. However, when you have a management team that sucks your store does poorly. Need to clean house on some managers!!! So many great and knowledgeable employees leave because there are few chances to move up and new employees get hired on at the same rate you are being paid. Very small raises if you ever get them. If you find a good manager the company is one of the better ones to work for."
good,I've been at two different locations Management does make a huge difference I do enjoy being at my new location now. I just want somehing closer to what I want for a my future career.
good,THis was a fun place to be in the early 2000's. We were able to have fun while still working on the floor. We had store meetings on the beach and company parties.
good,"I would recommend this job if you are looking for a position that not only challenges you, but pushes you to be better every day, every hour by attempting to meet sales goals."
good,"Best Buy was an excellent part-time job while I was going to college. I would not want to make a career out of Best Buy though, and at least at the Store I worked at there was no way to move up and almost all promotion opportunities going to outside hires."
good,"typical day can vary due to climate of the, learned how to be an even better seller, management at times were good, culture of the store was pretty stable, hardest part of the job is finding customers when there weren't any most enjoyable was helping customers and the interaction"
good,"As far as working retail its not all that bad from my experience.  "
good,"When you work retail, you work retail hours.  All holidays and nights. Did not have a work life balance.  Could not use any leverage against vendors; They did what they wanted."
good,"It was fast paced, busy, energetic, hot, balanced, well organized,  flexible with hours, hardest part was keeping a smile even when the customer is wrong, even when management is wrong."
good,Most important part of this job is Customer service. This job is all about the customer since Geek Squad is inside Best Buy a retail store. Fast on getting computers repair for all customers.
good,I learned to love and hate retail from my experience with Best Buy. More than anything I also learned not to trust my managers while working at Best Buy.
good,"Great people to work with, management needs more training though. I worked for this company for  decade and they didn't promote me into positions because of race.  Sad that this is happening in a country like Canada."
good,"Because of my GM who took care of his friends before his duty to the company or its values , or basic overall fairness and integrity, I was forced out because I was not one of his personal friends. A sad way to leave a company that at one time was great to work for."
good,"you dont get to many hours in a week, they dont offer a lot of full time positions. But the discount that they offer on the products is the best i havent seen a discount like it before."
good,"This is a good intermediate job to have before finding a professional career... or a great job to have while or before you have earned a college diploma or university degree... If you have graduated from a polytechnic college or university, I would advise that you only have a job like this until you find your real career... Management is often hypocritical and doesn't follow the rules that they set. Majority of staff only has high school diplomas. If you don't want to move past mediocrity, stay here... Otherwise, this is a good survival job at best. Much better than retail or a restaurant."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I've learned how to take care of customers and go above and beyond what was required. I treat them, just like I want to be treated. Most of the management is great. The best thing about Best Buy is all the different kinds of people and personalities you get to meet."
good,"Productive, sometimes stressful, Workplace culture is Relaxed. Good benefits for full time employees. Good opportunities for advancement if retail is your thing."
good,This job was a typical retail job. There was basic training for part-timers and more training once full time was reached. Full time positions were few and very hard to get. The workplace culture was decent and I learned a little about technology.
good,"You get paid to learn"
good,"It feels like your regular box store, if you worked retail before this is no different. Meet sales quota but no reward as other companies have. Coworkers are great people though"
good,The Best Buy that I worked had Management that allowed harassment and favoritism based on race. I reported this to HR and the next day the harassment got worse and then I ended up leaving the company.
good,the management expects you to do more than what is required and they dont pay anymore for doing so. most people are good to work with but the ones who arent make it not worth it
good,"If you are in management you need to have a backup plan.  You could lose your job at any moment, whether its from the constant restructuring or they want to make an example out of you.  I left at a good time.  Benefits were cut, jobs being eliminated, stock was plummeting.  They were doing everything they could to stop the bleeding.  My particular job was inventory and everything to do with it.  Shrink was important but it wasn't important.  What I mean is you were held accountable for things that were out of your control but when you try to enact procedures to fix the problem no one had your back.  I worked for them for 8yrs and was relied upon to fix problems in other locations many times, but when I quit, there wasn't a peep from the district staff as to why I was leaving.  In management you are stretched very thin and work/life balance is nonexistent.  As a part-time employee you may like your job."
good,Company is ok however most employees are simply seen as numbers vs people. Which is understandable to a point as business still needs to go on but attrition would be much better if they cared more about employees
good,"It was sometimes extremely slow, sometimes extremely packed, it is incredibly hard to move up and sometimes job security is something the managers play at"
good,"Everything was good, working the hours  were great until my life situation had changed, I was still able to work the required hours but trying to go back to school and I couldn't close anymore that's when everything got worse.  I even sacrificed myself to ride my bike to work to get my job done but it was still not enough. Not enough recognition as an individual.  Of course every manager had their way of leading and getting the work done but they didn't get to know you.  I won an award and they still don't know how to spell my name correctly or know/understand who I am.  I applied for a new position with the pre-existing work schedule (opening shift)  they forced me to *quit* because they wanted me to close.  If I stayed and struggled, they would've fired me, they made me put my 2 weeks in."
good,"Hours are somewhat doable, but not enjoyable. Lots of standing in front of store and rarely making sales due to a number of employees working. Overall its an alright job."
good,"As they say, the fish rots from the head... down. So does Best Buy."
good,"good job for experience.  not sure if I would recommend to anyone. from my experience in the company, there are a lot of benefits to working at best buy however, if you stress out easily or don't work well under pressure, I wouldn't consider best buy a place to work at."
good,Enjoyed my job.  Enjoyed my coworkers. Felt I was properly compensated for the work I was asked to do.  Job security felt tenuous as the management seemed eager to write you up for any infraction real or imagined.  It's no wonder that Best Buy was struggling as a company a few years ago as all of their stores are run by jerks
good,Different goals than in the US.  The main focused of the company is to make profit. They advertise being the “best buy” but in most of the cases they are not.  Employees don’t get commission but are required to sell “services” that in most cases are not needed.
good,"It's retail at a management level. Which means most of your day is being yelled at because a grown up's toy is broken and they need to blame anyone but themselves about it."
good,the company is great however in my store favoritism tends to be too common. you will not be promoted or rewarded unless you are in the inner circle. this is apparent to me with the fact that i far exceeded goals and lost out to others that didn't even get close. any other management team would have fired said employees however in my location these under achievers were rewarded because they were on the inner circle.
good,"This was a job that i absolutely loved. I liked what i was doing, i enjoyed the challenge and my co-workers were very supportive. However, when it was time for me to transfer for the summer when i returned home . The company snuck and fired me. Ironically, I did not know i was fired until my seond day at work at the new store since my first day was during the weekend and when i called HR thats when i found out. I enjoyed my experience but at the end of the day the company only looks out for themselves. And their quick to let people go."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The work environment is usually very easygoing. Most of the other employees are very friendly and approachable. The work is repetitive, but not too difficult or stressful. The upper management was not usually understanding, and their personal performance issues were also placed on those working beneath them. The pay is not very competitive and benefits are not usually obtainable by part time employees."
good,loved the job but the mangers suck  it lasted 2 years then bull carp finally built up and that was it they need to re train and fix the mangers for a good business
good,"Best Buy is a great company for young or older people to make some money, for the most part the pay isnt the best thing, depends on the situation, if you are over qualified they pay decent. Leadership within Best Buy, just like anywhere else can be great or a nightmare. Mostly a nightmare, everyone thinks they run the show and it can be overly stressful for no reason at all. Everyone tells you a different direction and it can make simple things take a whole day to complete. Going in to just make a pay check and being a sales rep. its not so bad.."
good,"Best Buy is a great tech company offering new products and services. Typical sales job, with minimal opportunity for advancement. Worked there while I was in coolege."
good,"Can be a fun work environment, there are times when management will be very demanding of associates sometimes with unreasonable requests. This is a great job for somebody in school and that is interested and has a passion for technology. Benefits of the job are great as well."
good,"Constantly stressed that you need to perform better as an individual. But promotion/ raises are determined by your entire department. Never any coverage so constantly called in to work on days off. People are pretty cool, most people are young. The older people working here are usually generally unhappy people.It is fun to mess around with all the new electronics. Discount doesnt hurt, but doesnt make up for the low pay."
good,Under staffed without any help from management. Working alone yet being penalized for not taking a lunch on time. The workplace culture was clicky and there were politics. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and learning how to multi-task during high stressful situations.
good,"worked over the Holiday season wasn't too bad time went by fast, plenty of places around to go eat at if you didn't want to bring a lunch. break room was cool."
good,"Mostly based off of metrics. Managements treats employees like the are expendable. Minimal growth potential with minimum wage pay. Employees compete with each other, steal each others sales, and use dirty selling tactics."
good,"Coworkers are interesting"
good,"great start to any sales job"
good,"The job itself is interesting if you enjoy the technological side of Mobile devices but the targets are somewhat unbelievable, the goal posts are constantly being moved and there is little to no progression in the position once you become an Agent."
good,Bestbuy has an odd structure and goal setting culture. The goals are all numbers driven by the number and volume of sales done during the workday with zero reward for hitting said goals.
good,I Enjoyed working here for a seasonal position. Co-Workers worked well together. Management needs improvement. Company should care more about their employees job security
good,"Good vibes, nice people, and have to teach yourself, because nobody wants to train you. All they are there for is the check at the end of every two weeks and leave when their shift is over."
good,"Perfect for someone who loves tech stuff."
good,A typical day the office I begin to help customers that are in need for a particuler product. I also assess Geek Squad department with minor projects.
good,"Standard Retail job. the benefits are great when they don't take them away because of a bad sales quarter.  "
good,"Processing orders all day. Nothing to hard. It can get hard during peak season, you'll get all the hours you could want and a nice paycheck, but it gets tiring. Once peak is over those hours and money are far gone though. It's not to hard of work the people are great."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Can't complain too much about this company. "
good,"Hours suck (retail), management does not like to listen to employee issues, never a set schedule, ""Hourly sales goals' are a joke, and compensation for work and time with the company is an even bigger joke.  :D"
good,"Best buy it's self is a great company to work for, just not the department I'm in which is appliances. Pay is good and so are benefits. The people that work there are always fun to be around. You work 8 hr days so your typical 40 hrs a week job. Never have a set schedule because unfortunately it's retail. I learned a lot of appliances. The manager is hardly ever around when you need him. He will continue to push off dealing with an issue until it has been escalated to a point where there is no saving it. Not everyone there is a team player and they only look out for themselves. It 's a non-commission job, so no one should be hassling customers or stealing sales but unfortunately it happens. Manager shows favoritism, he is consistently on his cell phone rather than leading by example on the floor with his team."
good,en un dia tipico habia buen ambiente de trabajo en el cual lo hacian los empleados y promotores pocas veces gerencia casi nunca y pues era muy cansado estar muchas horas con pocos cliente trabajar sin comision solo sueldo y tampoco era lo mejor pagado lo dificil era lidiar con el gerente si venia de buenas estaba muy tranquilo el dia y si venia de malas a veces ni te saludaba o todo el ambiente se volvia tenso y hasta negativo
good,This section is a required section and I prefer not to provide additional comments.  Please refer to other online sites to receive additional details about this company.
good,"Everything is fine and dandy until you make one mistake, then theyll find any excuse to get rid of you."
good,Managers were expected to do more then they were capable of doing. Due to being understaffed it was hard to get every aspect of the job done. Employees were not happy working because they were stretched thin with little compensation or pay. Hardest part of the job was having to help a crowd of people who were upset they had to wait sometimes hours to get the product they wanted. Best part of the job was working with all the different types of technology.
good,"- a typical day at work consisted of assisting customers in returns and exchanges and performing any other register transactions."
good,"It's retail. It's in a college town. The turnover rate is tremendous, the amount of work they expect out of you is not unreasonable, the goals are a bit ridiculous, and clientele isn't terrible. It's not a place I'd want to go back to, but it wasn't the worst place I've ever worked."
good,Picking orders for stores.  hours every day various that doesn't help pay the bills. Best buy as a company is a follower not a leader. Days of work is Sundays through Thursdays.
good,"It's retail - need I say anymore? This was one of my first jobs. It was fun, but definitely not a career. I would never want to do anything like this forever."
good,There is a lot of room for growth in Best Buy. The training process is almost non-existent but if you are a go-getter you could promote fairly rapidly.
good,"Best Buy  had been through a difficult past few years, but with great new leadership they have changed and adapted to meet the new customers needs, with instore inovations and great omni channel growth"
good,Depends on the management in the store. I have had great and terrible management. Customers can feel way too entitled and sometimes customers are treated better than the employees.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in to work a shift alone, either because it was scheduled that way or someone just didn't show up. Customers get very agitated when they realize you're the only person who can service their cell phone. I learned to be extremely independent, as no one really taught me how to use anything. I was just alone on about my 3rd day on the job and had to figure it out(I was also alone Black Friday, the busiest day of the year). That's usually the hardest part, and the most enjoyable part is once you actually know the system and can converse and sale to customers."
good,Sometimes your expected to take abuse beyond the norm from customers in order to make a sale.  Demanding hours.  The sales and events can be a nightmare.
good,Really not primetime for the company. Has been focusing alot on the results and numbers a little more than the customer and also employees
good,"Interesting to help customers and generating revenue, co workers are fun, busy environment. Hardest part of the job was learning about all of the products and the difference between each one"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"the don't pay well"
good,i believe they have alot of problems in there Asset Protection protocals i think they should have 2 to 3 asset protection individuals so that you have 1 roaming and 1 at the door and 1 in high traffic areas. depending on cameras is a bad idea because it leaves too much to if the asset protection is looking in the right camera at the right time. the fact that if your at the front you have to stand the whole time is a horrable thing because it destroys peoples knees and back to stay in one spot all day. the hardest part of the job is dealing with management who will be on your case because of small things like there is a piece of paper in front of the desk on the ground. we are told to not leave the back of the desk for any reason so getting yelled at for something we cant change because we are told not to move is bull.
good,I worked for bestbuy for a year. During my time there my average day consisted of walking the sales floor and talking to customers. The biggest issue that I found was management at the company.
good,"Best Buy was a good part-time job for me while finishing up University, pay is min wage or slightly above. Management were accommodating with school hours and personal life."
good,Na. Management isn't as great and the culture isn't that great either. Managers are constantly breathing down your neck.
good,I didn't enjoy this job sense the gm didn't know how to ring a customer out and didn't  even know how to do my jjob. I didn't get very good training learned most things on my own.
good,its an okay job to start with. its just like any other customer service job. i would recommend this job for anyone that is a college or high school student. its not alot of pay and the hours vary based off of sales
good,Poor leadership at the district manager level. Many great Store leaders left the company rather than put up with micro-management and lack of support.
good,"Tedious and monotonous, but with competitive pay for the job sector. Numerous advancement opportunities. Sub-par benefits. Most of my co-workers were extremely proud of the brand. Management was often assumed to be a buddy-system where friends promote friends."
good,"Best Buy has good benefits that I would think are far better than what the rest of the industry offers. I have not had any other job in retail though so I cannot say for sure but that was what I was told. They cover a good portion of the medical insurance and offer dental. The discount for products is great! And there's also Employee Accomodation programs where you get great discounts offered by the manufacturers to the people that sell the products. Best Buy also has 401K contributions and an Employee Stock Purchase program, and they even have tuition reimbursment program--but the last program is bogus. There are some outlandish requirements and stipulations to that program in my opinion. The basics are you must be a full-time employee(40 hours) enrolled in school full time(12+ credit hours). You pay the tuition first and submit your grades at the end of the semester and if you pass all classes they will reimburse up to a certain amount. It seems ridiculous to me because you must make yourself available to work at the store for shifts that are not the same every week AND be enrolled in 12 credit hours a week, which is at least 12 hours you must add to your schedule that you cannot be at work. Granted I did not try to qualify for tuition reimbursment, but I find that to be granted it would be next to impossible. "
good,"In many cases, at places like this, your enjoyment of the job is from a mix of co-workers, managers and how well you know or enjoy what you are selling.  In my case, one out of three is somewhat bad.  If you are a student (high school or college) and just need a job to get through the summer, then it is really good for that.  Even working on Black Friday wasn't horrible, just inconvenient."
good,"in retail you learn new things everyday. i appreciated that because it helps you grow. everyday was different. every job has good days and bad, myself personally had both. it's all about being optimistic and doing everything you can to make the company grow, along with yourself."
good,overwhelming and rushed. Management needs more communication.  Half the time other managers would not know what one was suppose to due.
good,It was an okay job. Had a lot of fun with employees. Had a decent amount of rude customers over things I could not control. Pay per hour was quite low when I worked there.
good,"Only reason to work there is the discount and its not even that great... Bad management, worse training, and worst to be ""part time"" you have to submit 5 days of availability. Not willing to work with people that can't provide that."
good,It was always a long day with not enough employees.  Our store was closed down and most employees left.  I was getting payed as a supervisor but I was doing the job of a manager.
good,Built a rapport with customers and proposed different products and services based on their account history to help minimize their monthly bill. Committed to the assistance and support of others while maintaining a cheerful and helpful attitude.
good,They need better management. They should not be allowed to use their positions to be little others. The hardest part about this job is that the other locations were a lot better than two notch rd
good,"A disjointed management structure makes it hard to problem solve and improve productivity.  Often, leadership is more concerned with the numbers and statistics rather the concerns or ideas of it's workers."
good,"As a former ASM - Ops Manager I can truly say that, the store is a mere showroom for online retailers.  SM's and above are disconnected from the associates, setting unreachable goals in this bad economy."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Nothing too exciting, simple work, however you're expected to be like a ""cars salesmen"" with customers and push products, not just help them find what they are looking form."
good,"Overall, the company is great, pay and benefits. A typical work day would consist of building a rapport with each customer and to recommend a product that fits each of their needs. I've learned many great skills since being there, knowing how to welcome customers, selling skills, and closing each sale. It does require lots of energy to do this everyday but if you love people and the products that Best Buy sell, then it's a great place for you. However, it also requires a lot of patience, which means, you must be willing to help customers who don't understand how to use their products. "
good,"Learned a lot about wireless audio solutions and new products that are on the market. The stores screw up the orders often and rarely ever help fix the issues. No consistency from day to day, and the Clients expectations aren't solidified before the Installation Tech shows up. Management is supportive, but cannot do anything about the issues that we faced. Co-workers were both a saving grace and a cuse from day to day, depending on who you worked with."
good,Typical day at work as a sales associate is to greet customers and determine their needs and desires and ensure they have all the pieces to meet those needs and desires.  Also make sure they understand how to properly use their new device and any other accessories they get with their device.
good,I loved this job but you could get no support form your supervisor.  The company was excellent to work for and the benefits were good.  The holiday hours were rough but they only lasted 3 months out of the year.
good,I worked here from 2011 - 2014.  I generally enjoyed the job however I felt that unless you belonged to the clique of management that you were generally passed over for promotions of opportunities for advancement.
good,"There is very little room for advancement working for Best Buy.  The employees that do work hard and try to make an improvement at Best Buy are the employees that are taken advantage of.  There is little to no recognition to the employees behind the scenes.  Members of management can not be trusted, and the managers that can be trusted are ridiculed by upper management."
good,"Advancements are based on favoritism & not based on qualifications, company downsizes every year to 2 years which eliminates room for career growth. Work life balance is awful, it is retail but the off the clock work needed to do to is not how businesses should be run. Compensation is a little higher than typical retail stores however kiss your social & family life goodbye, unless your part time. You do learn quite a bit on how to run a business if your management teaches you and spends time with you which is ultimately beneficial in the long run."
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for if you do not have a family. It is a fun environment to work in most of the time. Customers truly make or break the job.
good,Great at training their staff. Advancement is based strictly on favoritism. They consistently push you but offer very little incentives for hard work.
good,I work at customer service and it can be difficult to deal with some of the customers and management. Some of the managers have a bad habit of letting the customers be disrespectful to us and they reward them by giving them what they want as far as a return beyond policy. the other employees are ok to work with but the atmosphere tends to make for unhappy co-workers. The best part of my job is being able to help customers that really appreciate our advice and help we provide.
good,Working very hard to help customers and employees. I learned great leadership skills and how to delegate projects properly.
good,Working in the warehouse was a satisfying job that allowed me to learn more about customer service and working in inventory control.
good,"Working at the Best Buy located near the Pentagon and Washington, DC catered to a broad spectrum of customers. Military personnel, embassy workers, white/blue collars employees/employers and students from several universities was overwhelming in proposing a universal store theme. My position was very demanding and receiving conflicting goals or revolving management."
good,"Typical day included constant attention to customer's needs and inquiries. Learned about various hardware and software in all departments overtime. Management was okay, lacked in leadership skills and assisting coworkers when under pressure from customer(s), some managers, not all of them. Hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours and pay. Enjoyed learning about new gadgets and products."
good,"Geek Squad is a good job for someone looking to cut their teeth on working with computers, which is exactly why I started working there. However, the pathways for advancement here are blocked by a management staff that can't seem to decide from one day to the next who is the most qualified person for the job. Policies shift overnight with no briefing to the people actually doing the work and client experience suffers as a result. That being said, it's a decent job that pays alright for what it is and Geek Squad tends to attract good people who are both knowledgeable and friendly."
good,"The store I worked at was biased amongst favored cliques. Other than that, it was a lot of learning on-the-job, but a great experience."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The region I was in was difficult to maintain high numbers in which the supervisors would accept. The managers were either unsupportive or extremely rude and would not want to work under them again. the co-workers were great but a few of the male co-workers tend to flirt with the other female co-workers making the work floor sometimes unbareable. Apart from the cons, there many kind customers and had it moments where work days went by smoothly."
good,Lots of pulling meaningless data without much strategy behind it. Learned a lot about retail systems and pricing analytical.
good,"Dealing with customers, selling product, and just overall store operations are in a typical day. "
good,The Management are not able to communicate with there employees in a proper way in order to get the job done and has a real issue with promoting people with in the store witch should be addressed. Typical day there would be helping clients with there pc needs and putting out frieght from the day before
good,"enjoyed the people"
good,"N/A. This is a corporate company with many great things and many things that could be improved.  Great benefits, retail hours, every employee works very hard."
good,"This job was retail based in a box store.  I was not that happy in it, but was laid off in my previous job and this is all I could find.  It was a part time job and didn't pay much.  My saving grace was, I worked in the computer department and I love hardware and software.  I thrived."
good,a typical day would start at 7am loading waggons.then check waggon secure.then go out rest of day delivering to shops.found management helpfull.co workers were very helpfull and helped when they thought i needed it.hardest part of job was loading .the most enjoyable part was traveling.
good,There is no life/work balance and the training provided is not close to what is needed for your day to day tasks. More worried about sending an email and recapping than making he business a success.
good,"When  I worked for Best Buy I was labeled as an inventory/sales associate. My main duties were to make sure that the products within the store looked neat and clean. I would also stock the shelves with new product on Thursday nights, and on Sunday mornings I would change the prices within the store. I also was required to assist customers with questions if they had any, and assist with a sale if needed."
good,"Salary sucks and raises are minimal. There are opportunities to move within the company, but its pretty much a politics game in this line of business. An oppressive, tense work environment that makes an employee dread going to work.Employees are micro managed down to the most minute detail. Work can be fun at times but also a hostile work environment with all the pressure the manager put on their employees. Discount was great!"
good,Siempre sabes que  te van a llegar clientes  y cada uno de esos contactos debian ser concretados
good,"It was part time retail selling cameras . The problem was the way the time was scheduled so that you couldn't plan the rest of your time. "
good,"They ask way to much out of one person to sell a cell phone. My manager was a complete idiot and had no clue what was going on half the time. People were stupid too because no matter how hard you try to explain to them, they always find a way to make you look bad. My co workers were stupid aswell because they looked like a bunch of monkeys doing a football when it came to sales. I honestly felt they put me in a special school to show the retards how its done."
good,"Overall, Best Buy is a great company to work for. They offer great on the job training and E-Learning opportunities. For the most part, it is a fun working environment. Our Customer base was varied and diverse, making daily business fun, intriguing, and interesting. Compensation was fair to below average. As a member of the Leadership Team with over 15 years of experience and a Bachelors Degree in Management, I only made $15.50 an hour. With bonuses of approximately $1,000, my annual salary was only $33,000. My Immediate Supervisor was fantastic! My first General Manager was just as great. He transferred after about 8 months and a new GM was brought in. The new GM was terrible! Rarely dealt with customers, always passing them on to someone else. He was not a people person, more or less all about ""himself."" Many of the regular staff quit within a month of his coming onboard."
good,"This company does not spend enough time on focusing on Loss Prevention. During morning huddles and evening huddles, blue shirts and some management could care less about harnessing the importance of security and loss prevention. Not a great place to make a career if Loss Prevention your motivation."
good,Sometimes it is extremely understaffed! Management tries to make you stay passed your scheduled time without asking you first.
good,"It was a good place to work, I liked the pay and I liked the free food around the holidays. Its usually busy. Co-Workers made it so the day would be a good one, but the management there was terrible. they tell you they care and they would do anything to help, but really every time you asked for something like a name tag or a shirt they acted like it was a huge deal. Hardest part of the job was the customers and how busy it was all the time. the most enjoyable part was the co workers and the break room."
good,"You always hear of ""that one employee that started from the bottom, and ended up at corporate""...While possible, this is a company that you have to know someone to help get you there.  Even as top salesperson, you get little to no recognition, and when attempting to advance in the company, they generally don't hire from within (at least in my experiences), will even use the excuse that ""you're over qualified"" to bring in another manager's friend."
good,"While manageing back office records such as payroll, schedules, P and L, Shrink prevention, and overall sales of the department, one of my strongest focuses were to develop and train my employees, With doing so I have had 5 different employees under me that have moved on and up in the company at different locations in the same job that i am doing."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Troublshoot Client computers & Electronic Devices. Help them understand technology and provide solutions. I've learned that end-users cause about 90% of problems related to devices physically and functionally. Managers are not always in the right places. Hardest part of my job is trying to explain that running over a girlfriends laptop is not considered accidental damage. The most enjoyable time is when I help someone and they are actually grateful.
good,I think it's fine if you are a student live at home need only need 20 hours per week.
good,"I've been with Best Buy for four year and seen the amount of ""restructuring"" they do year to year. Simply put... I was a manager of the mobile phone department and Best Buy decided to restructure management. Eliminating my position completely! I was ""lucky"" enough that I could drop down to full-time & keep the same pay, but if I was one step higher in management I'd be forced to look for another job..."
good,"I loved interacting with customers and informing them on new and cool products.  What I didn't like was management treating customers as marks and that ""every customer needs to buy something."" When you tell management why someone didnt buy something they would constantly tell you that everyone who walks in needs to walk out with a product.  Sometimes people arent ready to purchase.  Sometimes they are truly killing time and checking things out.  Managements logic was terrible.  Throughout the day we would get hourly ""number reviews"" and every time they were lower than our extraordinarily high quotas for the day.  I just didnt like the treatment from management except for my direct supervisor."
good,Is a good place to immerse yourself into the tech support field.  There are constantly a line of customers looking for help.  The job was pretty exciting and fast paced.  Very poor management running the place.  Poor pay and benefits.
good,"Going into work every morning to count 21 registers daily, depositing the money through Green Screen. Ordering supplies if needed and as well order change if needed. Train new hires and coach. There isn't good management in our work place. People pretty much do what they want to do. The most enjoyable of my job is having to work with my co-workers they're always seeking for my help and as well helping others when needed."
good,I learned a lot here and am great full for the experience i had. Cross trained in different septs getting more skills
good,Best buy was a fun place for a while but the job taken over your personal life. Hard to have a good balance.
good,To inform and educate  customer on services eligible to them.
good,"the starting pay is good, nice discounts, but the work hours is not so good."
good,"With multiple positions held within this company a work day consisted of assisting customer with making the proper product choice of their liking. insuring online orders have been completed and shipping (internal/external) was properly logged and marked. Accounting for product entering and exiting the store. I was also responsible for insuring all marketing and sign structures were up to date and properly priced."
good,You'll never be rich but it helped me through college. All and all not a bad place to learn retail
good,"•	Accept payment from customers via cash, check, credit and debit card "
good,"This job...pay was right at minimun wage, but they gave me 40+ hours. Co-workers were constantly wanting to switch or give away their shifts so the lower pay ended up working out for me. Bad part is to become an official full time employee, you have to be there for many years. One co-worker was there for 5 years and had just become full time. No health benefits or vacation time if you are not full time. Breaks were 15min, lunch 30min, worked 14hours straight during black friday. This is a job were you have to stand up the whole time, no sitting down or leaning on the stations table. 30-40% of customers were always unhappy about pricing or return policy so it created a stressful day sometimes."
good,Interesting view of the retail market integrated into the IT world.
good,"The place was full of modern gadgets, which is great, I love technology. And after a while i learned everything that there is to know about appliances and Televisions, but it didn't take me long to realize that there were a lot of ""internal hiring opportunities"" that were filled by people outside the company despite the fact that many current employees applied and were better qualified than the individual that took the job. The management is constantly changing, in the 8 months i have been there the store's General manager has stepped down twice, and ALL of the lower ranking managers have taken jobs outside of the company. Sales associates and customer specialists are constantly leaving and being replaced, and worst of all, business is at a low point, yet the sales goals do not reflect this and the employees are hassled because they are not meeting the unrealistically steep sales goals of the store. On top of all this, the General manager can be frequently heard asking customers to fill out an application because sales associates are desperately needed, yet  the average amount of hours that my department gets is 15-17 hours a week. That being said, I do not regret working here, It has been an invaluable glance into retail, and i feel that i have had my eyes opened to many opportunities that i would have otherwise never noticed."
good,"The best part of working here is the discount!  I would buy a ton of extra stuff just so I had it if I needed it in the future.  I really learned a lot working here, P/L management, hiring, training, inventory accuracy."
good,"I love the sales environment and community the company provided. They recently went under a company restructure and most of the good, motivated employees left."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working for Best Buy has had it's ups and downs. It can be fun in the aspect of being around the new technology and getting to learn about it before anyone else does, but the company as a whole as many flaws, which is why I'm seeking a newer and better job career outside of the Best Buy life. Every couple years they go through a reconstruction process which is where they get rid of a lot of positions within a store causing a majority of people to be without jobs. This makes it really hard to want to move up within a company that when every 1-3 years they fire half the employees PER store. When people finally do get promotions and raises, it's the ones that bust their backs the most that get left behind because the more you show that you care here, the less you receive in return."
good,"My work is challenging given the undetermined scope of work for any given day as an installer. It's enjoyable and working with the public is very rewarding."
good,It was fun while it lasted. To grow in the company may take longer than expected.
good,"I would begin my day by taking inventory. The most important thing that I learned at Geek Squad was to be patient and kind to each customer as they came in the door. The management at my local Best Buy lacked structure. The  management seemed to struggle to reach agreements with one another. In my opinion, my coworkers where at times unsatisfied with their careers and seemed to strongly dislike their jobs shifting the workload on a few people. The most difficult aspect of the job in my opinion would be lack of effort put forth by my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to solve someone's problem and bring them relief."
good,"I started working for Best Buy as a part time sales associate right at the end of summer before the seasonal employees began to be hired in. I came in expecting at least 20 hours a week as a part-timer because thats what I received at KFC, my previous employer. So Why would I expect any less from the worlds biggest tech retail store?"
good,I wish It wasnt a temp job. There were a lot of different things going on within the company I didnt agree with but a job is a job and I wisj I was still there.
good,"Lacking in leadership in the individual departments, no sense of team work and Extreme Confession. Job Security is a BIG Negative. they will not Hesitate to let you go and people who hold higher position in the company over step and play with peoples jobs and life"
good,"It was a job, and that's it. The people I worked with were all right, but that was luck. The company was definitely not working for me. As a part time worker I was not allowed time off and was told I would be fired if I requested any time off."
good,"When I started here in 2005, I found it a fun environment and a great place to work. But, then when we got a new general manager, I felt like the place became more strict, cold and less friendly. People started dropping out of the store like flies. I felt like I tried to explain to some to the management team about some problems, they said that they would help me with my problems, but they never did. Because, I felt like they brushed my problems like dust under a rug, it made it very difficult to work there. My Co-workers have felt the same way. The Best part was unloading the delivery truck, because there was always something to do and it made time go by like it was nothing."
good,Store 390 in Mansfield was a wrecking ball on itself. Management plays favorites to much to create a comfortable environment. As I was leaving new management was to be set. They will put you in positions that are unethical and almost a catch 22. Keep an eye on pay. Aside from that the experience gained is excellent.
good,"Never have any problems with my coworkers, hours are very low though and not much room for advancement."
good,Best Buy is a place to work if you just need a job. you will make great friends with co-workers.
good,working in geek squad was great. i learned a lot of my technical knowledge and skills while employed there. the management sometimes took a while to get to you when needed in situations. my co-workers were the most enjoyable part the job.
good,Managers were nice for the most part and teamwork was used a lot which was helpful but attitudes a lot as well in the workplace
good,Work for the Christmas season. Too many hours working until 2 in the morning. Would not work with School.
good,Best Buy was my real first job where I was able to be experienced in different parts of retail from customer service to selling. I liked the fact I was able to be myself there. The hardest part from the job was being micro managed.  I also didn't like the fact when I did work there I didn't have a personal life.
good,Typical day included cleaning and organizing shelves and helping customers find certain items.
good,A decent place to start if you are looking for experience. Would not recommend staying for more than 5 years unless you are opting to be a manager. Learning curve for the job is relatively easy. There is not a lot to remember and anyone can do this type of work. Management changes every so often that one has to get accustomed to the new manager's way of running the store.
good,This is a forever changing company that has its own problems keeping people in their position for fear that they are going to close its doors.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has a good work atmosphere.  Most employees are friendly and willing to help one another when needed."
good,Really enjoyed working for Best Buy doing in home TV and Appliance repair. Always learning something new with all the new technology that is changing with all the products we repair. Enjoy working with customers and going to their homes to repair their products and resolve their issues.
good,"This was a job with a broad list of duties and responsibilities. The culture and values were made enjoyable to learn and carry on. However, a high turn over caused for the inability to really establish connected professional relationships at work necessary for a ""TEAM"" environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
good,"Everything was great in the beginning. The hardest part of my day was dealing with upper management as they were not open to many ideas. My co workers where great and they were the most enjoyable part of my job. A typical day began at either 9 am or 3 pm. It was inconsistent shifts, inconsistent. I would arrive and right away it was about that days target. Nothing about the good job we did yesterday. The whole day would go on as normal. Great customers and all that jazz. It all went 6 feet under everyday when your manager comes around and makes you feel worthless about not reaching your goal. My job consisted of being a ""pro sales person"" followed by the ""best cleaning lady"" only to continue on ""receiving our truck"". You're not a sales rep. You're a minion. Unless you're a supervisor or higher."
good,"They informed me that pay raises were rapid, as was growth within the company. After months of working there and talking to other, more seasoned, employees I learned most felt stuck in their current situation with no sign of a raise or transfer to higher-paying department. I have a house, a wife, am 27, and in need of higher pay for bills. Hourly pay is nowhere near enough and would benefit someone if they were:"
good,I started out as a technician but left a leader.  Towards the end of my time here I would manage 66 technicians and supported 20 services managers.  The hardest part was the constant lack of work life balance which kept me from having a complete day off.  When I was not at the office I was on the phone during my days off.  The most enjoyable part was satisfying the customers.
good,"Lack of professionalism from management did not present a good work experience for me. After working seasonal I was offered a permanent job which switched me from the multimedia section to cashier. Co-workers in that department had nothing positive to say throughout the day which made work more unbearable. Understaffed on a regular basis was not helpful either. Unfortunately management never noticed the lack of training for their employees which made the team work effort almost non-existent. I can't say there is much else to say about my experience there, but then again that was years ago."
good,"I constantly provide the best customer service possible in a fast paced electronic retail store such as Best Buy. I have learned many things such as product knowledge  and communication skills, my co-workers are on the same page as I am when it comes down to understanding the daily business. I have to say that not having proper coverage is hardest part of the job and learning about new things such as products and the ability to help and educate another person about what the latest technology can provide for their lifestyles is the highlight of my position."
good,"I really loved working there in the beginning , although, after the first 2 yrs it started to decline in moral. Their starting pay decreased and with cheaper pay and long hrs , came disgruntle employees and irritable managers!."
good,"These jobs (Sales support, Asset Protection, Cashier, etc) all pay the same range no matter what job you apply for (8.75/hr). This might be great for a person in High School or just starting College but is unrealistic for people that have homes, cars and the like that require a payment or else. For three interviews it hardly seems worth to go through all that hassle unless you really need it. The schedules are planned not thinking about the employee at heart and even if you want a day off make sure you get it in writing or else you will never get it approved and some excuse will be given to you (poor management). Benefits are good only when your full time. regardless of the fact, if you have no work experience, this is a great starting job, wait a year or two, then you can go further, just do it with someone else that will treat you better and give you better pay."
good,- Utilized product knowledge to engage customer's interest- Responsible for customer purchases and handling money - Interacted with customers at service desk
good,Day started at 6AM. There was no support as far as management or co workers. It was hard to smile.
good,"Poor management.  Does not respond well to customer satisfaction.  Long hours, especially in positions that are higher ranking in the store."
good,"On a given night I was asked to:Implement or monitor processes to reduce property or financial losses. Investigate known or suspected internal theft, external theft, or vendor fraud. Identify and report merchandise or stock shortages. Inspect buildings, equipment, or access points to determine security risks. Monitor compliance with standard operating procedures for loss prevention, physical security, or risk management. Prepare written reports on investigations."
good,It was just a job nothing special at all. Corporation that did not care.
good,Al about the numbers on a daily basis. one day you can be hero and the next if you dont live up to expectations start searching for other jobs or brown nose your way.
good,"I started working at Best buy in 2008. For the first year it was a great place to work. However after that things went down hill. The company didn't do a good job at dealing with the changing market. They fire higher payed employees just so they can bring someone in that will work for less. The management as well doesn't seem to want to follow the companies own guidlines on many different issus. As well many managers and the employees they like would get away with murder. If you'd try to bring it up your the bad guy. I found each year less and less good people would work at the store. However if your lazy and want to get payed for doing almost no work its a great place. However if you take pride in working hard and want to work in a place that others do too, don't work for best buy!"
good,I learned a lot about how to sell electronics. I was able to aid in the development of others. As a junior manager there didn't seem like there was much room for advancement. There were long hours and days away from my family which made things difficult.
good,"No support from management. Hard to move up in the company, unless you know the right people."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I found this job was fairly easy, because it focused alot on sales. However there is no career oppertunity unless you have been working for them over a decade."
good,It was alright. Learned a lot. Worked with proprietary tools. Remote repair was used most of the time.
good,The company are good to work for.
good,"The days when we were very busy, we had a lot of fun and had a lot of positive energy. Very diverse group of people (Team members and customers)."
good,Best Buy has become my personal purgatory. There used to be days when I would wake up and actually be excited to go to work. I love the people I work with and that has been the only thing that has kept me there for this long. The company and their logic and decisions that are supposed to help improve our business have honestly just brought the store down. It isn't exciting to work there at all and the management is that great. I love who I have for managers but the one that runs the store could definitely use a lot of improvement on how he goes about his daily business.
good,Was a seasonal position. Did not enjoy the work environment. The hourly rate as well as the amount of hours were not satisfactory. Had to find a job opportunity elsewhere.
good,the employees were usually overworked for little pay
good,Best Buy is your typical retail work environment. It wasn't a bad place but it wasn't amazing either.
good,Fun place to work but not much room to move up of chance for pay increase.
good,"The management is crazy, they tell you one thing and do another. The co-workers are awsome! I love everyone I work with! The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to see my friends everyday and know that I am making money while having fun working with friends."
good,Always something that must be handled. They do not make anyone on the sales floor accountable for their actions. Only way you will get fired is if you steal or don't show up. Management is terrible.
good,"On an average day most customers would come in, not knowing exactly what they wanted but a general idea. A sales person's job was to find a total solution by asking all the right questions and pull the right answers from the customer to keep them from having a bad experience, always offering solutions."
good,"I worked for Best Buy for over 8 years, in sales, service, and leadership. The first 6 years were fun, but as the economy worsened, Best Buy changed policies to compete with Wal-Mart. This led to decreased benefits and higher stress across the company. Geek Squad is now treated more as a sales department than the service department that it is meant to be. It has the best pay in the store, but raises are small and hard to come by. Management experience will vary greatly from store to store. Difficult to get time off for any reason."
good,Typical day revolved around helping customers.
good,"It's a good company, but some positions are hard to try to up in the company. It's hard trying to get a full time position because they're limited and those are the only position that get all benefits. The coworker are great, the make the day fun but some managers are lazy and don't know what they are doing. if your like a student or someone jus looking for a few extra dollars it's cool but if it's all your going have i wouldn't it."
good,I would not recommend this company to anyone. The pay isn't comparable to competitors.
good,It is Retail. If you like Retail go for it. Loads of politics to move up but a person can if they know the right people
good,Overall I enjoyed working for the company.My issue was with not getting proper training and the turnover rate for management.
good,"I really loved coming to work at best buy but things went down hill over time. I learned so much about different types of electronics, and always wanted to move up in the company, but it felt as though you had to be part of a friends circle to move up. Even with metrics being met and exceeded, moving up was hard. Pay was also not competitive and new hires were making far far more then senior employees. I was with the company for 2 years making $11.20 where as new hiring were being hired on for $13.75-$14.50 which was the ultimate reason of my leaving."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical days at work were productive and usually fast paced around all holidays. Slow days included improving the appeal of the store by cleaning, dusting, front facing products and printing product tags. Typically, our team would also help other departments in the store. I have learned a lot about how to get to know customers by asking the right questions and how to apply it to their desired purchase. Also, I have gained knowledge on a variety tech products. With honesty, management at best buy could have been better due to the fact that employees have not been valued. Also, there has been some dishonesty and disorganization specifically with scheduling. In general, management does need improvements. As an employee, there was very little culture to live up to. The hardest part of the job is when the store is overly busy and managers have unreasonable expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the training sessions from different vendors with provided lunch."
good,"Good days and some bad ones. Over all the company is good, when the managers have their good days. What is also good is the fun activities that they would have for us."
good,"No comment. I'd prefer not to provide my views regarding such position. Everybody doesn't have the same experiences, therefore, it would be improper to deter someone who may not otherwise have a similar experience."
good,"Can be very political in dealing with leadership, not the best little work/life balance. Very cult-ish, but if you drink the kool-aid, you're rewarded."
good,"Working with upper management was tedious, advancing was based not on merit but on employee relationship with managers. Compensation was not good. Benefits ok."
good,You have to get a good store  avoid Midtown Charlotte. All you will hear is how your not selling enough. They take advantage of customers especially older ones .
good,"Floor associates have to fill a certain quota of sales of the ""Geek Squad"" services to be considered a good associate."
good,It was okay. The kind of job that you would like to have in college to pay for books. Not really a place you want to stay long term unless you want to go to corporate.
good,"You will learn a lot. Work is tech-based so updates you with the latest tech advancements. Training is very well provided and you get an ample amount of time to complete your training. However, they hire a lot for the seasonal term and you might get kicked out after the holiday season."
good,Job is simple depending on the staff. Management needed some improvement with the scheduling. The hardest part of the job was how fast-paced it could get.
good,"Out of most retail environments, Best Buy does put focus on the employee which is key. They are going through a transition but they continue to understand employee needs and act on them accordingly."
good,If you are a seasonal worker as I was and worker hard and was never late and only missed 3 days from being sick in the 5 months I worked there the chance of becoming full-time is very low unless you are good friends with a manager. Just like most companies now days working hard and doing more than you have to will not get you hired full-time it the politics of work it not like it use to be.
good,"Very difficult to move up in rank, wage is somewhat unfair as people of the same position are paid wildly different wages. Overall atmosphere is fine, they say that they don't encourage people to sell competitively but they absolutely do. Management at some of the stores was fantastic, and really terrible at others (passive aggressive, lazy etc)."
good,"Before they made changes to remove the Connected Home department, that was my position. I sold products ranging from headphones, security devices, smart home devices, smart watches, modems/routers, and a few other smaller items."
good,"I went weeks with only a few hours scheduled. Management seemed disorganized at times. Most of my coworkers were not as friendly to new people or other departments. Dealing with customers was great with a few exceptions, some people were rude and demanding"
good,"El salario que ofrecen a los especialistas es muy bajo, tienen muy buenas prestaciones pero el salario malo, aún siendo de recursos tienes que trabajar los fines de semana cuando no tienes casi trabajo y tienes que cumplir tu jornada laboral completa."
good,"In retail, this is probably one of the best companies to work for. But it is still retail. "
good,"The managers were horrible and the environment was not welcoming at all. It was quite flexible, I wasn't micromanaged but I barely did anything. Everyone was always on their phones."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"For me it was my first in store sales. Being that I was use to others sales ""Auto Sales"" was a little different. I was use to commission and or Salary. At Best Buy you did how ever receive a bonus but, in order to have that bonus that department had to all reach the numbers. I wasnt use to meeting and or going over the required numbers and not receiving the bonus. Having worked on salary and or commission I was use to receiving  what i worked for. other than that I enjoyed working there."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for over 2 years and my coworkers and management team were some of the best I’ve ever been a part of, I saw many people though including myself who gave 110% everyday and never grew within the company and ended up leaving after years of working with Best Buy"
good,"A significant amount of the people were easy to work with, but there were those people who tried to make life hard, including some management. Not having the ability to try and fix the issues because management would not back you was difficult, but it still had the good days that made it easier to get thru some of the bad ones"
good,"Best Buy Geek Squad feels like a visit to your grandparents house. You feel like you have the freedom to do what you want but you know in the back of your mind that you are being watched at all times for every tiny thing you do. "
good,"Best Buy provides a decent starting point for anyone who wants to work in tech. You'll have the opportunity to talk to customers and see what would suit their needs, and it can be a rewarding job if you put time into learning the product and making sure that your clients are well taken care of."
good,"Unpleasant pressure from corporate trickle's down. Good people are everywhere. So is corporate. Luckily I got to work with mostly good people. Need a paycheck for awhile without too much stress then this job's for you.  "
good,"The family-like vibe of the fellow employees was great, but management treated everyone awfully. Corporate heads were pressing difficult goals for the stores to achieve."
good,"A typical day for me would be to get customer orders, help people load their products, ship stuff out, receive stuff, go for cart runs, unload trucks, check restrooms, paperwork, and get recycling. I learned a lot about how inventory works, and how everything behind the scenes works. Management has always been bad at the one I worked at, first we were short-handed because they kept people on the payroll who quit months ago. Workplace culture is good, really a good environment if your coworkers know the basics. The hardest part of the job is the holiday season, just because it usually takes us all day to finish trucks. You would go in at 5 PM and get out at 5 AM, also the customer orders during the holiday season become overwhelming. Was stressing out more about that than school, didn't get much sleep during this season. The most enjoyable part of working there is the fact that your coworkers usually will always be top tier."
good,"In the beginning it was good,  PTO for Full Time is GREAT, Management SUCKS at least mine did, they did not care about their employees, only about themselves."
good,"Worked for Best Buy since 2014, it was always fairly stressful especially during the holidays. When I started I was just a sales associate and during my time I moved up. I tried to apply for lead roles that my management would never give me, even for a position that I was over qualified for and one that no one else wanted. They didn't want to do the paper work or pay me more. "
good,management was not the best pay sucked and a lot of e learnings was a good job for what I needed at the time if you are just starting out its a ok job
good,"Even though your labor is supplied by Apple and supported by Apple on the back-end, your pay and other benefits are managed and restricted by Best Buy. If you have a great team and support at your level, you will earn what you're worth, but this was not the case at the time I was with the company. I left the company due to making a 3-4$ an hour below the market rate within the major city area for that specific role. Their unwillingness to give an inch me led to me looking elsewhere. However, the company purchasing benefits were fun, and I liked having flexibility with my schedule. The role's bonuses were based on overall store output and therefore often unattainable based on individual performance. The job is not commission, but metrics were pushed strongly as if they were. I would recommend the role to a young professional just starting in the workforce needing a paycheck, but not anyone serious about getting a foot in the door with Apple. I retain strong connections with many people from that location, so despite my harsh review of the pay decisions made, I wouldn't go so far as to write off Best Buy entirely. I enjoyed working with my team and we found ways to ""have fun while being the best."""
good,"Pros:"
good,"This job pays well...if you are a single college student that has no ambitions of moving up or devoting much time to the company. Managers are heavily influenced my politics and favoritism, and only want good sales numbers and nothing else. During my stay, 3 people were fired because of tardiness, and regardless of influence or skill they possessed, management still removes them"
good,"Lowest paying company when it comes to Forklift operators, discounts are good. Shifts timings are also better than most work places. They spend more on superficial stuff than they spend on you."
good,"The company is great for someone with little to no work experience. This is due to the low compensation. There is also very little opportunity to advance based on work ethic, positive customer feedback, and consistently exceeding results. During my tenure, I was told by many different managers that growth in the company is 20% what you do and 80% who you know. So if you are someone who is looking to do great work and bring experience and consistency, you will be hired but not advance unless you network and relate with the managers."
good,"Good health care, discounts but not worth it with the cons of the job and management. Great people, awful management across the board. Flexible schedule, discounts were amazing. Loved the people in my department."
good,This company reforms the way they achieve their goals and eliminate the veteran employees or force them to step down regardless if you are their top performer and by doing so forcing them to leave and loss of pay in one year I went from the best in the east coast for performance and had my pay cut 3 times and forced out of my supervisor position
good,"The area that I worked in was very competative."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It is a great place to get your carrier started. There is a lot of things to learn in this industry and Best Buy will help you learn them. Best Buy continues to change with the times.
good,Good Job if you're in highschool. Some of the leadership team is quite confrontational. Don't like being told they're wrong. Best part of the job is just the co workers.
good,"Management is guys club, they can be moody to anyone not in the club however as an overall company they were flexible and paid decently to their leadership"
good,It was nice to have in college. The scheduling worked around my classes. Management was typically lackluster and the pay is pretty low. They removed commission while i was there.
good,"Was great at the beginning but after almost a year and interviewing for other positions in the company in order to grow with them, they made it difficult, interview weren't even professional and the fact that some managers thought it was okay to say thing's like ""not everyone is born to be a leader"" made me realize I was working for the wrong company. I got a box thrown at my face by an employee who did inappropriate things including to customers and managers never did anything about it , even though it was on security camera recording and even if the manager saw him doing these thing he just didn't mind."
good,"I learned a lot, from what products to accept as a return, how to communicate with customers and access their needs. I learned about warehouse. shipping items out and finding items in the store for customer pickup. I learned more about electronics than what I knew before. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment and team. I really enjoyed the job until we got a new district manager, and management started falling apart. I started to dread coming into work."
good,"Working there wasn't terrible, but it was definitely all about cliques. If you aren't part of a clique, you're really not going to get much friendly advice nor any type of help. Management is subpar depending on your store, but they're not super helpful 90% of the time unless you're in-front of a customer with them. Good management is difficult to come by as well. Just do your part and try to be as friendly as you can and you'll be okay."
good,"The company itself, could improve on certain aspects when it comes to moving up within the company. Staying true to its moral is dependent on the management that each location has."
good,"The general manager is authoritarian and has complete dominion over all managers and employees. She we will complain to managers about your work style so that the managers will have to talk to you instead of her. She is very aggressive. The store has lost complete motivation due to this and many people are leaving or being fired. All the employees have complained to upper management and they decided to do nothing about it because the sales numbers are okay. This is a horrible place to work under current management. Everyday is a gamble whether I'm going to get fired over minor things or not. Im stressed every minute I'm around a manager here (Which is pretty much all the time)."
good,"Management could be more helpful when customers ask questions,instead of passing the customer off to  another employee.It would be nice if we had a sink in our breakroom to wash our dishes.We currently have to go to the bathroom to wash our dishes."
good,It is an okay place to work. just feels like too many chefs in the kitchen to run one store. The work ethics from others is not the same and there is favoritism involved as well.
good,"Too much focus on sales goals"
good,It's like any other retail job. Poor management poor job culture. When first worked there management was great. After 5 years it went to he'll. Retail will always be that way. I worked there for extra money. That is the only reason you should work there.
good,The managers here suck combine that with low pay makes this job something to have while your looking for the next best thing but dont get comfortable you can get stuck for years before you realize that you have not gained any new marketable skills.
good,"Being the busiest store in the area the opportunity for rev per hour goals to be hit is high, but the training is minimal, the management is not able to coach and motivate and there are little to no growth opportunities."
good,If you know technology and can sell this is the place for you. I liked the people I worked with and the discounts were awesome. But they make you work on thanksgiving and that sucks.
good,"It was job. You did your job and you left. It was stressful though because of management. Your best was never enough, even if you hit your goals for the day. Management was never satisfied. They would yell at you literally on the floor in front of customers. The pay was average and good luck with getting a raise (25 cent raise every so often). During finals week I requested (well in advance) to get the week off to focus on my finals and my manager denied it and later said ""no because we're a family and family doesn't leave family hanging"". My co-workers were cool though, so that seemed to lighten the day at times."
good,"Its sales so unfortunately you are expected to be available for all holidays, major sales, and weekends. The management can be a bit edgy. When I first started working there I was extremely unhappen with how things were managed. Management changed maybe 6 months after working there and it began to get better. There is definitely favoritism involved so it can be hard for advancement unless you are on their good side which totally depends on meeting/exceeding your sales goals. They do not believe in commission but you are tracked as if it is a commission job. Expect to be coached on how to improve credit card applications and warranty attaching to sales. It can get very frustrating."
good,"Best buy has plenty of benefits and different avenues go into as far as employment. Whether you're a technical, sales, physical or all around people person."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Fun place to be, but pay isn't great, management isn't either and unless you're sucking up to everyone you won't get anywhere. However, you can easily make good friends there"
good,Management often times were unfair and I found the experience to not be the best as turnover was high and there were disconnects within the teams because of that. Aside from that the work experience was helpful.
good,"As a sales associate prior to FY19, the sales goals were in line with traffic and reasonably set. As the holidays and beyond have come and gone, the sales goals have increased exponentially beyond current traffic and are therefore unattainable by ethical means, thereby unfairly placing unwarranted strain on employees."
good,"Competitive work/sales environment"
good,"I worked at Best Buy out of necessity. I learned a few things that I still utilize today, but overall, it is a very strict culture where sales numbers trump everything else."
good,"After Amazon began to take over the online shopping experience, Best Buy had to dissolve certain aspects of its company to remain a competitor. I understand this about business so I had no hard feelings. But what stood out to me is that about 90% of what the company taught me was strictly exclusive to only their company. After working there for years, I had not gained anything tangible that I could use in my personal life regarding skills. Biggest Let down."
good,"Was out on injury and they let me go.before I was injured they started having non qualified people start to try to do the work and I had to clean up all the work they did, and deal with an angry customer"
good,"great job if you go in with a game plan and agenda. if you want to move up, go in with that attitude. sky is the limit. if you start off slow, youll get passed by and watch a lot of people who started with you one day making upwards of 6 figures"
good,"Every day I help the team and store hit our daily revenue goals. "
good,"Management is a bit of a mess, they can lead you on, they schedule you regardless of your availability. They do have fun activities once in a while, again, the employees are fun but management needs rework."
good,"You won't make enough to live on your own or even with one roommate realistically, but you learn about a niche industry and how to sell it. If you want to be a salesman, it's not a bad place to start."
good,The Best Buy culture is a great place to work if you love technology and new appliances. I loved the people I work with and they are very helpful. But management needs help.
good,"Started out with great managers and employees.   Ended with horrible management and employees who lacked the knowledge to properly help customers.   The second to last manager I had was sleeping with one of his managers, and hiring young ladies to do the same.  By the way, he is or was married with 5 kids."
good,Run of the mil customer service job that takes care of you slightly better than average. Depending on what department you go to can be hard to move forward in the company taking several years at times to move at all.
good,"Manger would play favorites, and advance people that were terrible and lazy, because they were friends. Very cliquey among staff. Paid less that I deserved."
good,"Best buy is a great place to work if you have the right leaders to support you; Unfortunately,if they are not willing to do so,they will have no problem in attempting to exsanguinate those so they do not deem fit for future roles in the company regardless of their tenure."
good,"I've worked in several Best Buy locations and the work experience definitely depends on the location you are at. I have worked in a location were going to work everyday was fun and exciting. Management was supportive and cared about your career goals. At another location I experienced the exact opposite. I have felt like just a small part of a machine that could easily be replaced by another person. The leadership was never on the same page and there was never an achieveable work/life balance. One location I would have stayed with the company for a long time, the other made me want to run for the hills and quick."
good,"If you are purely entry level this would make a decent opportunity to understand the basics of technology and gain experience in retail."
good,"It was fun helping others and the team I worked with are still close friends, but the job didn't pay well and not many hours to go around.  Managers were always so enthusiastic about making money, but never when it came to personal development."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a decent place to start your career path but get out when ever possible, corporate culture is a scam for inexperienced workers."
good,fun place to work but can be ran in a more effective way. Good employees with different backgrounds that make the experience fun. need more full time positions with benefits
good,The Traverse City Best buy has management that acts like children. The benefits for best buy are the best I have ever experienced and one of the main reasons I stay with best buy. The employees are great. Everyone under management is happy and willing to help each other out. Geek squad is an excellent job if someone has a passion for technology and wants to know if they want to do it for the rest of their life without looking at the costs for college first.
good,but management isnt the greatest and they expect you to sell lots of extras to customers with ZERO commission. Will fire you if you dont meet quotas..
good,"Hated the job. Mostly because I hated sales. I hated selling the ""geek squad protection plans"" that I knew we're a total ripoff but my job performance depended on it."
good,"Going downhill, not the Best Buy I started working at years ago. You definitely cannot make a career here any longer.  More and more work and responsibility are tossed at you without compensation. Goals are not realistic and advancement is political and scarce."
good,"Clock in, count drawers, then deal with returns and complaining customers all day. The coworkers are fine people but when you have a manager who has nothing outside the job and has literally been his only job they expect the same of you. "
good,"Provided customers with background information on all electronics such as warranties and expected wear down time"
good,"Best Buy and Geek squad have a great internal Culture, however if you are looking to move up quickly it will not happen.  Also when it comes to hiring, they are going to hire internally first, even if someone is more qualified, its just how it is.  some of the Higher up management is great, some should definitely not be in the position they are in."
good,"I had the good fortune to be in Geek Squad and have great direct supervisors. But the BBY company culture, in my opinion, is terrible. Nobody ever seemed to enjoy working there, except for maybe the General Manager. Between the micromanaging, lack of employee trust and engagement, and oblivious managers (oh yeah, there's about 5 different managers telling you what to do all day), it was hard to stay on task and enjoy the workplace. There were a few managers that genuinely tried to help their employees, and I admire those people. They are the ones keeping the wheels turning. But there were also managers who couldn't care less about their jobs or employees. (I was one of only eight Geek Squad members and there was a manager who hadn't learned my name, even after a whole year) But overall, no one seems to notice employees who aren't in management or Geek Squad. Improving employee relations and engagement would go such a long way."
good,Not a bad company to work for but some of the stores specifically the store i was at is terribly managed. There was a lot of favoritism and employees being treated different.
good,"The managers there were pretty poor, but they were easy to avoid. The individuals that did work there were all rather pleasant to be around and conversation did really help the day go by quickly. You're almost always going to be busy. There were very few days in which we weren't rushing to get things done."
good,The hours and the pay are just ok. If you like a job with a lot of customer interaction then this is the job for you. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"A lot of my day working as a home theater/ gaming associate consisted of consistently checking on customers answering their questions, comparing products, and helping the customer find the perfect product for their needs."
good,"Because it is retail, customers talk down at you even if you have a college degree. They expect miracles and cuss at you when you cannot perform magic. I have grown a backbone working here but it also caused me to develop severe anxiety issues."
good,"an okay place to work, people are great, management is okay. Laid back work environment, no pressure sales most of the time.Hours are good too once you become full-time"
good,never on the same page with other manager. Everyone is usually all over the place. they try to blame everyone else but themselves & never wanted to let employees breathe.
good,Move up fast or move on. If I could have done different in would have. Keep your nose to the grindstone. Hard work can pay off great fully. Do what makes the district managers happy.
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee and the staff in the store were sometimes not very kind or welcoming since they knew that I was ""just a seasonal"" and wouldn't be around long. Many of the adults working in the store behaved as children and therefore it made working there a bit difficult... Overall though, the customers, products and the stores themselves were great and the experience gained was good to have as well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The company itself is a great company to work for. Best Buy is always changing and reshaping their brand work to better help the customer experience. On an employee level however, unless the worker is full time or a veteran worker who has been there for many years it is a bit difficult to build yourself and gain any foothold or traction to build a career no matter how much time and effort you put into trying to better yourself and your position. Favoritism is unfortunately prevalent when it comes to certain associates and managers."
good,work was flexible.  Working at Best Buy could be fun at times. Very fast paced.  Tending to customers needs and wants to make sure they are satisfied with purchases and services
good,Working at Best Buy was a good learning experience. However the management was poor and employees concerns were not taken seriously. Employees were not given the opportunities they deserved.
good,"Although bestbuy is a great company to work for, I believe the company is not as organized on the corporate level to meet the demands of the customers/stores. Logistics/product delays ruin the reputation of bestbuy and it shows."
good,"In home Installation and Repair services. Ever changing scope of work, limited training on new job requirements, experience and seniority mean little or nothing. Measurement metrics are the only performance tracking and often change without notice."
good,not much room to work in a so called warehouse but these stores are small so i expected to feel cramp when i worked. so mostly had to search for something if the system said we had it.
good,Few opportunties for advancement unless you work there for countless years. I enjoyed working with customers but management was difficult to work with.
good,"Best Buy can be a rewarding place to work for, but more for the person who is still in school or for a starter job. It's not to say that it's bad, but it's not my ideal place to work. However, they have a great culture and you build strong relationships with your peers."
good,"Operations Supervisors are all about gossip and talking trash about other team members.  To remain there, you must go along to get along... probably the most unprofessional group of people I've ever worked with."
good,Best Buy is a good company although it was tough with the schedule where they want you to work 10-8s and every weekend.    Also required 6 day work weeks during the holidays.
good,Each store has their own clique. Either your in and get along with everyone or if you don't play the company politics it can be very difficult to advance. Yearly reviews will be based of this too. Raises are poor
good,I worked for this company for two years and I beleive it is a good part time job especially for students. Their hours are flexable. They would make sure you understood your posistion and offered monthly training.
good,"I was there for 10 years, many times working over 40 hours a week. Management at times inflexible to allow weekends off to spend with family.  Have worked at two locations--Sioux Falls, SD and Tustin, CA--both locations I enjoyed my staff, but, in the final months of my employment, with the arrival of new District Manager and Store Manager, the workplace culture took a dramatic shift.  I was the last of the 'old timers' at my location to leave. :("
good,Thinking of a master plan. Ain't nothing but sweat inside my hands. Bet you don't know the rest of this lyric. No rapper can rap quite like I can Take a muscle bound man put his face in the sand
good,".Low work life balance, good pay, little long term security, constantly shifting employees because of giving the jobs to vendors instead of hiring its own employees"
good,"Great place to work it is a fun atmosphere, just make sure to abide by the SOP's in order to make things flow smoothly. On a typical day you will have many customer issues that you just resolve. some of which are very complicated"
good,"Best Buy is a nice first job. You use it as a resume builder and to gain experience to go elsewhere like Apple or Microsoft store. I felt that they only cared about making money, not whats best for the customer. Maybe this was only at my location..."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"All stores are different mine just happened to plummet in quality after some time. Favoritism can definitely happen, not too bad for a bit but I don't recommend sticking around too long."
good,Geek Squad is nice place to learn about computer support. They train well but the hourly wages are not good enough. Consultation Agent job is very stressful.
good,"Great company, good people immersive environment. It's a great job for beginner workers. The staff are very knowledgeable and can be a great place to work."
good,"To obtain promotion requires a game of politics. Fast pace and very matrix driven. Cut-throat for poor performance. Leadership lack actual management skills and organizational skills; considering game of politics for promotion. Work culture can be extremely stressful and have to be able to act quickly, think quickly, and provide customers with ""complete solutions"" to ensure low erosion and returns. Overall, if you do not have any selling experience or management experience, Best Buy is not the place for you. Even if you are applying for a cashier or sales associate position, Best Buy is not the place for you if you do not have any selling knowledge of management experience."
good,you can work you butt off and go above and beyond and they still wont keep you. They are nice and friendly but like i said you are lucky if they do not let you go
good,"Very good job easy to have. Some unrealistic targets they want you to hit. Also management is a little too high and mighty at times. Great coworkers, and meet some cool people"
good,"wage scale can be varied, raise never guaranteed. good employee discounts on accessories but none on name brand top products. days can vary, hours can vary, never a set schedule. always can find a weakness that would ""prohibit"" a wage increase-sketchy. hard to obtain your 15 minute required break. work schedule inconsistent, hard to know two weeks out what you will work. co-workers are fun people."
good,"I went to Best Buy after getting a new phone. I needed a screen protection. They had none and said I needed a custom fit ClearPlex. I went home and went back, got it done. But it had dust under it. Went back again."
good,"Thought to balance work and home.  Cannot disconnect hardly at all."
good,"Best Buy is good in that its a fast paced retail environment where you have to stay on your toes constantly to keep up, but it doesn't compensate you very well for how much harder you have to work versus other retail jobs. The only real benefits to working there are that it prepares you to work in any retail environment and that it offers discounts on some popular consumer products"
good,"Day as an ARA starts with filing accountability reports, and once that is taken care of, you get to the fun part of fixing computers."
good,"I was only there for a couple months during the holidays.. very hectic, not a lot of direction.  Nice discounts.  Wouldn't suggest working there long term."
good,"For 3 years and the Job itself has been nothing but a pleasure. But Management at my store was typically not on one accord, they didn't show much care of you outside of work, and I've been subject to discrimination and racially insensitive statements a few times from my direct manager and HR calls have done nothing about the situation."
good,"The atmosphere at best buy is definitely not for the slow. You have to move fast and be able to multitask.  The pay is horrible. The benefits suck when it comes to health insurance,  and management only care about sales and credit card applications."
good,"Worked there for 13 years, loved the environment, but my mentors kept moving to bigger and better companies. The last 5 years, I didn't have a good example of good."
good,I was in the top 1% in my sales category and only received a 30 cent raise after one year.  Was not given chance to interview for manager job despite my top performance and strong work ethic.
good,"Depends what position your in. I was working in the warehouse, which i did not like too much. Sales would of been a better position for me. Management is a bit stressful on getting things done in time especially during the holidays. Good discounts, but the rest of the benefits are a joke unless you work full-time."
good,I would clock in go and get my daily tasks and start completing the morning duties.  Then I would Down Stock until the store opened.  After the store was open I would assist customers with questions and help locating products.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good place to start getting into IT, but company only hires a select few for full time hours. Hours changed around frequently, no set schedule. Other than that, the job was easy and fast paced."
good,"High employee turnover at all levels leads to alot of confusion and favoritism.  Store managers typically work hard to foster an in store culture of fun, which means bbq's, staff contests, games nights and such.  Not much fun once youve been around a few years and see they're trying to compensate for poor pay and terrible job security, but still better than most retail gigs."
good,I felt like my time was being wasted while working at Best Buy. All I would do was sit at the front and make sure no one was stealing. Then I would walk around the store every once in a while.
good,"It truly is a great place to work if you want to assist customers in finding new items but the management is very rude and will act like you are stupid. You can have extensive knowledge on a product or the accesories and you will still be told ""shut up sell the newest item"". management does not care about customers or the comfort of their employees."
good,"The majority of employees are high school students who don't really care about the value of their time.  I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and the community.  There was no real push to educate and promote.  The few employees that were not in high school, who did have work experience, were not regarded very highly and once you reached your employment status compensation cap there was no support to assist in moving up in the company."
good,"There isn't much more to say. I spent fair time with the company, and throughout most of my time with them, the general procedures for operating were against the values the company states they follow. Not a horrible place to work, just not as focused on helping it's employees and customers as it claims to be."
good,Decent Job if you're in need of cash. Not a career. Job expectations and how management enforces and handles the expectations is poor. Overall not a great job.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working for Geek Squad. This company gives me the technical experience necessary to be offered an entry level IT job position .
good,The work life balance for store managers was terrible. Upper management lead by fear not motivating at all. The regional manager may have been the contribution to my experience as people work for people not companies.
good,I believe the company as a whole has great values. The one specific store I worked at was loosely managed. I was promised false promotion and a lot of opportunities were taken away from a lot of people who deserved them. The management was very high school like. For someone who wants to learn more in customer service I feel it is a great started because you get to learn a lot. But this one store needs A LOT of work. I wish when I was there that I felt I could trust HR if I needed to call them but it felt very cliquish.
good,"It is a pretty good temporary job, but if you plan on advancing, and want better benefits to accommodate your lifestyle, I would say look elsewhere for work. Other than that, it is a very good environment to be in because the customers make it that way. Good or bad customers, always allow you to have either a good or Hilariously happy day."
good,Not a bad place to work if you know how to work office politics into your daily life. A lot of advancement and preferred shifts are only given to those who go fishing with the management on the weekends. (Metaphorically speaking)
good,"Terrible training for new employee."
good,"I started off as a seasonal temp. But after 3 months, Best Buy hired me. I worked in the media department. I learned how to do managerial duties, open and close the store and delegate tasks to fellow coworkers. But I was never praised or thanked for my hard work from my time there. Other workers in my department who barely did anything were praised and thanked. I didn't really care if I had praise or not because I was doing my job. But when your supervisor of your department praises someone else for your hard work, it would get to you. Overall, it was a good place to work for the time being. I wouldn't consider working here long term."
good,"I was personally not pleased with my tenure at Best Buy. I would rather not disclose why.I believe that Best Buy is a company that has a very specific fit in terms of talent. Culturally they have been conducting day to day operations a certain way for so long that adapting and changing is not a priority for in store, district, or regional staff."
good,Giving Great customer service. Handling customer issues.Managing the sales floor and the associates. Reviewing and going over store numbers relating them to the associates around the store. Setting a positive example for the tone of the store. Hardest part of my job is managing different personalities with the associates and making the customers happy at all times.
good,"Some of my best buy family are still friends today, but work/life balance is a joke and pay does not go up with cost of living. "
good,Each Department is its own Culture. Make sure before you go in you determine what department fits your mindset. There are many upon many times that you will be doing something you were not even trained or hired for. Be prepped for nothing to be the same or stable as far as work requirements
good,"- Management pushes credit cards 24/7"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very male dominated work environment"
good,Decent pay but no work life balance for new family or parents with kids. Management is fun love the atmosphere but to many meetings and require you to give a review weekly to every employee so to manage that plus run the sales floor hard to balance!
good,coworkers and everyone is super helpful and understanding plus free food on big sale days they take take of you lastly great benefits and fun activities
good,"Best Buy was an enjoyable place to work for a long time. Selling electronics is easy and fun, as people are easily excited about technology. The problems are that you do not get paid much, several company policies are backwards productivity or success, and some managers are extremely unprofessional towards workers."
good,"Biased management, okay job, gets boring at times, friendly coworkers, sometimes it can be stressful, they say it's no pressure sales but it is during big sale events."
good,"At Best Buy I enjoyed learning about the thousands of products they sold. Ended up leaving due to poor management. Aspects of nepotism and no synergy is given throughout shifts. Management and supervisors do not listen to general employees experiences with customers and try to downgrade knowledgeable encounters. "
good,Best Buy was very flexible with my schedule as a Student. It is a good temporary job but there is no room for advancement or Full Time. Not a long term career.
good,"Theres a serious lack of career advancement opportunities unless you're willing to relocate across the country. In 4+ years only saw 3 people promoted, within a high turnover store, versus the over 30 I saw either pulled from other locations to be leaders in our store or out of our store to be leaders else where."
good,"A: pulling orders, breaking down pallets, stocking shelves, DEVO, dot com. picks B: how the Best Buy policies are C: management was fair with the employees"
good,"This site that I worked at didn't pay attention to the people that they were employing. They promoted someone to a department they had zero knowledge of instead of the person that had busted for them for years, taking the courses specifically to move up in the store."
good,"When I worked at Best Buy I never knew when i'd be able to go home. Everyone had to work until the job was done, which took 10+ hours most days. We never knew if we were going to have to work weekends until the last minute. As a temp I was making only 14.00 an hour but that wasn't the company's fault, it was the temp agency I worked for. My supervisor at Best Buy was an understanding guy. During Christmas time, I hardly got 20 hours a week and the shifts were split into two for morning and nights for some reason instead of letting everyone work together like normally."
good,They claim salespeople do not work on commission but if you are not in top sales you do not get any hours. Sales guidelines based on profit measurement. Always forced to sell high-profit items if a customer needs it or not. Told what to sell and what not to sell. Training says to speak with the customer to determine what they need but in truth they want you to sell them the high-profit item. Training not always the best and is based upon influencing you to push the high-profit items.
good,Working at Best Buy was a fun experience. It was my first sales opportunity. I assisted customers with product knowledge and helped them make decisions on devices and insurance protection plans. Made sure store was clean and presentable. I would come in early to restock rack and shelves with products. The management team was also very helpful. Workplace peers were awesome as well. Hardest part of the job was working during Black Friday. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers make the right decision.
good,"Nice people enjoyed working there. Good with scheduling and very flexible. But training is not very good so it gets confusing. Other than that, people were fun and employees and management are very caring."
good,"I liked my job, but they worked us long hours with little breaks. The pay could have been better.  They lay the wrong people off for silly reasons, but keep people who don't want to work and run the clock.  I worked hard and I was always volunteered to stay over help out and be there on holidays extra when people didn't want to be there.  I always worked and helped out.  They lost a good worker. When we had do more then 12 hrs no extra breaks. When it was time to go they keep us extra"
good,"Working at best buy helped me develop skills to talk to people in a more extroverted manner and break me out of my introverted shell. I learned some of the tougher lessons in life that things aren't always fair and that you will have to work hard even when it doesn't benefit you, to advance further in life."
good,"I was hired in at the Scheels location in Reno, NV and they did not give me a schedule. It took them almost 3 weeks for my manager to set up my employee account ( we were not busy ).Only plus side were some staff members were fun to work with."
good,A typical day at work is somewhat monotonous but can become highly stressful. The warehouse was severely understaffed.  I learned to be a good problem solver. Management was very understanding.  There was a good workplace culture everyone got along well. The hardest part of the job was the unreasonableness of the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts.
good,I worked for Best Buy for 8 years.  I started in my early 20's.  The technology sold there and the discounts attract a fun culture of unique individuals who come to work there.  The company hire employees of all ages but leans to a younger group.  Opportunities for advancement  are few and far in-between and while sales goals are tracked and monitored critically these metrics rarely determine who promotes from one role to another. Networking is key to advancement within the company however the  opportunity to network is not offended equally and is often based out of personal relationships rather than professional ones.  It is a fine place to start out and get some sales experience while learning corporate politics but I would not recommend making it a career.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The interview process was pretty simple at Best Buy as long as you show your willing to work they pretty much hire you on the spot. The job itself was pretty straight forward.
good,There is really nothing wonderful to add about a company that does not advance it best employees that have been loyal to the company. I was sad to watch great people walk away after 13 years with the company and not have anything to show.
good,The management at Best Buy was very inconsistent. Also unreliable when asked for at front desk. During busy hours sometimes we were understaffed causing more pressure on employee's hands.
good,If you like people and the retail end of business then it is as good as any I guess. Used to be a lot more variety in the stores now it is getting to be a computer/mobile device outlet.
good,Best Buy is a good place to work while you're finishing high school. The company culture is really casual and the discounts for employees are really good.
good,Best Buy allowed me to advance in the company to a mid level supervisor before it became unbearably political. no matter how much more qualified or better suited I was for a position I was passed up by political favoritism.
good,"Was great, I loved working here, but there came a time where I could not go on living with 8.50/hour especially for how hard I worked. There do not exist any bonuses or extra pay, you get a little and then what you don't spend in the store (employee discount 5% above cost) you are expected to live on."
good,"For what it was, it was a great low pressure job but there was no room to grow as everyone fought for the 1 full time position in our department. This was done so no one qualified for benefits and schedules could be flexible as possible though"
good,"Fair pay, good discounts and easy work, however management is not very personal/professional and stress to sell warranties and credit cards is a constant factor at the job."
good,I had just started out there and it was my very first job. I was supposed to take a 2 weekend training class but they never signed me up for it so I had no training but was still expected to do the job. I learned as I went and was able to be a successful part of the team but it was hard to work there without training.
good,"It's not a forever kind of job in my opinion, it's simply a job. Also it is retail and it is everything you can expect from the retail industry, but nothing above and beyond."
good,"At first the job seems great and the benefits are really attractive, they don't pay bad, however, management is toxic and once people get to a high enough position, they stay there and rarely move because they get complacent."
good,"The Whole place changed when the original Creator was forced out."
good,Best Buy is a well recognized company to work for but the lack of modern technology in their corporate office can definately be revamped. Management had great ideas but poor execution and didn't listen or accept employee input. If they were willing to change the culture it would be a great company to establish an career with.
good,"Every day was different, good for learning new sales skills and learning how to feel comfortable engaging customers."
good,"it was ok, working holidays suck. its was decent other than that. There was alot to do all the time and we had to sell alot of things but that is to be expected."
good,"Unfair wages not comparable to work load, little home/work lif balance hen full time, strict punishments in emergency situation without pro, poor communication with management"
good,"Learned about the electronic and technology industry. Was able to develop my customer service skills and learn different sales tactics. There were decent employee discounts on products. The amount of work I put in to make money for the company was overlooked and unappreciated. With no commission incentives , most employees lack interest to go above and beyond there sales goals."
good,"Sure, it can be faun and neat job. The pay? NOT GOOD. For al the wealth of info that we possessed while working there, we sometimes even trumped the ""pros"" of home theater/cell phones/computers. A lot of customers wondered why we all didn't work in higher paying jobs. How can we if those places don't look at your resume seriously? They think we're minors at any age. Best Buy shoots themselves in the foot here."
good,"clock ,in check in with supervisor and or manager, work the floor, sell ,restock, engage with customers try to meet customer needs and wants, up sell with geek squad plan and credit card enrollment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,My experience at Best Buy is a little different. Working in the install bay is not like working in the store.  Management does not come out and give you a hard time about what you are doing or not doing.  The install bay you just come in and do your work and we always had a good time.
good,"Pretty much what you expect from a minimum wage job. Hours are all over the place, pay is slightly higher than minimum wage. Email collection is very irritating."
good,"positive work environment with much encouragement towards improving your work ethics and skills within the company. "
good,There is no consistency of production and work hours. Some days and weeks you can work 10-12 hours per day and the following days you can only work 2-4 hours per day.
good,"Job is great for school or building a gap between jobs, maybe extra income. Lack of advancement opportunities and worked every weekend, not family friendly"
good,"All you are is a sack of money to your GM, if you're not getting credit card applications or producing a lot of revenue for the store they will not acknowledge you. Other than the General Managers attitudes (I worked at several locations) the place is awesome, you'll have a blast and learn endless possibilities with the latest tech."
good,"A typical work day for me is getting directly to the people and making them feel at ease and okay with spending money with me. I understand it is a great privilege to be handling their business and I act accordingly. I make sure my customers know they can ask me anything and get a solution that will help them best on a day by day. I have learned that I love hitting targets and reaching a goal by its deadline. I love the feeling I have done a good job, help out the customer and hit the sales target. The work culture is well represented and noticeable connects personal values within the company. The hardest part of my Job was not being good at saying no to new task as the most enjoyable was challenging myself with these task accomplishing the task head on."
good,working for Best Buy i learned to have patience and always be customer first. Most of the management were disorganized. The work culture was unprofessional. The most challenging part of working for best buy was the lack of training. The most enjoyable part was helping customers meet their needs.
good,The co-workers were enjoyable. Management was difficult to deal with at times. The emphasis on getting the additional protection plans made selling a little harder.
good,"Best But is mainly for college kids. It was hard working there as an adult because you had to catch up the slack of the college kids who didn't really have to work. Advancement or promotions were not based on work ethic or seniority, but more of who you are. Annual raises were a joke, I worked there 5 years and outside of switching jobs roles, each annual raise was less than a quarter."
good,"The corporate culture could be extremely difficult to deal with. Layoffs and reorganizations are a constant occurrence, and there has been an ongoing effort to drive the bottom line by cutting expenses (people), while top line sales remain more or less stagnant. While this helps keep Wall Street interested, it does so at the expense of employee's mental health and engagement. After surviving through many years of reorganizations (and getting cut, then rehired), I was very pleased to leave on my own terms for a company that isn't constantly reducing headcount."
good,learned a lot from this company but upper management has a lot to work on and we get over worked with no reason the customers where very nice and team was awesome and I enjoyed that part of my job.
good,The pay is competitive the only downfall is that it is a branch management system. So depending on the shift you are working you have to constantly know how to deal with issues that arise and in what order work needs to get done depending on the level of importance the manager you are working with places on the tasks.
good,"If you love interacting with people and staying up to date on the latest technology, then you'd most likely enjoy working at Best Buy.  This is retail--so long hours during the holiday season, plus a big push from management on your numbers are to be expected.  Your work group (coworkers and managers) can either make thinks enjoyable or make things stink.  The discounts are really great though."
good,"This position was only for Christmas rush, & we were treated as such.  Didn't care about any of us and it showed.  Workers didn't get along either to begin with."
good,It was in the early years of expantion and all they cared about was warrenties ESP's   if you could not sell a high enough persent you were fired I hated it
good,"The entire job of a sales associate was to say absolutely anything to get a customer to walk out with anything. As a direct competitor to Amazon, they knew that they couldn't compete on price so that the compensation was supposed to be customer service. Instead, this usually meant lying to old people to get them to buy computers that were way too expensive for their needs."
good,I sold computers and learned a lot on the job.  The company dedicates sufficient on the job technical training and continuously helped improve employee knowledge.
good,its ok to work there if your a teenager!!!!!!!!! if your older not so great no advancement really.if you have a opinion you will never advance!!!!!!!!
good,"starts as a positive environment but slowly you will turn to dislike the company. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working for Best Buy was a decent job on a temporary level, I could see the benefits of working there in a more permanent capacity but I was not there long enough."
good,"As loss prevention most companies are concerned about limiting shortage in some form or another, but not this one. Asset protection is basically a term for a do all position that is still expected to make the impossible happen. Shortage occurred more through intangible operational issues and poor management decisions yet the Asset Protection team got hung out to dry for these issues regardless. If you can get past being blamed for all that is wrong in the store, the job itself is pretty simple; stand at the front of the store and greet or help process store shipments. Definitely not what I was told it would be when hired."
good,The job was Ok. Management was lacking in many ways and the pay wasn't the best. I barely survived on the pay. The info was easy to learn. I personally wouldn't go back to retail.
good,"Weak compensation with not bonuses or commission.  No family work balance!!! Great company to start off with and have on the resume though.  You will learn a great deal about sales, customer service and technology!!"
good,"honestly a truly fun place to work, and is a very fast pace environment for most days.  If you pick things up quick this would be a great place to work.  Culture is vast consisting of associates of all ages."
good,"While the interaction with customers is pleasant, beyond that, there is little to no job culture at BestBuy. Employee training is deplorable considering the vast amount of knowledge you need to absorb."
good,Lots of employees different attitudes fast paced not climate controled parking was awful HR wasn't very helpful loss of work and hr many times communication was non existent
good,"Nothing special around this establishment."
good,Changed policies and had unstable computer systems. The phone were not good either. Always dropping calls when trasferring. Not enough employees to handle calls and not enough training for seasonal employees
good,Job is high stress and has a very low pay rate. This is a good job for someone in high school or without a degree to gain some experience but nothing more. High turnover rate and you are expected to hot sales goals without commission
good,"The general day to day work is rather boring and repetitive without any real benefits gained from it. I am lucky enough to work with great people, otherwise I would most likely not be working there anymore."
good,"Work friendly, my day consists of truck check in as soon as a arrive, that is always priority, we double check appliances to make sure they're new and in case of a unit being defective we tag it as SERVICE, if unit damage we proceed to tag it as an OPBX. after truck check in we do billing, which consist of billing the customer for the piece they purchase unless it was returned, if the unit returned we make sure customer doesn't get bill for a piece they do not have. once billing is done we continue to do cancels/reschedules, which means if customer wasn't at home, we contact them for a new delivery date. After, i do  ORD and SERVICE."
good,I was a phone sales rep for bestbuy (NCO). This was a very fastpaced cut throat work environment. The pay was the lowest that i've ever received and it was like pulling teeth  trying to get time off. i would only recommend this place if you have absolutely no other options.
good,"A metric-focused, yesman-driven workplace. As with any other farming position, you will live and die by your metrics unless you are chummy with your direct manager and ""network"" appropriately."
good,over all best buy is good however management can be a lot better. discount is good. not really much to say only management sucks and needs a lot of working on
good,"Best Buy was my first job many years ago, and i remember at the beginning loving it. But then it stiopped being sio muchfun and maangements became less and less friendly."
good,"So it's a fun place to work if you're just looking for a paycheck. Favoritism is rampant in all of the stores. Sales employees aren't commissioned based, but they are tracked. If they aren't performing to the standards of their set IST, their jobs are threatened. It's virtually impossible to advance in this company, so be warned of that."
good,warehouse work. job was good. didn't like working second shift. management needs improvement. pay was low. no advancement. co workers didn't help each other. supervisor didn't treat everyone fair.
good,"Best Buy was my first job, and I was there for a couple of years. It was stressful when we were required to work 12+ hour days around the holidays with occasional rude customers. Once the holiday season was over, they cut everyone's hours back to very low if you were not a full time employee. For a while, the cashiers including myself were only receiving 4 hours per week. I have not worked there in a while, so hopefully things have changed. But it wasn't even worth the drive to the store for 4 hours per week."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management is wishy washy and play favorites. Jobs may vary, depending on if any work is available. good hours to work monday through friday. Production is low and hard to get 40 hours a week."
good,"I enjoyed showing customers the newest technology.  From tablets, to computers, even phones, it was cool seeing the customers face light up when they found out that they can work the latest iPhone or android."
good,Learned how to deal with conflict on a daily basis as it involved dealing with angry customers. Commission structure and work perks were good. Management team kept changing.
good,"Very slow but if you know how to speak more than one language, its very beneficial & you could learn new things by getting to know other departments. Really cool atmosphere"
good,"Best Buy is a great environment to dip your toe in the retail world. Especially for students who are struggling, this is a great job because of the flexible hours and sales skills you have to obtain and execute."
good,"I am always on call. I am never off work. I am only a lead and its not worth the stress. My manager is amazing but it is not worth it. Also, working in the mall location is horrible. The people you encounter are insane and trashy."
good,"Working at Best Buy is of course, retail, but albeit it was pretty darn fun to work there. They have really decent benefits, 401k pay-in, and the option for advancement if you so choose. It pays okay hourly, and if your store can reach their goals, you have a chance to make more in bonuses after you've been there  a while (5+months.) Everyone freaks out about the discount, but you really only save on accessories and small stuff; you're not gonna get a 4ktv or a MacBook for 50% of the original price. It's more like, a $20 phone charger will be $.88 ."
good,"Job is stressful and not worth what they pay, little to no opportunity for advancement. Lack of communication from management with contradicting instructions. Co workers were great, only reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"It was a pleasure to have witnessed the structure of a company that has done this well. Best Buy is true to their pledge to have knowledgeable employees. Their training process is intense, but it does stick. Wasn't at all pleased by my higher ups. Really caddy unfeeling managers- were all about rev. no matter what (literally no matter what, got written up for going to go tend to a sick family member mid shift... found out later that it was illegal for me to have been written up.) Thanks for the tech. education, but nah.."
good,"I loved my job at Best Buy!  Started off in inventory within a few months I was moved to sales.  After a year in sales I was promoted to Lead.  Then the new GM came in and ruined for everyone.  When you are told: ""When you enter this building I OWN YOU""  you kind of lose respect for people.  Some of the managers were absolutely wonderful, some seemed like they were there for a paycheck.  They give you all the tools you need to succeed, they just dropped the ball with this new GM hire."
good,"A great environment to work in, but the hours have been cut and the hours are never reliable anymore. The other co-workers, including management are all very nice, and make it a fun place to work."
good,It is a great place to work with if you are a college student. They try to accommodate to your schedule but it all depends on who the management is. As a part time hire however be aware that hours can change drastically - you can get 30 hours one week and the next month you'll only have 4 hours every 2 weeks
good,"Not much room for advancement, despite how everything looks. If you are at the bottom, that's where you'll stay. Bosses may offer you positions but then give them to someone else abruptly."
good,"Coworkers were always great, but the company is quickly becoming obsessed with micromanaging employees. If you're not a direct sales associate, the company does little to encourage enthusiasm in the work place. Benefits were decent, but pay was not competitive. No room for growth in store, unless someone quit or transfered stores."
good,"It was pretty clear from the get-go that I was only there to help with Black Friday. I got the feeling that the entire experience was geared towards 'just keep customers busy and stock shelves while the employees who know things are helping other customers'. "
good,it was good until they began taking advantage and basically told me to choose between school or work. they asked if i wanted to work full time instead of part time and stop going to school full time which was never going to happen
good,"Management is iffy they promise you things they can't back up...The team is GREAT, people are always friendly. The place has great structure it's a team first environment for sure, the management just kind of treats you as if it's your last day there and that they will be fine without you..they make you feel expendable, don't appreciate your hard work. And if they don't like you they just won't talk to you. It will be just you and your favorite co workers against the management."
good,"MCSA position was eliminated.  It consisted of sitting at a desk, answering calls, and working customer pickup. The management wasn't understanding of my personal situation.  The discount was nice, but there weren't benefits for part time."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A solid entry level job which will give you a lot of valuable experience. Compensation at the location I worked in was rather poor, and advancement even for great employees was kind of vague and difficult to attain."
good,i think its comfortable working at best buy. they're lenient for the most part but I hate that the managers dont know how to enforce rules correctly. They also feel like they can just tell you wha to do bc of their title.
good,"Good place, but very poor compensation.  Roughly half of what compensation a decent employee would be worth for the work.  Temp agency made sure to prevent full time."
good,"Depending on who your Store Manager is, you can have the best time of your life, or the worst."
good,"Although the company's policies and procedures are commendable and allow for opportunity to move up, at each store I have worked at, (on both sides of the country)... the management team has been dishonest, unsupportive and had a very quick turnover rate."
good,"It is a good job if you are still in school, as a stepping stone or for some extra cash but definitely not something to stay with and do for the rest of your life."
good,"Management is entirely too clingy, yet did a terrible job with training. I learned to be self-sufficient and to not expect help. The work place culture is spelled out in black and white but the management team dealt in a grey area. The hardest part of this job is getting proper development. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers."
good,Teaches you a lot about technologies for home and personal use. It is a job while in college but not forever. Sales goals and pressure is not compensated enough while employees put in over 40 hrs over work a week.
good,"This is a job for someone who is serious about the items sold in the store, or for a college kid that needs some extra income for school.  The management is cool and the workers are ok."
good,"This was a good place to work, but after the holiday season they cut hours and you have to stick to it or find other work.  I did learn a lot about the selling aspect of electronics"
good,"In most Best Buy positions, the role is basically spinning the wheel so the cogs of the giant corporate retail machine keep going. They mostly let younger kids and has-beens enjoy their work time and have a fun environment."
good,ok place to work management is over bearing and is always wanting you to sell like you are on commission and stalk customers and sell everything to everyone
good,"co-workers care about each other, Management is okay but needs improvement. When not obsessing about Revenue goals and Credit card application, Best Buy could be a very great place to work."
good,"security, made sure no customers/ employees stole merchandise would much rather being on the floor and get into sales, bad and poor managers who have poor manger skills."
good,if you are a young adult looking for a fun job that allow flexibility in your schedule best buy is the place for you .Remember this is a retail chain and weekends are a must
good,"If you're wanting a fun retail job, for the most part, this would be your place to go. However, if you get hired on as a part timer, you might have a very difficult time trying to advance in your career. Depending on your manager, you may or may not enjoy the work environment. Most of the time, your co-workers are team oriented, but it can be very frustrating some days more than others."
good,"I met lots of cool people there. "
good,"There was always more responsibility than pay, they wanted you to worked your tail off for just about minimum wage. I loved my co workers, and some of my managers, but that's anywhere you work. I just was generally unhappy, we never received those bonuses they always pushed us to get our numbers for, I was there for 3 years and only received 1 pay increase."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,There are a lot of changes going on and makes the work place dysfunctional. Leadership is a joke and but I guess they are doing the best they can with what they have to work with.
good,"I enjoyed most of my career at Best Buy. I was promoted to the high possible paid position in the store outside of management. Good job, good coworkers, bad managers. Best Buy's local management was notoriously apathetic, very much a ""if it's not my problem"" attitude. This sour stain on positive memories of teamwork with coworkers, that arose from unrealistic expectations from management, unwilling to address the specific problems in departments. Employees are afraid to bring up issues with management for fear of repercussion. Internal politics play a all too important role in the day to day, and bigger picture of the store that I worked at. Unfortunate considering that the companies SOP painted a working picture of the way in which the departments should run, was disregarded for selfish means. Major staffing problems and impressive employee turnover. So much so that multiple people I had worked with, continued to stay on the books until the next year, as not the raise the GM's turnover rate."
good,Starbucks was a decent place to pick up some extra income while I was in school but the management brought down the quality of the workplace culture. Hours were very hard to get and expectations were extremely high. Pay was mediocre.
good,"I am not here to tell how my experience was with best buy, if you want to know go apply at some temp agency best buy is always hiring temps but watch out because you work there for 6 months+ then get fired because your on the bottom of totem pole."
good,This is a great job with plenty of opportunity for advancement but there are poor leaders who contribute to already low morale of all the workers. It's kind of 50/50
good,they treat their employees like machines and not people here.  The deceitful and charismatic always move up in this company and the righteous hard working people only seem to move down or stay in the same place.  This company is only looking for the fastest way to make a buck and doesn't truly care about their employees or their customers.
good,"Wasn't my favorite place to work but it wasn't too horrible. The management was terrible and didn't help the representatives when needed. Also, didn't keep their promise to hire me on full-time after the holiday season like they said they intended to do. But, my other representatives were awesome and the geek squad was great & extremely helpful."
good,"There are better places to work at, if you don't want to sign a contract each year. The environment is boring and monotonous. However, it is well organized."
good,"Working at best buy is fun mostly because the coworkers. however, the mangers are insanely corrupt. I had promise to move to geek squad, but since a manager didnt like me, I can no longer go there. this manger harasses people, sexually assaults them, and discriminates. For a highschooler or someone that just needs work its okay. But long term, no thanks,."
good,"The job at Best Buy in the warehouse was easy, easy to learn and safe, but the management made it a bad workplace, not for the pressure or the job itself,  but the supervisor of the warehouse was rude since the first day, knowledgeable of the position, but incapable of directing the employees, always in a rude way and not understandable, provoking during my four months in there, the turnover of five employees of the warehouse. The GM, good person but did not do anything about it, and by personal chats with some of the other department´s workers, they were also not happy in the store. The assistant manager, in my opinion did not help to make things better, but had an undeniable strong desire to improve the selling part of the store, not the environment of the store."
good,There are a lot of good reasons to work for Best Buy. I can't say that my overall experience was terrible. At the end of my employment however I become aware of shady company practices and was forced out for trying to blow the whistle.
good,its a good job when you are still in school very flexible. It has up and downs at the time the managers and supervisors where no agreeing in several stuff and managers having preferences with people
good,"Only cared about sales, not what was right for customers needs. Most coworkers worked as if they were on commission and many customers left with wrong product because associates were not properly trained."
good,"Every morning there are 'meetings' that let you know your estimated day length, any important information, and your job location for the day. After the meeting, you promptly begin work until everything is done, including helping other coworkers. "
good,"this job is perfect for someone who is either working through college, or has a second job. but its not career worthy. the only way it would be career worthy is if you became a general manager or above."
good,"I worked at bestbuy a while ago, it was an alright job, I made lots of friends at work and got along well with most of the management. I worked in the warehouse, which was enjoyable for me because I mostly worked nights, usually quite independently since most of the warehouse work was done in the morning. I spent a lot of time alphabetizing dvds, stocking product, and sometimes working the door, doing security. I found the work itself to be easy but not so mindless that I got really bored. One of the things I really didn't like was the way the management was set up, I found there to be way too many levels of management, supervisors, team leads, managers, assistant managers, its like they were trying really hard to make people feel important but it ended up being confusing and often kind of patronizing, I was lucky to work nights, when I did have a dayshift I often felt like I was being micromanaged, half the time by more than one person telling me to do different things and never really communicating with each other. The job culture was a little too aggressive for my liking as well,  I remember being sick with a sore throat one saturday morning and getting yelled at in front of everybody because I didn't participate in the morning cheer (which I thought was kind of stupid anyway, to be honest). Lastly, I had a friend who worked in the future shop warehouse at around the same time, at future shop, the warehouse people wore plain black polo shirts so customers would know they weren't salespeople, but at bestbuy the only thing separating us from the salespeople was that we were"
good,You wont get paid what you're worth. The clients can be really rude and some of the issues are more above the pay grade. The typical retail hours are expected too.
good,"A typical day shift would start with checking email to find out any important information, then I would check the previous day's business results to see if we had a good day or not and see what we can repeat or change for this day, all the while starting a list of things to accomplish for that day. Next up, I would prepare for the daily huddle to share with the store team any important info, go over business results and get their input on what our store goals should be for that day. After the huddle, but before the store opens, I would walk the store to see if there are any merchandising issues that need to be considered, adding them to my list, while greeting all the employees and making sure we have adequate staffing for the day. After the walk, I start on my to do list, delegating what I can, and following up on the things previously delegated. I make sure to stay accessible, either on the floor or observing interactions to get a sense of employee engagement and to know where I may be needed. Every hour up to about 2 pm,I check numbers to see where the store stands with sales.Any areas that are doing well I congratulate, and those doing poorly I go and see what can be done to raise the numbers up.After 2 pm, I spend the rest of my time in  my departments making sure that I am sharing information, training, observing sales interactions, coaching as well as checking pricing ,inventory and merchandising standards.-- This job was difficult and Best Buy created this position in the early 2000's and got rid of this position soon afterward. I believe it was a way to downsize, by"
good,"Management plays favorites and selects certain employees over others. Will degrade other employees when they do bad, but not reward when they do good"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Could be a really great company, if they paid a living wage and also helped people work up in the company. Coworkers are enjoyable to work with."
good,Geek Squad has changed their model for customer engagement multiple times in the 3 years I have been there. When the company started doing well again they changed their main product to be less friendly to customers.
good,Treats their employees terribly. Not afraid to randomly cut hours. You barely make ends meats. Only for high school or beginning college students. Upper management does not care about you at all.
good,"In the mornings all paper work would be printed out, new tags were printed for the new product. What I have learned over the past seven and a half years is that technology is always changing, there will always be something new to be put out. The management doesn't communicate with the store employees. There should have been much more communication with the warehouse employees and management. The coworkers were easy to get along with. The jobs weren't always done 100% by the store due to the lack of management. What I enjoyed most about the job was the hours and learning about the new technology that was coming out. The hardest part of the job was having to do the scope of two different stores in less than the scheduled time."
good,If you don't say hello to people in the morning they do not want you working for their store. job consist of mostly placing up displays such as mounting new tv displays for customers in the store. Typically start a few hours before stores open just so that most of the displays are up before hand.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of mostly stocking items and occasionally going to the floor to look for things customers ordered online. I learned how to search items online using a SKU number. My co-workers were the best part, as everyone was pretty social. We would go out to lunch together and take breaks together. Sometimes, I had a difficult time finding certain products."
good,"A typical day consisted of repairing most drop offs, sending some drop offs back to the manufacturer for repairs if working on the unit could potentially void a warranty. I learned the ins and outs of installing hardware and firmware on both Desktop and Notebook PCs."
good,"Training was non-existent. Sink or swim environment. Good for some, not for others. Difficulties getting assistance from managers when clients want to escalate. Coaching/feedback is not consistent. Schedules were all over the place/you may start work at 6 a.m one day, and 10 p.m. the next day."
good,THis place is full of childish games and nonsense. The lazy workers are rewarded and the hard workers are frowned upon. If you have a good work ethic and prefer to do a good job....then don;t work here.
good,"Great Experience, learned about new technology everyday and got to review many products. Wonderful people to work with. I've learned all about different cellphone carriers, and different phones. Its great getting to work with customers personally everyday."
good,I got laid off due to business being very slow. It was good for the first month and a half but after that work died down. There was barely anything for anyone to do so some employees had to go home early.
good,Good company to work for. Only had a seasonal job so unsure about the benefits. Wish i would have had a little better training. Other then that when i needed help the mangers made sure they did to the best of their abilities.
good,i really don't get many hours. the managers are pret.ty cool but the hours suck. some people might like if you get enough hours but i feel like i could work for minimum wage and get more hours and make the same paycheck.
good,Great place to work. No harsh commission sales. Focus is on putting the right product in the customer lifestyle the fits their needs.
good,"My typical day at work involves managing the Microsoft Windows Store by delegating, supervising, and coaching the connected solutions sales staff. Responding to customers needs and concerns relating to Microsoft products that are sold by Best Buy."
good,"Initially I really liked this job but that fondness faded quickly. A typical day at work would be to greet customers and monitor my area. I had a set amount of money in merchandise I had to sell along with having to sell the company credit card and product protection. I really liked that it was laid back, and I liked that I pretty much chose when I wanted to take my break and my coworkers were cool for the most part but I was always in competition it seemed like. There was always someone, who had been there longer, trying to take a sale from me and I was often lied to for tricked so they could gain from it. I also hardly ever got any hours. I maxed out at maybe 12-15 hours per week.I was always given an excuse for why I couldn't get more hours when it seemed like everyone else would be getting good hours. The discount was also mediocre. There was no set percentage you got like most retail stores and many items in he store weren't eligible for employee discount. I didn't really care for that. I didn't have too bad of an experience but I don't see myself working for Best Buy again."
good,I learned how to operate cash registers and create guest accounts for geek squad repairs and operations. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help set up for black Friday sales as well as creating sales racks for special products for sale. I also enjoyed the friendly competition for the offering guest the opportunity to sign up for a best buy credit card.
good,"I began as a consultant on the sales floor, to later become a GeekSquad agent.  My responsibilities ranged from hardware and software repairs on both PC and MAC, to signing customers up for our protection investment plans. i also once traveled to represent the geeksquad at an AARP convention to promote our tech services"
good,"With any position at Bestbuy you have constant training on the newest features and products out on the market and how to troubleshoot for customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good if you can sell at a cash register, bad if you are not naturally good at it. This was my first and probably last time I would work at Best Buy, sometimes it's good being on the opposite side shopping there instead of working there. The people always make or break the workplace, I was fortunate to have a real good group of people but management wants more and more. I asked to be move to a better position than I had but was denied. I felt like I was setup to fail."
good,"I was on fmla and tree months later tey fired me,saying I did not get aporve for my fmla and I did.they have three different dates and then Chickasaw clinic would not sign my paper work so they let me go."
good,"A difficult company to move up with.  No accountability held for managers and upper management.  The company says they want you to excel yourself and proclaims they will help if you are going to school.  This is not the case, they will cut hours and benefits to get you to leave."
good,"Immature and judgmental staff, always rushed to finish tasks with perfection. Management is strict and somewhat supportive."
good,At this job there was not enough room for advancement. This job hired many high school students so the work atmosphere was not always pleasant.
good,"The review summary says it all! Loved working with my peers, however the lack of efficiency and favoritism from managers and upper- management was very apparent."
good,"Management typically has a lot of favoritism so unless you're on their good side you basically get shafted every time with either terrible shifts or that your needs may came second compared to others. Full Time benefits are awesome, people are great and it's a easy job that you rarely feel like work but more like you're just helping out someone you know."
good,"The co-workers were absolutely fantastic but the management was quite underhanded and they would do anything to make sure their own position was secure. "
good,"after the company almost tanked the new CEO came in decided to get us on track but robotically. There was no work / life balance. You get emails on vacation, during funerals, having a baby, etc. They didn't not care anymore about the employees it was all about the money. To get to the top and to stay relevant. Stocks shot up, turnover shot up, and verbal abuse from DM's shot up. Became a very dark miserable place to work."
good,"Typical Day: For me I get to work 2-3 hours before the store opens to complete functionality (Assessing returned products for resale.) As I continue functionality through the day I file reports on client products being worked on in-store, answer phones, and help clients at the front counter. "
good,"Maintained clean and orderly checkout areas in order to provide fast and courteous customer service."
good,"I maintain a cash drawer and ring up customers with their purchases. I am responsible for assisting all walk in customers, assist with product knowledge and presentation.  I am responsible for maintaining a clean safe working area, and maintaining stock levels. I am also responsible for letting the customers know about warranty information and if available offering extended warranties and insurance. I maintain a cash drawer and ring up customers with their purchases."
good,"My time at Geek Squad allowed me to fulfill many different roles and responsibilities within both retail oriented duties and services. I was expected to not only provide friendly and considerate services to Geek Squad customers looking for help with their devices, but also general Best Buy customers through the customer service counter. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales demands for services and convincing clients to purchase subscriptions with Geek Squad for ongoing support. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a client's smiling face when they received back their computer or other device in pristine, working order."
good,When I left the company in 2010 they were in a transitional phase that they still seem to be in. Fortunately they appear to be moving in the right direction.
good,"Can be fun depending on the members on your team."
good,"hitting quotas, crunching numbers, angry customers. all because their electronics don't work, simply because they do not know how to use them. story of every best buy employee's life."
good,management was not good at all at this location. customers could be very aggressive and verbally abusive. The pay was ok but had little to no benefits. it had good discounts for employees.
good,"First off forgive my grammar. After one year working with the company i have had some really great times, and really not so great times. i made some really cool friends and some members of management was nice and worked really well and wanted to get to know you. but then you have the managers where their only nature is to keep themselves in a reclusive state, and will completely f**k your schedule unless you re a top selling associate. they do not see it as what the associates have to offer but only what associates sell the most. one of my supervisors would completely lie to customers to get sales out of them. i have even been victim to one of my managers lying to me about a saving i would get on a new electric range i purchased with my employee discount. I have always gotten positive feedback from my customers, even if i never sold them anything the knowledge i would pass on to them was enough to get them excited about certain products or help them understand how certain things worked. although that was not appreciated by my managers and they only were interested in how much you sold to customers. and if you didnt sell well enough they will starve you and your family by giving you as little hours as possible. you would think fir being such a numbers driven establishment they should know you are not going to sell much on an average Monday morning. after quitting my job i feel alot less stressed out. after one year of putting my all into this job by researching new products coming out and studying the products the company sells and never getting anything in return other than"
good,"A typical day in the life of a Geek Squad Online Support Fulfillment agent is hectic and the agent can be left with a feeling of dissatisfaction by the end of the workday. A fulfillment agent is the agent whom actually works on a client's computer and ""fulfills"" upon the work set forth by our dispatch agents. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Poor hours and pay but fun to work there. Boulder especially was great as we were a brand new store so the team was very tight.
good,If you're a student its a great place to work because they have a reimbursement program and they will work around your school schedule
good,"The job is really easy and management is very lax, but this job is like going to high school but worse. Everyone there is two-faced and will talk about you behind your back or start a rumor about you at their first opportunity, even if they know it's not true. There is a lot of drama. However, it does pay very well."
good,"I was a Geek Squad Service Agent. I had quite a few responsibilities, but most dealt with customer service. I handled a lot of returns and credit card applications. I was able to coordinate some classes per se, that helped consumers achieve what they were looking for in their electronics. I diagnosed issues with computers, tablets and gaming software. The best part of this was learning, especially being tech savvy, you get to allow yourself to learn more and address that knowledge to help others. Management was decent. I didn't much interaction with management other than my supervisor. Your supervisor will depend on how you enjoy your job. Fortunately for myself, I enjoyed it very much. He made it a fun work environment and stuck up for his team. The hardest part of this job is handling with irritable customer regarding their product that needs to be serviced or if they are returning their product because of dissatisfaction."
good,Working at best buy would have been a lot better if management was more helpful when it comes to training and a lot more friendly
good,Over the years BestBuy has changed greatly. The changes they are making are intended to better the company while having a positive effect on the employees. All companies go through change; it is to be expected. The loss of culture and good management is not to be expected. This company has incredibly high turn-over rates. The family it once had is no longer there. It is not fun anymore and the managers are uninvolved.
good,"For the most part, I loved my time with best buy. As time passed the culture changed as the company seemed more focused on maximizing revenue per client with no regard to whether or not the solution best met the clients need. As this culture began to manifest, it caused a very tense work environment and led to some (in my opinion) questionable hiring/firing of leadership that was in place. Managers with very questionable methods were put in place of managers who genuinely cared about the client experience and best buy ""core values"". With a much more competitive aura within departments and management making terrible decisions and hiring/firing with questionable methods/reasoning it made the day to day experience one I would not recommend to anyone. Helping clients is the most enjoyable and the most difficult part of the day depending on your demeanor and ability to turn negative experiences into good ones. With the current direction of the company it seems the poor management in place will only increase. All in all, it used to be a fantastic company to work for and advance in. Currently, Best Buy is an organization I would avoid at all costs."
good,wasn't the best experience but i made the best of it. people there were fun and cool to work with. supervisors of some departments were snobs and didn't help much when needed.
good,"I have recently found out that the store i work at is the 2nd lowest paid in the district, and on top of that, the worst when it comes to employee relations. The management will dump on you in an instant and expects you to put any family aside for the buisness."
good,"Working for this company I learned that most of the managers have less knowledge of the field they work in then the employees that actually do the work. The management team should be a able to do all the work that the employees are capable of doing. "
good,The work its self wasn't hard or complicated and the learning curve is easy management could get worked up over stupid things and often would be a little oppressive and there was definite favoritism towards some employees. the hardest part of the job was probably that it was expected to be the most important part of your life and that everything else was less important or not important. the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people you work with you will meat some interesting characters
good,Working for Best Buy was an interesting experience.  You had to make the best of each day. My co-workers were the best part of the job.  I did not agree with some policies and procedures.
good,"A lot of the management had great intentions and were not bad people, but they managed very poorly. I was told I would have opportunity to move up, but the management do nothing to insure those possibilities."
good,"Normally  busy coworkers  are fun management  need a of work, communication  is horrible"
good,"Communication between staff and management is terrible. Threw me right onto the floor to ""shadow"" people and had to take online training. I know about most of the products because I'm a computer enthusiast but without that knowledge I would have known nothing."
good,"No room for promotions, A lot of favoritism and lack of experienced leadership"
good,The job doesn't allow associates to be paid well for whats expected of them
good,"Honestly working for Best Buy in the beginning was a blast and management was just so fun to work around, however, after a while they didn't treat me the same."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fast paced work environment that stretches ones thinking capacity but has inconsistent work hours which make it difficult to balance work and life events
good,Very fast paced. Spent one hundred percent of the time doing installations and than moving on to the next one right afterwards.
good,Worked at the customer service desk. Management tells use to say no once its out the return policy when people kick and scream and ask for management they would say yes having the customers think we were just giving them a hard time.
good,The culture of delivering the best customer service experience possible is extremely rewarding.
good,"The benefits are great(discounts, 401K, stock purchase, health)."
good,Over all BestBuy was a fun place to work... They always had training that let you learn and the people were always having fun and joking around... would have stayed if they did not keep cutting hours... one week you work 40+ then drop you down to 20... was not a place for steady income
good,"Great for part time and making a bit of money for fun."
good,One thing about this job is that you're so busy that time fly by.  I really learned how to handle dealing with multiple tasks and customers simultaneously.  The management was decent and co-workers were very helpful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is becoming open to customers especially for a person like myself.
good,Too much work not able to handle . Too much service call on a given day not able to keep up with time frame and customer interaction
good,"Flexible with schedules, people that work here are passionate, but alos a lot of complainers and lazy people not held accountable for severely sub standard performance."
good,"We had a lot of fun working together but for no reason, people who you act like your friends will stab you in the back and create untrue rumors. Management was okay, but there were a couple who treated you like you were not good enough or smart enough. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay out of the gossip. The most enjoyable part was doing the actual job of a customer service agent."
good,"Working at Best Buy Tallahassee, was a good and bad experience all in one. There were times where I really loved coming to work and wanted to be at work. Then there was times to where I was like I did not like the work environment any longer due to the way I was being treated and other employees. It was as if my Supervisor would not acknowledge the hard working employees and only award the ones who would not do any work at all. What I liked about Best Buy at first was that I was able to help people get what they wanted and make them happy. I was never given a bad report off of my behavior only bad report would be long lines, but that was only due to the store being super busy and I being the only working person."
good,Job security was the biggest concern while working here. Many of the new hires are hired on three month contracts and there is no communication on renewal status beforehand.
good,At work on a normal day I would help keep everything neat and help customers find the right tablet or computer for them. I learned a lot about computers and tablets and what is better than the rest. My co-workers were nice and sometimes fun. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy customers who yelled at me for someone else's mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job was having my customers leaving with the product they wanted completely satisfied.
good,"Work culture depends on your manager/director.  Some departments are still employee focused, but many have moved to share holder focused."
good,"The job was okay, but there idea for sales was silly, writing down what the customer wants on a piece of paper like some car salesman, when you can obviously see the customer was irritated, the management acted to much like teenagers and kind of lazy not really there for the customer. Co-worker where good, always did there part. The hardest part of the job, the higher ups, most enjoyable, the customer."
good,"Job was fun great to get through college, flexible and had good benefits for full timers.  But not very rewarding to work here.  Constant downsizing and pay cuts.  Employees feel very unvalued here."
good,"Used to be a fun place, unfortunately the changes that have taken place since 2007 made it much more stressful and less about the customer experience."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"more input is needed from low level employees, middle management in my experience is anything but productive."
good,"On a daily basis, I interact with between 20-40 customers. As a consultation agent, I spend a lot of time trying to determine exactly what would be the best solution for my customers' issues and if Geek Squad provides a service that would be helpful to them. My coworkers are very helpful but the management is not. If possible, they will not address customer issues and make it hard for us to enforce customer policies. In the past year, I've learned a lot about consumer electronics and gained better customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to teach my customers how to use their products efficiently and making technology less frustrating for older generations."
good,"My typical day at work is enjoyable teaching new computer users how to navigate for the first time, and its also enjoyable to talk to those who want to learn more about there computer. There is a high volume of customers who come in the store for repair work and who like to call for technical support, i am in charge of various duties. There isn't really anything i am not capable of assisting with and that I struggle with, except giving customers bad news that there unit they had for over 10 years should be replaced with something new. That is far most the hardest part, however the most enjoyable part of my job is that i get to bike to work everyday and most of my department rides to work as well. We have a great community of cyclist at my work. I have learned to be patient, I learn something new everyday. The technology is growing and part of my job is to keep updated with the latest news and updates, which is also fun to learn."
good,I enjoy working for Best Buy.  I have learned alot about electronics.  Most of my co-workers like thier jobs.  The are re-organizing the managers right now.  I would say the hardest part of my job right now is working six days aweek.  The most enjoyable is what I do.  I enjoy counting and pushing paper!
good,"My usualy day at Best Buy, when not assisting customers with needs and questions, would consist of mecchandising, inverntory, organization of multiple departments. I learned alot more about selling and phrasing and customer intereaction. Management was for the most part good. My co-workers were all friends. I did not really find any part of the job that difficult. My Favorite part of the job assisting the customers and helping them meet their needs."
good,"If you like physical labour, this is a decent job to have. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are shuttle days where you are required to unload various service center, appliance, and TV shipments and then load service center and haul-away shipments. Thursdays are restocking days where you unload the main truck and restock the store. On this subject, working on the truck is a major team effort and communication is vital in order to ensure maximum efficiency."
good,"no commision, very high deman job, must meet quota, management often favours certain individauls, must be able to handle pressure, and okay pay."
good,"The people and the learning experience were great. But the management system was the worse I ever worked for. Never following policy, always making exceptions for people who didnt read the return exchange policy and who didnt take advice on what they need and what they should do. I loved my fellow employees but hated my managers."
good,"Recent executive changes over the past 2 years have helped turn around a lot of the legacy old school thinking at Best Buy but they have a long way to go. There is a lot of corporate 'red tape' to battle through whenever process changes/improvements are suggested. There were months where I would average 6 hours of meetings per day. (and half the participants would be on their laptops/phones multitasking) This would lead to reoccurring meetings on the same subjects rehashing conversations with little to no progress on actual work."
good,Very vibrant atmosphere. Great opportunities to learn indepth information about the products we are selling.
good,"I loved working with the employees and the customers."
good,Every store is different.  Employees need stronger leadership.
good,This job can be fun and challenging. Do not expect much pay for the work though.
good,"I would go in to work and we exercise before we would go to our jobs , be assigned an area to work in and collect all the orders in the area for the day . Management was very unorganized. Another diversity company and people had there own way of getting through there day. The hardest part of my day was climbing stairs all day long with only a 15 minute break. The most enjoyable was the end of the day when I could go home and made me money."
good,"It's fun and all, but the management could be a little bit more respectful and nicer. No arrogance needed or anything like that.  I sell phones, upgrades and such, but help out in most departments when needed."
good,"I really enjoy this job because it surrounds you in most current technologies. A regular day is making every customer doesn't go unserved and making sure department is upstocked and clean. Some co-workers are fun and work while some just slack. Management is very lenient. For example, 15 workers called in and they didn't get a slap on the wrist. The hardest part of this job would have to be the customers because every customer interaction is different."
good,"While the Geek Squad members are quite competent, the management focuses on sales, not repair."
good,"From the start of my day I tend to approach every customer. My goal is to make sure they are all contacted and to inform them of any specials we may have going on. After I have engaged all customers, I scan my area to make sure everything is presentable and neat. I must have a clean work area to function."
good,"I enjoyed working at the store and getting the benefits and discounts. But the management staff was awful. They wasn't there to help the company grow, because some of them was just there to do good at the store so they can move to a bigger store to manage."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The employees in my area were very good people. The work environment and their ideal work sheet idea's were terrible, and actually lessened sales."
good,Best Buy is ideal for those still in school and for those who don;t have a family and would potential want to become a manager. I personally had issues with the pay and the difficult nature of promotions.
good,Specializing in the selling of cellular phone services and accessories for all the major carriers. Interacted with customers and lead my area in sales and conversions.
good,"It's a Great Company to work for if you have good Managers.  Worked there for many years and had many Managers, when they were good, it was great to work there.  When Managers or times were bad, it was a nightmare.  But I suppose that's like any other job."
good,"Best Buy is a very fun and exciting place to work, however, the leadership does not always follow the company values, making the job feel far more tedious than it really is."
good,I rang up customers at the cash registers and sold reward zone memberships and extended warranties. The hours were great during thanksgiving-christmas. I was given very few hours during the week after that and was forced to work almost every weekend. Some managers were great and others were hard to deal with. I left for college and they said they would welcome me back. I returned for the summer and the manager wouldn't even talk to me and avoided my phone calls.
good,"Good place to work while in high school or while in college.  Not good for long-term careers, as it's very hard to get promotions within the company"
good,"Typical day starts at 8am and goes until all deliveries are made, and sometimes they add additional ones on to you. I've learned that you have to just go in, do what needs to be done and leave, Do not make plans on days you work as they will find a way to have you working longer than you expected. Management only cares about numbers. They don't care about your personal life outside of work. In store associates seem to not be held accountable while delivery drivers must correct any problems created in store for delivery. Co-workers are great. Hardest part of job is dealing with screw-ups from in store associates. Most enjoyable is... the discount for working"
good,Management and co-workers made the job enjoyable. I would work the front cash registers or the customer service desk and balance my drawer before leaving for the day. I enjoy working with people.
good,Best Buy was a great place to work but the job security has quickly declined and makes for a tough environment to work in with an already demanding schedule and no work life balance.
good,"awful politics, unrealistic expectations considering they expect their regular associates to perform at corporate wireless standards but only pay them minimum or near minimum wage."
good,"Part time hours at the discretion of a leadership team generally in their 20's with maybe a bachelor degree or maybe going to school - for the most part, the leaders in the store I worked for had been with the company since high school. My immediate superiors were 19, 20, and 26 when I was hired for a seasonal position. "
good,"I truly enjoy working at Best Buy. The store has a fun atmosphere that makes working there easy. Offering services on computers can be tough. Computers are extremely personal items, and when they break down it can be very stressful. Clients often come in and are frustrated or confused. I take pride in helping these clients, in making them feel like they are being taken care of. This would be the hardest part of my job, but knowing that they are relieved is the best part"
good,"Not much to say here. OK part-time income, good people, some days are fun with customers. Get to work with technology and sometimes advancement in the company can be obtained."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy typically revolved around aiding customers in their essential consumer needs, stocking items, receiving and placing orders, placing and receiving phone calls, managing customer accounts, general cashier responsibilities, merchandising, and cleaning. "
good,"As a Geek Squad senior, My job was to manage the department while the DCI was on the floor pushing PC sales. Management at this location played favorites when it came to raises and promotions. Many positions that were supposed to be open to other employees (JOS) within the company often were given to people within the store. The values that were taught were often not followed in this location. This is due to pressure to push service plans and unnecessary attachments to keep your job. Low numbers = no job. This is understandable in any company to continue growth. However in a company like Best Buy, at least in this store, the customers interest is not in mind. That is based on my observations as a supervisor and should be taken as such. I left on my own accord."
good,best buy store 150 seems to be just like high school. Where everybody talks behind your back and the managers are afraid to treat you like a normal human being because they may end up understanding you. Iv'e seen positions promised to employees with no resault. Full of politics.  I really enjoyed learning about different products and assisting customers with my knowledge. 
good,"A typical day at work was to stock inventory use an RF scanner and read a blueprint on where I had to stock items.  Spoke with customers and opened new mobile contract to multiple mobile providers (Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-mobile, and etc.)  Changed rate data plans and helped customers with mobile malfunctions.  I learned that working at a 3rd party for mobile devices is easier to create customers satisfaction if our work was correct.  Management was alright, they did scheduling depending on our schedules we had issued during orientation.  Co-workers were astounding very fun to work with.  Hardest part of the job would have to be unsatisfied customers; dealing with customers that are furious made it hard to accomplish our mission.  The most enjoyable part would be the workers very enthusiastic about electronics and welcoming. "
good,"My favorite part of the job was meeting lots of interesting people and getting to know them during each sale."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I learned about the business aspect of sales. I enjoy working with technology and in sales. I am looking for a company where I am able to develop and grow. 
good,"Nice employee discount, management was ok, and opportunity to transfer to different department. "
good,I think this place its fun because you can learn so much about technology. The only bad experience was that they don't care about for career advancement and they don't care if you take breaks or not. 
good,"They're pretty flexible with your schedule, and they rarely ever just lay people off, which are both great things. There's also plenty of information available via digital tools that are relativley easy to access (like job postings, training, scheduling, ec.) But management treats some employees better than others, and it really shows. The numbers are more important than the employees. The best part is the Discount."
good,"Impossible to move up in the company, management sees their employees as disposable, favoritism is a huge problem."
good,"Typical retail experience...low pay, no advancement, and terrible schedule for seeing family. As the economy crashed in 2008, the company cut manager, sup, and lead spots and put more responsibility on hourly employees. Managers hire and promote unqualified friends. Sales is high pressure eve though no commission. It paid for my college but I wish I would have done internships instead and learned more."
good,"i did enjoy this job, however, there was no commission involved in my pay, and i felt like i was working harder than the rest of my teammates, but not seeing any extra benefit. co workers are great people, i just can see myself doing something better for myself than this, i feel i am a hard worker and deserve a lot more."
good,"-picking online orders, cleaning restrooms and parking lot and also loadind and unloading freight and custmers."
good,"Regular retail work. Full time is considered a promotion at Best Buy that puts a employee into 32 hour work week, yes I states that correctly 32 hours not 40. A employee can make $10.50 to $11.50 to start out even with a sales background. Some can land $12 plus but it is rare. No commission is paid here only a bonus system that I live of off to make ends meet and pay for school other wise I would go hungry."
good,"It's a fun place to work for a retail environment. Everyone is a big family, but there are a few bad eggs. Management is terrible with everything coming down the chain from 4 different managers daily. The pay is desirable once you reach the level where they are comfortable with your skills."
good,"Busy work environment, had to stay on your toes. the experience was great."
good,"Best Buy is an enjoyable company to work for when you first get hired, after being there for a few months you will learn that the values and culture of the company are always changing. Depending on which department you are hired for the compensation can be either very well or very low, when I was first hired I received base pay, six months I switched my position but was basically still doing the same thing and my compensation almost doubled. I must admit this is a great job while you are still in school, but I would not look into the company as a career path/."
good,"Best Buy joins many other corporations which are highly proficient at ensuring high part time and temporary worker turnover. They only a handful of full time associate-level employees to stay cheap. Supervisors and Managers both recieve very poor training, and lead by driving and spitting sales quips, leaving the part time employees to carry the store. They shotgun their employees further by taking the ""lowest 3 performers"" into what is for all intents and purposes a disciplinary hearing at the end of every week. If you consistently end up in these hearings you will be fired or get written up. You are to sell services, even if that means misleading your customers. You are encouraged to be dishonest about credit applications for in-house lines of credit, to get as many people to apply as possible even when you know about half the people that apply will be denied. You do not move upwards in the chain of management unless you are willing to violate ethics and at the same time demand them. The entire department I worked in was denied breaks of any kind, and anyone who took breaks was thought poorly of. You will be expected to do work and tasks beyond your job description and will recieve arbitrary deadlines to complete work which you are not supposed to do. The way the policies are written, anyone who is not full time will probably be terminated, or be forced to quit. There are always perfect little performers, but the majority of people are only expected to last a year at the most. This ensures a long line of potential employees and a short budget for benefits and pay. The most"
good,• Assist with advanced/complex installation of home theater/satellite/multi-room audio products and provide technical advice and assistance
good,"It was an interesting experience but it honestly wasn't worth the stress, the management is horrendous, but the pay and benefits made it tolerable."
good,"We unloaded trucks, stock shelves, balanced funds,interviewed, trained, store motivationing meeting. Co-workers were very diverse, as management our job could be very stressful, but at the end of the day we as a whole made it through the good and bad of the day."
good,● Your typical day at work includes actively sales leading for 7 of 10 hours. This makes it difficult to complete people/performance management tasks without extending your work week.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I spent the past seven years learning all there is to know about retail,merchandising,shipping/receiving, and customer service."
good,"Working here was indeed fun and I learned a lot from working here but here was a major lack of communication throughout the store. This caused many problems among different departments, customers, and even employees. I received no formal training which then was brought up negatively in my review and there were a few times I was sent home early and then called back asking why I left. Other than that it was a fun job ad I learned a lot about new technology."
good,I chose to work at Best Buy because I was attending college at the time and wanted some sales experience.
good,Good place to start not a career for most. Some days are really enjoyable but most days the pressure to sell is so high that it feels like a commission shop when most employees make under $9/hour.
good,recommend for those who are in school or have multiple jobs. pay on the low end depending on your work schedule.
good,a typical day at work in a retail store helping customers. I learned how to multitask better. My co-workers were fun to work with but some of the hire ups take their job too seriously. the hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer.
good,"Basically its an on your feet, dealing with customers job with the realization that not many people are what they seem. Not many employees care and, drama is always floating around."
good,A typical day at work consists of working with customers in finding the products they need. I have learned that I am a great salesman. My management is ill qualified since our GM quit to go to Apple Co. The hardest part of the job is putting 110% into my work when I am not compensated according to my sales ability. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with the general public and giving them advice on their purchases.
good,• Staffed cashier and customer service positions.
good,On a typical day I would work multiple departments doing various assignments. I learned alot about about what consumers needs and wants in this position. The hardest part of my job is sometimes having to work multiple departments at one time and the most enjoyable part of my job is having excellent co workers to work with that dont mind helping each other in a time of need.
good,BestBuy is one of the best company I worked for. They have the newest and best technology available. Everyone is nice and for someone who enjoys sale its the perfect Part Time job. Management however is not so good. Managers are way too young and do not have much experience. Some have attitudes and some are very nice. The General Manager however is in control of everything.
good,Can be a fun enjoyable work place with the right management. Needs to work on getting employee wages up to attract the top level workers needed for a company to boom.
good,"no room for advancement, to much favortism and broad range of opinions and values there."
good,Working here was a place for me to go that i knew was stable and not going out of business. I worked all over he state for them and was the first certified installer for best buy in the state but as the department grew the took away all the privilages that they had originally offered me and completely changed structure of how business was being conducted.
good,"Best Buy was overall a good experience and I left the company in very good terms. The co-workers are great to work with and it's almost a family like atmosphere. Managers were very supportive as far as your progress goes, making sure every step of the way you were learning as much as possible. A typical day would include making sales, down stocking computers for the next day, cleaning up the department, and making sure everything looked perfect. However, the amount of pay a Computer Sales Associate made was very low, no commission, therefore no drive or true motivation was given for sales. When I tried to transfer to a new department I did my interview and was told it went well, then a month passed and still no word from my Managers about a new position. Afterwords, I took it upon myself to ask the product manager if any decision had been made and asked why it had taken so long when others got their decision immediately and he said that ""the department you want to go to had a miscount and there were too many people in that department already."" So I can say there was a lack of professionalism and communication there. Also my yearly review was never done and when I asked about it they said that my supervisor, who had been terminated, sent out the papers already for the review without conducting one. So on that end I think Best Buy needs to treat their employees with more respect and regard. I appreciate the experience there and learn a lot about how to communicate with people very well."
good,"Best Buy can be a cool fun place to work where compensation is more than fair!!! The culture is dependent on the leader in charge and the execution of living company values is inconsistent from store to store. Best Buy recently has made a lot of changes to stay ahead of the curve, but continues to fall just short of expected execution. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work with the latest and greatest in technology and having the responsibility of teaching all of our customers about the innovations! We worked closely with coworkers with in the store and vendor partners to ensure we had the ability to deliver the best consumer electronic experience we could. Every day we worked on our ability to interact with our customers and be able to educate them. We practiced ways of speaking, body language, the art of the the demo and a wide range of speaking to product abilities."
good,had a wonderful discount but the company doesnt offer much personal time
good,Upper management is entrenched with in the system at bestbuy they often shuffle poor preforming managers to well preforming stores in an effort to keep them in the system. Favoritism runs wild with in each store as supervisor positions are often filled by those who have a history with the current manager and often not by the best person for the job . This has lead the decreased moral in alot of stores which has lead to poor sales performance . Also company restructure which forced out many of the best and most knowledgeable sales employees by taking away of titles and slashing pay . These employees then where replaced by less knowledgeable often high school aged kids who have little motivation to stay with the company.
good,The company is owned by Best Buy. It gives a large variety of electronic experience for all levels of gadgets. You will learn a large variety skills from various Windows and Mac based OS. You will also learn to troubleshoot a very large amount of various computer issues including networking.
good,"Clean and make pizza, I learned you must work for what you earn. Management was not great, nor co-workers. Hardest being cleaning the fryers, and most enjoyable was making the pizza."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working here has been a fun and interesting experience for the most part although, it requires a certain personality type to truly excel."
good,"Helping customers find their technological needs. Able to move from dept.to dept, every day is different."
good,work/life balance was definitely not there and schedule was different everyweek
good,a great place to work for an undergraduate student: a good combo for work and school life. The management was there to help if you needed assistance.
good,"On a typical day I work, I start out the morning by switching out the new price changes for different products as Best Buy is always updating their prices to be able to compete with the competition. After price changes I start the shipment of DEVO, which is returned items or non-working items that are sent to a different warehouse. By 10:30 or 11:00, we get a shipment of product from UPS. I then receive the product and immediately place it on the floor once it is in our inventory system. While I am receiving product, we sometimes get what is called ""dot.coms"". A dot.com is when a customer see's a product they like on our website and chooses for us to find the product for them so that they can go straight to customer service to pick up their newly bought item. It makes it easier for customers so they don't have to walk around the store aimlessly and avoid the trouble of having to look for the item. I also do ""carryouts"" and carryouts are when customers buy large or heavier items that they will need help with getting into their cars. This is a typical day but a truck night is a whole other type of routine. On a truck night we typically get 2,000 - 3,500 pieces of product. Our job is to unload the truck of all its contents and then take those products and place them in their designated areas. It's a long process but with the right amount of employees it can be done in a fair amount of time."
good,This is a great store for someone who is in college or possibly to have on the side. I wouldn't recommend it if you're attempting to live off this salary.
good,"Really introduces you to working and working retail, will leave you with some excellent people and sales skills. Leaves almost no time to have a life of your own, outside work. Compensation, ""its retail""."
good,I learned that working in retail can be a bit trying but working for Best Buy taught me a few things. I only worked there for 3 months before taking my talents to the Vanguard Group.
good,"Working with the general public often tests my patience however this job really helps with the ability to solve issues as well as helps really shape who you are. The hardest part of my job would be having to deal with all types of situations. One minute you'll be getting praised by a customer and the next you'll be getting screamed at by a customer. So it is very 50/50. But through out my years working here it really helped me become the person I am today. I'm quick thinking, patient, and I am able to look at both sides to a situation."
good,Great place to learn basic skills to take to other careers. Great for fresh college students looking to make some change. Can become very repetitive.
good,"When I first got the job, the Management team was great. The store morale could not be beat. I was happy to be going to work. Working at Best Buy was a very enjoyable experience. Even the morning and night meetings were cool. Wearing a pair of shoes that had lots of colors was a good thing because it added to your personality at work. Everyone was nice to each other and the store was doing well."
good,they offer you a part time position schedule you for 7 hours a week then they just keep hiring more people instead of giving you more hours
good,"Great part time job, very limited opportunity to move up in company."
good,learned a lot about cell phones
good,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind dealing with corporate retail sales. Wish there were more benefits for employees. My co-workers were great and I miss them. Management for the most part was awesome. Didn't like to feel like the annoying guy shoving product down everyone's throat. Could tell that customers don't like to be contacted in the same department more than once.
good,Gained extensive product and customer service knowledge about electronic products.
good,Best Buy/Geek Squad has been a great company to work for. They are more like a family then a workplace. They downside is retail hours when you have children is hard to work late nights and weekends.
good,"It is stressful sometimes if your not use to working in that kind of work environment. It feels like you work on commission, but your not paid for it. Its not very professional the workers kind of act like they are still in High School ."
good,"I've worked here 3 years and the only positive is the field I work in. I happen to enjoy it. They have poor management skills, poor business models and plans, and do not follow up properly on issues like pay and benefits. Promotions not based on performance, but the ability to suck up to bosses."
good,Best Buy was a good source for new information on technology and getting deals. Always had hands-on experience with new items and showed how it applied to customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked at the head office in Burnaby.  Over the years, I had been shifted into several different departments: marketing, learning and development etc. I was let go one Monday morning as soon as I arrived for work  there was no reason aside from me assuming they were downsizing"
good,Muy buena empresa pero se batalla mucho para pedir un puesto mejor no toman en cuenta a los empleados que quieren subir de puesto y prefieren contratar a otras personas que subir a los empleados que ya tienen ahí  los sueldos un poco bajos prestaciones regulares.
good,"if your new to the work force then best buy is a great place to start. i dint see it as a very serious  career, however some of the management roles do provide great expirience."
good,"There's little to no room for advancement but pay is decent for what is done, you need the energy to be non stop for the duration of the shift and keep up your pace"
good,"Working at Best Buy was an overall good experience, I enjoyed learning about new products and being able to sell them. Very comparative environment but all in good fun"
good,Come into work and clock in and just start helping customers. work place is not bad the co workers are all cool and friendly. you just do your job and no one will care.
good,I enjoyed working for Best Buy while I was working there. The scheduling was a little off as far as hours wish they had given more hours.Overall it was an okay experience
good,Definitely not the best place to work. If you work hard it's only a 50% chance you actually move up in the company. Easy job depending on where you land and what ypur knowledge of your areas are  Its a plus to know many things
good,"Everyday is different working customer service and there is always a lot to learn, no matter how long you've been there. I have learned how to handle different types of customers. My only complaint is the managers and the fact that they only really care to make a profit and nothing else."
good,"management needs work, and hard work isn`t noticed. sometimes you get good hours other times it is hit or miss, overall easy to work there if you need a first time job"
good,"It was cool, just a place you could get stuck at honestly. I hated how they weren’t willing to work with me far as holidays. I was a grad student who didn’t have family here so I asked can I go home for the holiday and they basically told me no but they only schedule me to work 3 days a week!"
good,"Long term employees haven't been disciplined in so long it's very difficult to do so as a new Manager. Upper Management and HR will not support you when trying to change a toxic culture, yet they expect change without their support."
good,"You experience will heavily vary based on your direct sup, and GM. They will over work you if you allow it, and have very poor flexibility for a second job, or a family life."
good,"Good job for anyone who wants to get involved in sales. Unfortunately you don't make commission and the bonus system does not fairly distribute money, starting hourly wage is good though."
good,"management is usually nice and understanding of school schedule and priority, best and only perk : huge discount on bestbuy brands like insignia and rocketfish and decent discount on logitech other discounts are not worth."
good,"Excellent place to work, everyone is nice. I had fun learning about technology and services, plus getting to know everyone at work and outside of work, was just amazing."
good,"Thought I was doing a good job but was released same day (Finished shift, though) suddenly.  Worked for a contracting firm and neither Best Buy or them would give me a reason for relief.  If I did something to deserve it, I am man enough to take ownership.  Had a good relationship with my superiors, I thought, and fellow co-workers.  Loved the facility!!"
good,I've enjoyed my time with the company and the people that I have interacted with at the store level. But company decisions (mainly corporate) have been extremely flawed and performance goals as to bonusing are skewed to not work in the employees favor no matter their actual performance.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Treated like I was stealing, I was patted down by a guy that worked there accusing me of stealing. Never stolen anything in my life. Some management there was easy to work with."
good,"Good company to work for. Typical retail business with room for growth. A lot of opportunity to work in the field you want. The culture is great but the work like balance for my management role is terrible and underpaid. "
good,My time at Best Buy has allowed me to meet people from all walks of life. It has taught me how to work as a team and how to speak to various types of people.
good,"It was okay, I don’t really enjoy getting into detail about it. Didn’t really pay my bills, did not help me advance in my career field. College felt like a joke to them."
good,"Working here wasn't too bad. It's easy as long as you know/learned the material and can help customer find what they need and sell them what Best Buy thinks they need."
good,"Overall Best Buy was a decent place to work for. I developed my leadership and management skills there and definitely use them at my new job. The benefits they offer and employee discounts were great so I can't complain about that. The culture was okay but there was SO MANY business model changes. I do believe change is a key to success but too much change can damage a company. Management was okay for the most part but I will warn you, there is HUGE difference between a LEADER and a MANAGER. Just to throw this out there, the company needs to find more LEADERS and stop trying to get managers. Favoritism was an issue and will be for a lot of businesses so it shouldn't be a surprise there. Expect to work work every weekend and holiday unless you request it off. BTW good luck getting a holiday off."
good,I worked as an advanced repair agent for the geek squad. My duties often span to covering other duties that were not my own due to management shortcomings and management-employee relations.
good,"Everyone thinks they know what their doing. If they don't know they pretend they know so you won't really get an answer. Instead you gotta find the answer yourself. Supervisors don't communicate with each other, so if your supervisor is off that day, good luck!"
good,"A typical day of work for sales associates entails memorizing sales, keeping in contact with customers, pushing sales and building baskets while pushing for Best Buy premium services and the Best Buy card. The hardest part of the job is keeping a good morale on days where you miss quotas for sales and management is on your back. The best moments are when customer truly enjoy the experience and help they received, and their purchase. Like any other retail environment the store morale/success is heavily management influenced."
good,"If you play your cards right and kiss up you can move up fast. Make friends with the managers even if you hate them. I constantly called out managers for being hypocritical and making bad buisness moves which lead to me being their most valuable CSA but their least liked among managers. Which caused them to not want to promote me and promote their friends, best buy is all about making friends. Managers often partied with other associates which caused alot of favoritism. Also managers half the time breath down your neck about sales and services but wont actually help with the issues, at 0126 they make exceptions way out of return policy and then wonder why we dont sell more gsp."
good,"I worked for best buy for almost a year as a cashier/customer service specialist. It was part-time and I was 17 years old. I believe it is a good part-time job, you will be up on your feet all day. I would greet customers, take payments, stock products did returns/exchanges, dealt with complaints. It is the most stressful during the holidays but besides the hectic traffic during the holidays it was a good job to have whilst still in school. "
good,Worked for Best Buy for a little over three years. Went from part time Inventory to full time Project Team. Project Team are the people that tear down and reinstall new/old fixtures for the store during graveyard shift. Actually had a lot of fun working with my team. Unfortunately the Manager above my Supervisor decided to fire me for calling in when my father was in the hospital.  fact he
good,It was a fun place to work alongside amazing people but it is not very practical and would have to work multiple jobs to make it anywhere. There was not much room for advancement and would make for an awesome first job or filler.
good,It was a very fast paced environment. Very customer service oriented no matter what department you work in. I enjoyed the team that i had the privilege of working with.
good,"It really depends on the store, but working at Best Buy can be really fun with a little effort and some luck."
good,"You find yourself forced to up-sell customers on unnecessary products, day-in and day-out. Sales requirements aren't directly stated, but are ""implied""; although my metrics were never made known to me."
good,"good place to learn and grow. the store will be your life at full time. As for greater advancement, prepare to be their pack mule for a year at least. "
good,"It was my first real job so i didnt expect much but they really do try and make it seem like best buy is the best company in the world, and to be fair they have great products and reliable service but the culture was too robotic for me to pursue a future with them. it seemed like we were all slaves there just waiting to be put into the department we wanted to be in the first place."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you're in school but I do not recommend this as a life-long career. This company makes a lot of changes without thinking about impacts to individual employees. I've seen coworkers lose their jobs just because the company changed how the stores were structured. I feel this company needs to learn a lot about how to treat their employees. Please keep this in mind if you are considering working here.
good,You will get good experience at an entry level workplace to help further your resume. If looking to move up the corporate ladder you need to go all in and you will need to look after yourself and possibly step on some peoples toes on the way there. This company pushes sales  VERY hard and the compensation you get in return isn’t always the greatest. They are not afraid to move positions around so don’t get too comfortable.
good,Good opportunities to advance. Bad management though. The culture in this store isint good. Good discount. I dont know what else to say about working here
good,We were asked for a lot but not paid equally for our work. The pay is very low. The discount is good but not worth the amount of money you're receiving every two weeks.
good,"It is not a super competitive place to work at. If you are looking to move up in this company, it is really easy, but it is imperative to become friends with the management staff. You have to be ready to devote much of your time to working a very flexible personal schedule and rubbing elbows with the aforementioned management personnel. "
good,"The job was very fast-paced for the most part, but some days were very slow. I spent most of my day answering phone calls and fixing problems with customer orders. The management when I started was good, but the last GM before I quit was horrible and is the reason I left."
good,I worked here as a seasonal customer service specialist. For one they told me I was part time and not seasonal and I asked many time to make sure so I didn’t have to find a new job. When the season was up they stopped scheduling me and said I was seasonal even though I asked multiple times if I wasn’t. Also a lot of people at this job are very stuck up and lots of gossip goes on. If they don’t like you then no one likes you. Also they do not train you well. I was very uncomfortable working alone at the desk because I still did not know a lot of stuff
good,"The coworkers were the bright side of coming to work. Management didn't care about you. Always one-sided within their favor when coming to situations. It was more of an employee vs. the company in terms of trying to stay long. The responsibilities are easy, but the atmosphere and culture is nothing to what they seem to display to the public. I learned how to sell, communication, and behavior awareness (THE MOST). Ok job to start but not worth the pay for a salesperson position when the company doesn't offer commission. The benefits are WORTH IT though."
good,Made out to be more stressful then it should be. Managers down your throat to do more and they don’t care about customers. Pay isn’t good and only raises are annual but are a joke and almost insulting.
good,"The environment is amazing, just don't mess up. IF you hit the wrong button in the register or fail to be trained on an aspect of your current position. Odds are, it will ""Go to HR"" and that means you will be ""Promoted to customer"""
good,"bad management, rude customers, petty workplace, best part was clocking out, worse part is working customer service wiith childish employees. hopefully its improved this was my experience in 2015"
good,"I worked Best Buy as a entry level salesman and worked part time. Problem being is at hire, I was told there were performance incentives and bonuses based on signing people up on contracts and selling X amount of products per shift. Here's the problems, after about 5 months I discovered the incentives was not getting your hours cut, and the bonuses were only available to full time employees which is unfortunate when you work at a small mobile store and don't get the opportunity to work full time and are constantly having hours cut because of ""performance"" problems. Best Buy doesn't explain this, or mine sure didn't."
good,It was a fun workplace. You will get to work with great people. They picked their favorite and if you were not one of them no one cared about you. Loved the discount on items.
good,It was a really fun place to work you meet alot of people. Management during my time there was shady and not the best but look at it as a place to learn how to deal with all types of different people and trouble shooting!
good,Everything there depends on your manager. If you want to move up. Get in good with them. Otherwise you will never move up. Its unfortunate but it happens.
good,"Management is constantly on you for everything, they hold you late at night until every little micro crumb is picked up. They wont work with you when you need to take off unless you're a college or high school student. General manager picks favorites and makes it difficult to advance while there."
good,"its was interesting  to be able to get familiar with a wide rage of products "
good,For GeekSquad. At-home work that paid very little and very time consuming. Worked as a contractor and was released from the contract nationally with no forewarning.
good,Would  be  a  great  part  time  job  or  a  stepping  stone  to  get  where  you  would  really  like  to  go  as  far  as  a  career  is  concerned.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Not the best, and not the worst, A lot of in store drama between employees. Some will go out of their way to make drama via false rumors or spreading of private information. Management doesn't seem to care. Benefits are above average."
good,The management was in some ways juvenile and sometimes even aggressive. Their goals are straight and fair however how they treat each worker depends on your productivity.
good,"I was an excellent employee, started out as a seasonal cashier, then got hired for a permanent cashier, was quickly promoted to Home Theater Sales Consultant, and then after that was chosen to be the Sony Brand rep for home theater. All this time I was exceeding hourly sales goals, selling protection plans, and getting credit card applications daily. I got paid $10/hr with 0% commission for this."
good,"Company is retail, so as a beginning job its fine. As for advancement seek a career job or specialized job. Overall, the company is okay but because it is retail, they press too hard for sales instead of actually meeting the needs of the customers."
good,It's  a decent place to work. Lots of skills to learn about all products. But at some point you can out on pay. And when you need a raise to make better ends meet they cant. And also for a while they will train you with the information and help you learn. But after a while you have to take everything into you own hands then you are are your own and all the time you put into that you are not paid well enough for the time. Mgmt could be  better. Better pay for more responsibilities. Decent but could be way better.
good,"Would start job at 9am. Designated jobs would already be scheduled for the entire day. Would pick up company vehicle and may or may not work with partner to complete jobs including television mountings, security system installs, full audio system conceals and tv calibrations. Employees in my department were all hard working and dedicated to cooperate to overcome any and all obstacles to ensure full client satisfaction. Hardest part of the job was the driving in winter months to northern towns during snow storms. Easiest part of the job was putting smiles on client faces."
good,"At Best Buy you would always hear people talk about how great things ""used to be."" and that's pretty much the cycle the company moves in. During my time there, my position was eliminated and my pay was drastically cut, and unless things have changed since then it seemed like middle management was always on the chopping block. The discount was great, but you generally don't make enough money to enjoy it. Overall, it's retail, the customers can be a pain, and the hours suck. With that said, it's still probably one of the better retail establishments to work for."
good,Management can often be pushy or unhelpful. Very little patients. Coworkers make or break the job as you will spend 8 hrs a day with them 5 days in a row.
good,"Provided a daily budget to hit, provide great customer service in-store and over the phone customer interactions, make sure all displayed products were functional and maintained the departments cleanliness."
good,"Everyone that works there knows Best Buy doesn't pay enough. The place is somewhat layed back. Managers are normally understranding, but if you ask off even one day your going to get punished for it even if you don't ask off very often like maybe a 1-3 times a year. There's better places to work at. But its not the worse."
good,it is a fun job while in college but management is poor. Best part is all of the discounts you get from the products sold at best buy. the pay is also bad
good,It was a nice work environment.the managers worked okay with their employees. At times they work around your schedule. You get out of work late that probably it.
good,"Store culture is great, and coworkers want to be able to help each other. Members of management have a strong tendency to show heavy favoritism, by way of looking the other way for mistakes a preferred employee makes while punishing those less preferred for the same actions."
good,Bestbuy is a fun job with a awesome coworkers. The main downfall is that management will say whatever they need to keep staff from leaving but rarely keep their word. Promotions are often planned out months in advance so applying to a new position is almost always a fruitless endeavor.
good,"Try not to be here for long, as you won't advance easily. Pay raises are minimal and you will get a pat on the back for working hard, but no more. Management cannot seem to keep hard working employees, I hire turnover is the result."
good,I was a car audio manager and enjoyed helping clients find and design their new car audio system that was tailored to them. We also had weekly offsite department meetings to maintain open communication.
good,"The job is ok, the people suck. Lots of favoritism. There is no real organization unless the district manager is coming for a visit all in all I like the job, I just dislike management"
good,"The workplace culture her is not good. The work is not hard itself, it's actually a good job. The management is what makes it a bad place to work. I love the idea of working with different people and the fact that the job is challenging and fast paced. The hours are long, sometimes 14-16 hour days, and they are not willing to work with you when you need to leave early, even after you've been there for more than 12 hours."
good,"Good as a job for young people, but full of usual retail related caveats that would prevent it from being a great life-long career. The GM at this location was great, but the manager of Geek Squad was highly problematic."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working for the ECC office is a gamble. Either you'll get a great manager and good hours or you'll get a nightmare of both. The benefits are outstanding, but the pay does not scale well, making this a great job to keep for a year or two to get on your feet before you move on to a company that appreciates your talents."
good,Management shows favoritism to certain employees and these employees get preferential treatment. Need clear directions on tasks. Pay is competitive and hours can be long
good,"For someone in warehouse, your hours usually aren't great unless it's holiday season or unless you're full time (which is difficult to get). Also in the warehouse do you encounter a lot of micro-management. The actual management is alright but there are definitely politics. Most attention goes to the sales floor and there are not usually any sort of rewards for employees in operations. The hardest part of the job is probably holiday hours, but on the contrary it's very difficult financially when you only get 22 hours a week for most of the year, even when you are a knowledgeable and reliable employee. Pay is not as competitive as they brag about and the benefits are almost nonexistent unless you have made it to full time... and not all of us have even after several years of employment. The best thing about the job is *most* of your coworkers..."
good,Employees feel extremely undervalued and under payed. turn over rate is huge. New employees start at more than old employees on a consistent basis. Only incentive is a pay raise once per year at 63 cents maximum
good,"Entry level jobs in best buy can be fun, but dealing with metrics and sales quotas without any sort of incentive pay is only good for getting experience, not affording to live."
good,Employees are fun to work with which makes the time go by faster. Great with work flexibility and awesome first job for anyone to start. Management does a good enough job.
good,"Every job has its ups and downs. I think it was just rough here because they expect so much of you and numbers, numbers, numbers. That's all it's ever about."
good,Worked part-time while I was looking for a full-time job. Employees were nice but a very stressful place to work. Not very good salary for your usual employee but they catered for the much younger employee who didn't mind working for minimum wage.
good,"In a typical day, you walk in and get prepared on your own to consult the customer. There are certain goals that the sales manager will call out over the walkie talkie if are lucky to start the opening shift. The more experience and I am speaking of literally days after you start working your total sales target will increase. That is the easy part until they hit you with the total about of credit card applications and Geek Squad Protection plans you will have to sell along with your total sells."
good,"BBY is fairly standard retail environment in it's present day condition. Prior to the advent of Amazon, the company was more focused on the employee and providing quality experiences and training which translated to quality experiences for the customer. In order to compete with Amazon, the labor budgets were cut. This forced management to staff less customer facing and non customer facing employees on a daily basis and require more work and sales expectations from the existing staff. This translated to less customer focused sales interactions and more typical sell quantity of units per hour in a standard retail environment. Sales goals and expectations were set higher for management, which rendered goal and bonus achievement unrealistic.  This caused management to be more cut throat when district and territory staff came to call for answers as financial outcomes weren't where they were being budgeted for."
good,Not a great company if you are looking to make good money. Management will definitely play favorites. It takes a very long time just to go from part time to full time.
good,I got hired in September and in late December I was offered no hours at all. I was informed it was because they didn't actually want another agent. However Corporate was forcing the Geek Squad Manager to hire another Agent.
good,"work there for many years . no way to move up in company . pay and benefits are good . work place culture could be better ,lots of gossip and rumors , gm can be overbearing at times."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to start out but in the end, it may not work for you as a career. In my experience, there was a lack of focused development for the individual and it was frustratingly short sighted. "
good,"fun, easy work place. I wasn't too fond of some managers but the ones who knew what they were doing made up for the ones who weren't good at their jobs. The discounts are a plus. The pay isn't enough considering they expect you to go above and beyond."
good,"Best Buy is a nice place to work, temporarily. It's a great place to gain experience in sales and customer service; a great stepping stone into future endeavours."
good,The communication between the store upper store management and the lower level employees is highly lacking. Very little communication if any at all with the lowest level employees.
good,Good work environment but typically had trouble working with my school schedule and cut my hours more and more each time i would work and not meet expectations. The issue was they were expecting me to meet the same goals as people who were working Full shifts. I was getting scheduled for 4 hours a week at one point and they were still expecting me to produce the same numbers as the people working 20 hours each week
good,"The assistant manager needs to be changed. She causes the high job turnover rate by the way she treats people, very disrespectful. The fact nothing has been done to remove her from her position or from the store also causes the turnover rate."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The days start to get a bit repetitive but still manages to be fun. My coworkers were fun to be around for the most part. management was actually excellent until they left and was replaced by other store managers.
good,you go in and you're supposed to have a daily briefing and when it's not done because the manager is nowhere to be found it's 'your fault'.  The 'goals' that they set are unrealistic and not evenly distributed.
good,"Leadership encourages capitulation rather than active dialogue. Group's work hour policy claims 'flexible hours' but in reality, leadership expects butts in seats."
good,A typical work day stress starts before walking in the building. If you was a minute late it was grounds for determination. You can call out sick and still have a job.
good,"I would come in the morning, place new prices, then serve customers for 8 hours, have a 30 minutes break not paid, and then finish my shift, fortunately I didn't have to close the store, if I had to i would clean my department ( I had 3 department to manages at once ), then bring all the boxes forward and wait until a manager decides its clean enough before opening the doors to let me leave. The most enjoyable part was knowing that there was talking to customers and making conversation, the hardest part of the job was to sell warranties without commission and being forced to sell or else they would look at our sales and talk to me about how much little effort I am putting, when clearly I have no gain with working 8 hours a day and getting yelled at by customers and being paid minimum with no gain of salary."
good,"Having room to grow inside became increasingly difficult with most stores bargaining and trading employees and management around. The pay was based very loosely on performance was given out for seniority more. Job security varied position to position, but, consistently it wasn't great."
good,"I enjoyed my last 2 1/2 years working with the company. But having room to grow inside became increasingly difficult with most stores bargaining and trading employees and management around. The pay was based very loosely on performance was given out for seniority more. Job security varied position to position, but, consistently it wasn't great. The tech culture and environment of curious and intrigued minds was very stimulating and a joy to be a part of. But i need a career that's not just going to fulfill my needs culturally (Having a fun, safe, hazard free and hostile free environment), but financially, mentally, and professionally."
good,Great company that drives for you to succeed. Training is incredible and you will learn a lot within the sales and customer service aspects during your time there.
good,"hard physical labor, very fast paced, rate per piece count, management is lacking and very judgmental.  Bottom line its about making the sale which is expected for retail.  Never knew your end time-some days would be a 6 hr day and others over 8, peak hours you never see daylight and most departments work six days a week."
good,a good learning job lead role experience easy work annually raise with benefits. Good people to work with. good pay. exp with office related products.
good,"It's a job. Favoritism is a thing, will always be a thing. It's cut throat but sugarcoated with flowers and candies, you know? The pay is good, but it's not good enough for a primary source of income even if you have roommates. "
good,Management was never on the same page as one another . It was either their way or no way . No comprising when it came to anything . Became stressful from all the gossip. Nothing was confidential.
good,High paced environment with high energy.  Stress full in pushing for extended warranties and in how to train employees on successfully getting the customer to purchase.
good,Some weeks you would get 40 hours others would be closer to 25 or so. Not knowing how many hours or what work you were going to have made the job very inconsistent.
good,Dusting and stocking shelves. Pricing new items. Following the planogram for new items and layouts. The hardest part of the job is explaining how this new technology will improve the customers life. Cheap is not always the best way to go.
good,"Unstable hours, but at the least 40 per week. Management getting better. Day shift versus night shift not a real team environment. Not much micromanaging."
good,"Not a bad place to work for a little extra money for the holiday season but management at the henderson location could use revamping, not much else to say"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Its typical retail work. They promote usually within and sometimes managers/coworkers who should not have been. Needs to pay more especially since you can work everyday.
good,as soon as I get a new job I planned to wait this job my training was delayed when everyone else who showed up after me received mediate training I had to figure it all out for myself and recently ended up in the hospital. they took me off the schedule now I'm homeless.
good,"The work itself is not bad, but the management fraternizes with staff members, nepotism definitely a factor. No Consistency in polices among staff. Particular staff members are favored, if they don't like someone in their work area management will move the person whether they want to switch departments or not, just to keep their 'friend"" happy."
good,"Decent to work at, temporarily, unless you plan on getting into management. Dont get sucked into years of working there unless you want to move up. Otherwise you’ll lose a ton of time and never really get anywhere, favoritism heavy."
good,I’ve transferred stores and the first store i worked at was absolutely amazing. Every manager in there was awesome they allowed us to grow and they trained us to do better. After i moved there was too much favoritism within the store and no chance to grow if you weren’t a favorite. Although Best Buy as a company was cool this store wasn’t.
good,"Been there for 11+ years, no room for advancement within certain parts of the company. They do work well with family needs where I work. They are understanding of personal needs."
good,Low vib very sales oriented prepare to have someone in your ear telling you how poorly the store is doing every 3 minutes. Getting discounts is about the only positive thing about being a bestbuy employee
good,"Great place to work and learn about technology, its retail so work life balance is rough, worse when you get into leadership. overall a really great place to work."
good,- Great place to kick off ones Asset Protection career. I would not limit yourself to Best Buy. Always be looking for a better opportunity somewhere you can make a greater impact and your work will be appreciated.
good,"Mobile or nothing. Pay sucks till you hit management, which is unlikley in some departments. Still a fun place to work, people are usually very nice.."
good,"It was a fun place to work sometimes but some of the people got on my nerves at times and for the amount of work, the pay wasn't enough. Also some things are taken much more seriously then others."
good,Been with the company for nearly two months I've gotten 1 break working 5 hrs shifts. Honestly the coworkers are great but the turnover is pretty nuts and management seems to be a bit of a mess.
good,Fine if your pursuing management otherwise nothing spectacular except on holidays.Electronics is not 365 days a yr. booming sales so employment hrs are drastically cut after the holidays.
good,That's about it. It was just really hot all the time. Frequently the team leaders would an individuals feet to the fire for failure to meet sales goals even when the day was horribly slow.
good,"Get cheated out of promotions and equal pay. A lot of favoritism. Managers bend policy, bend over backwards for customers who treat employees poorly over little things. Management doesn’t know SOP."
good,It wasn’t too much of an enjoyable experience. The structure and procedures in which were supposed to make things quick and efficient actually made things rather difficult and tedious
good,"During my time at best buy, I received very little to no training or coaching for my job, I was uneducated on any benefits offered or my intended sales goals. This made it very hard to perform my job."
good,"just a starter job, unless you are looking to advance in the retail area."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is hard to get fired for ANYONE at the store I was at. They overlooked many of the problem employees and management micromanaged way to much. The sale goals were reasonable at first but got progressively unrealistic as time went on to the point where it caused many of the employees stress and anxiety. The employee discount was incredible and the incentives for training more often was amazing but they changed that shortly after I left. I welcomed a lot of change in that store, like upgrading the equipment and systems they used, but it seems like they are caring less and less for the employee. At least this was the case at my store."
good,Bestbuy offers one of the better retail jobs and cultures out there however it has a falloff with compensation and benefits. What I will say is that I thoroughly enjoy working there as I enjoy technology and helping people but I simply cannot afford to live on the pay they provide.
good,"Coworkers were awesome! Down fall was that there is no room for advancement, it takes years for you to even be considered a full time employee. Part time employees only get about 23 max hours per week. Management was upset that I had to call in to attend a funeral. Definitely not a permanent job, just something temporary unless you're fulltime. On select brands discounts were awesome!"
good,Buenas prestaciones y buena experiencia laboral en diferentes áreas
good,Plenty of things to keep you busy. The pay was poor compared to the labor in warehouse. No room for full time position but they had no problem with working you just short of full time hours to save on benefits.
good,I enjoyed my time at Geek Squad. But the store I was working eventually closed up and I had find another job as soon as possible. I would have held on to it for a part time job.
good,Its ok for college students who have time and want to earn some money r someone who like sales and technology. The paid is not good for what they expect you to sell
good,fast paced worked at call center performed technical support for over 3000 products. assisted customers over the phone who had problems programming a tv or getting certain products to work with products they already had
good,"The discount is great and the overtime when you can get it is amazing"
good,"BBY has worked hard returning to the marketplace with some viability after countless re-organizations in which created enormous headcount reductions impacting service, revenues and customer confidence."
good,"This is exactly what I would like to do, have lots of fun while doing the best thing that I like to do Make a Sale. I very much like to interface with customers ask questions and select the right product, accessories, protection plan, and offer them a charge card to give them the buying power."
good,"Didnt get many hours, wasnt trained at all. They told me i would be full time in the beginning but then only gave me about 10-15 hours a week. I asked to move to a different department & they said no & hired other people for the position"
good,The company is backwards they talk a out building a future but they are just stuck chasing budgets every week. Middle management are a bunch of incompetent millenials that do not know how to grow and develop talent.
good,"Facility struggled with inventory integrity making it difficult to maintain production standards."
good,A good start up for retail and customer associates looking to get their foot in the door. Learning curve is taught fairly well and prepares any potential sales associate to take on customers in mass.
good,"A typical day of work was attending customers on their computer and technology related needs. What I learned was how to troubleshoot various products of technology including: tablets, computers, televisions, gaming systems. The management needs to figure out how to not to micromanage. The hardest part was selling services that were to expensive to the client. The most enjoyable were the employees I worked with."
good,"its a good place to work, great discounts "
good,"You can have a great time working at best buy, or it can be a really terrible place to work. You don't really get to choose. A lot of turnover because of low pay (as with most retailers) or people getting tired of not moving up."
good,"best buy is a great company to work for but to be honest this site in general is extremely inconsistent when it comes to dress code, attendance, really just over all rules, they definitely go off of favoritism in this site. they give us a hand ful of pto to use but tell us how we can use 48 hours of it."
good,"Awesome people to work with, weak leaders and reactionary, afraid and really stale bureaucratic structure."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it was an amazing job. Some management was awesome others would be questionable. My only issue was someone I worked with and they wouldn't handle it. Constant changes in technology keep you on your toes. Credit Card applications were needed based on hours worked but it wasn't hard to get them.
good,"I felt they said they didn't care about your sales for the day but they tracked them each day and you were verbally reprimanded if they were low.  Often I worked during slow times so my job was to stock and clean, while others who worked busier times had higher sales."
good,Work-Life Balance is terrible but the bonuses are good. It was 60+ hours constantly and always holidays and weekends. The money is good but when you weight out the hours you make less than anywhere else.
good,I worked at best buy for a few years. Under one manager I was on tract to move up but after he changed stores that all ended. They tend to promote who they like and not always who would be best for the job.
good,"Overall good company. Lots of good policies in place for both staff and customers, decent training programs, smart and caring managers, and a great employee discount."
good,"I really did enjoy the job at first. I would do training, help customers with the best suitable options for them, and it was rewarding. We did fun events, had a decent amount of freedom. After a while, it slowly starting to turn into pure sales and numbers. It was no longer about helping customers, but rather trying to get them to spend as much as possible. We had to track everything and we would get written up if we didn't meet certain goals. That was really what caused me to look elsewhere."
good,for the most part the job can become repetitive. I believe that unless your a full-time employee its hard for you to appreciate the job because you don't have access to the same benefits. however as a part-time job its amazing. great work environment. customers can be a pain at times but thats with any job.
good,I enjoyed working for the company but when I was ready and trained to advance in the company I was held back by my supervisor for her mistakes as a horrible higher up.
good,"A typical day at work would usually consist of greeting costumers, directing them in the location of certain products, spending time with each costumer and making sure they are satisfied with everything. My coworkers were always very friendly and more then happy to help if i had any questions."
good,"Easy work, always busy with something. Warehouse people were cool. Management sucks but it is what it is. Came in early mornings which I liked because you leave early in the day."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a great inbetween job for me, as it gave me some income between when I left school and began my full-time job. Some of the things I didn't like about Best Buy were that the hours weren't guaranteed, unless you counted 8-16 hours as guaranteed. Overall a decent place to work if you need a job and are in high school, or just need some supplementary income."
good,"Hectic, fast paced, and inconsistent. During the Holiday season it was very usual to have a lot of chaos as with any retail. This job even though it would be a mad house was very easy and direct."
good,Its not a bad place to work but it seems like there is almost no room for advancement. Full time means anywhere between 32-41 hours depending on how the managers feel. Pay could be better. I'm currently full time and struggling to hold on.
good,Best Buy is a great first job for anybody coming out of high school or currently in college. The company was flexible with employees schedules and the environment was loose. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with customers about products that would help them in their daily lives.
good,"People know what they want when they walk into a Best Buy, but the main goal for the company is to upcharge everything. People have budgets but Best Buy doesn’t care"
good,"I worked at Best Buy for almost 5 years.  They gave me great sales experience, but once I became great at what I do, I noticed that the pay was absolutely horrible compared to others who work in sales.  At the time, it wasn't bottom line pay, but it wasn't enough to raise a family on.  It also got very stressful because they pushed and pushed budgets and sales, but you were paid the same no matter how much you sold or how many credit card sign ups you got."
good,"BestBuy is a great place to work, but could benefit from a bit less of a clique environment. Every BestBuy seems to be this way, as I've worked in a few. However, it seems to be more of who you are friends with that gets you advanced, less based on skill and potential."
good,"I enjoyed working with Best Buy in the Product Process department. We got to set up displays,  open brand new gadgets and maintain the flow of inventory in the store. Product process often has early morning shifts, sometimes overnights. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy Whitehall pa is not flexible they make excuses to not help they rely on employees to teach other employees without proper training. The managers are unprofessional and rude.
good,"You are expected to over produce with no recognition. The tasks are not hard, but you are expected to pick up the slack of other employees while they have no restrictions."
good,"Can be a great place to work depending on WHICH best buy you are at."
good,I loved working with the customers and employees but the supervisory staff was lacking in employee relations.  I also loved working with the technology.
good,"This job was a good job if you were just starting out in work, as someone with military experience, this job was below what I had to offer and I did not get the chance to offer the company anything good."
good,This position does not exist in the company anymore so my review probably doesn't really matter. Project Team is a very under paid and under appreciated position in general. 2/10 do not recommend.
good,"You spend your day fixing Customer computers, answering questions from salesman from the floor, and depending on how well you do your job, you'll likely be assigned more duties outside of outlined role."
good,"Did this job as a high school student, and it did well to give me some discretionary income. I wasn't supervised very much, and the training was nonexistent. The pay was decent though."
good,"The job itself isn't bad, however, from my experience with the company management uses the tactic of tearing others down to lift one up. That contributed to low employee morale throughout the entirety of the store."
good,"Greet customers, inform them about deals and check them out after they complete their purchase. If they have any issues we simply try and help them if they have all the information that we need to help them."
good,"Geeksquad has an interesting fun culture that you can appreciate and enjoy and all though it is considered cervices it is still attached to a retail company Best Buy and as such you are subjected to retail hours, working holidays and weekends. That being said retail has a lot to teach and if your willing to learn, it is invaluable experience that you can take with you to your next part of you career."
good,Working in Best Buy was overall a good experience. However Best Buy does not care if their employees are unhappy. In order for your business to thrive your employees have to feel like they matter
good,The office is in a nice building on the 4th floor. It's a clean environment. I dress nice appropriate for this line of work. I don't work weekends or holidays.
good,"You get burnt out working long hours and every weekend and holiday, but better than most retail options. Pay could be better but they make up for it with competitive benefits"
good,"Generally a good place to work but, management needs to be vastly improved. A typical day at work consisted of processing invoices for customer online orders."
good,"It wasn't for long that I was there, but it was enjoyable for the most part.  People were nice and I learned some unique things about technology.  I was not really encouraged to grow in the company, even though I was a good team player and proactive associate."
good,"After you are there for so many years and still never get at least a little time off with your family or schedule accommodations, you get burnt out."
good,Great first-time job for someone fresh out of HighSchool. would not make a career out of it even the manager spots come and go and the pay vs the time you put in each day is not a good work life balance specially come the holidays
good,"Loved it when I started. After 9 months got bored. Switched to sales, loved it again, supervior quit, new one introduced and the guy was underqualified for the position and has made working there dreadful. Can be great to work there and I excel but this guy micromanages so much he might as well be sitting on your shoulders. Managers make or break your experience here."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Inventory workload is way to much for just one person.  Management was ok but only cared about sales numbers and nothing else. Overall good place to learn how retail works.
good,Great place to start working with out of high school and while in college. Best Buy always made sure to take care of its employees. The people I worked with were great and wanted to get better every single day.
good,Management was horrible. When we had little department meetings or get together they would be some what fun. Management moved on there own time at certain times when they felt like things weren’t as important as the things they were doing at that specific moment.
good,"Best Buy is a decent place to work at. Good benefits, paid training and lots of flexibility. Working at Best Buy you are required to stay on top of classes and expectations just like any other jobs who requires to do so. Personally I did learn how to grow my sales skills including my customer service skills. Management is a little rough. At certain locations it is said, ""What have you done lately for me economy"". Meaning to get anywhere or to advance you need to always, no matter what, have their back. But don't expect to much for them to do the same for you. Working a non-commissioned based career, management and the sales floor culture is extremely cut throat. There are numbers and goals to meet just like any other business who demands so, personally, Best Buy seems to be stricter when it comes to so. The most enjoyable part of working at Best Buy are the people you meet along the way and the knowledge that you gain."
good,"It was a good experience I manafed to end 1st 2nd and 3rd in sales a lot of times, but after the season was gone they never called me, they put my hopes up telling me if I work hard enough I might keep the job, I did, and then they just let me go."
good,"It helped point me in the write direction in terms of my career goals, but it was just a job at the end of the day. Often restricted by their own rules and regulations."
good,8+ years 
good,"Had this as a seasonal job for the holidays. I was mostly self trained, I would go through and restock the media department, organize and update the department following weekly updates."
good,"cons:"
good,Best buy can be fun if you are a techy person.  Learn a lot about different products and lot of great co-workers.  Sucky thing is it is all about your numbers.  Get written up over missing one sales goal.   Management staff is terrible at motivating and will sometimes hold useless meetings early morning to punish the department.  I have been to best buys that are really fun and have a great team.  Such as 1513 and 224.  051 manager is terrible !   Black Friday sucks!
good,I think this is a great place to work for students. The discount received is a great perk but unless you just love retail i would not make it a career.
good,"Over worked, under paid and not appreciated for all the time given. Poor management. lack of communication with employees. Moving our jobs and leaving us with no work. Cut our pay by more than half."
good,"satisfactory work experience, not much job security. One of the benefits was being able to work with many different types of technology. constant learning and educational opportunities available."
good,"-They don't listen to days you need off for being out of town"
good,"This Job is very flexible as far as scheduling . It is tough to grow financially within the company."
good,The management is all about favoritism here and even with seniority if you don't have a hand in with the managers you won't advance. The discounts are very good because you only pay 5% above what the store purchases the product wholesale for. So that is nice.
good,Positif:
good,Best Buy had great management they’re a good company to work for with a lot of health benefits including 401(k) insurance and tuition reimbursement.!.
good,"Very competitive, stressful and fast-paced work.  Have to work 8 hrs or less standing and moving. The management is very communicative and stresses that you have to achieve the sales quota for the day."
good,"The job was too stressful and too many lay offs after spending 6 years with the company. I went to work with a different company after 6 years, I could not comprehend the pay stress and the benefits that I got with the company. I left to go to a new company with a better environment and pay also better benefits."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Discounts and pay is more than fair, good paid time off, just a rather boring place to work. Traffic is inconsistent so there is lots of down time in most stores. Management live in their own little world almost everywhere you go. Reasoning isn't a thing, just revenue."
good,"It was a great atmosphere with fun people to be around, however it was Best Buy and people (customers) so much love the activity of putting down the employees that work there. Customers were the most difficult part of the job."
good,I worked here for most of my career and met many great people.  It was very discouraging to be told my work was on longer important enough for them to keep my position.
good,"If you work hard and make friends with the people who do promotions, you will do ok there, but if you do not, then you get stuck as a part time employee going no where. Sales goals get to be a little silly."
good,"On the whole, it's not a bad place to work, but retail, in general, is stressful, and can lead to improper handling of people. Managers need to learn when to grab people to help, and recognize when a person is available, or may need a few minutes to get to a point where they can help."
good,"BB does not let managers manage their large teams. Managers and supervisors are buried in checklists, reviews, and busy paperwork. You don't have time to help people get better or really take care of your customers. Cookie cutter tools and resources do not always fit every individual,"
good,Depends on store management whether you will like it or not because can be easily toxic. hours are flexible and pay is decent if a student while the discount is a plus.
good,The general manager was a tyrant that harassed and demeaned employees. The management team played favoritism and it was difficult to advance if you weren't a favorite. They also criticized and punished others for things they allowed their favorites to get away with.
good,continuos work. lots of interaction with clients. climate controlled. hours based on sales. sales driven. tons of learning moduals that must be done in a specific time period
good,"I started at BestBuy as a seasonal employee and after the seasonal time period... I got hired as a Part-Timer. I've learned many things working at Best Buy. I learned how to interact with customers. I learned how to carry out the many tasks that was being assigned to me in the Home Theater, PC and Digital Imaging departments. I learned how to challenge myself and educate myself  on  BestBuy's products and overall customer service. The overall workplace culture was great. Employees were very friendly and supportive to myself as well as the customers. A typical day at work would be a customer coming in, having questions about a product, informing them about the many different protection plans depending on their product... followed by ringing the customer up and ensuring they had the best experience. Personally, a manager apart of the managing team who  was supposed to be in charge of my training in other fields of the store and in charge on my scheduling never really took charge. The hardest part of the job was constantly switching departments and only working one day a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many different diverse customers and being able to assist their wants and needs."
good,Its hard to compete with online stores that offer better prices and greater inventory. But it was a decent job with some benefits. I enjoyed working in the inventory department because of the daily challenges that presented themselves.
good,"I know for a fact that at least the best buy I worked at played favorites. I worked in home theater and on slow days I would go to the car bay to talk to my coworker and he even would agree... workers here at that job do not get paid what they are worth. It is incredibly hard to go anywhere with the job at all, unless you basically brown nose management. Though this is a retail job, it makes decent money, getting a raise is extremely tough too. And of course, they will constantly hire more part-timers to cut the hours you need/want so you can support yourself and family."
good,"This cut throat sales position isnt for everyone, but it can be fun. walk the sales floor and hunt for cash holders. upsell upsell upsell. pretty easy once you get the hang of it."
good,decent job for a high school student or a college student. You will learn about a lot of technology. most likely you will have good vibes and good relationships working here.
good,If you don't mind manual labor and staying late 95% of the time. it's a fun job. The people that work inventory are usually early 20s but most if not all worked hard and dealt with the demands.
good,Management is really all over the place and you get told too many different things to do at once. Not consistent with hours and they cut hours when you do bad at selling. Barely help you to really train and get better at the job
good,"During christmas time it's a good place to work,"
good,"Started out great. I was number one on my bosses list for work ethic. i then joined PT and got a 3 dollar bump. it was fun at first because i got to travel. then i got home sick so i transferred back home. this store seemed good number one in the city but then i arrived. managment is never on the same page, our GM was a jerk, and our ops manager was an awkward jerk who tried to be nice."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working during the holidays is frustrating but very manageable. I feel that feedback around performance isn't very insightful, especially when performance is directly linked to store traffic. If the store is busy, you have a productive day, but if it isn't then your numbers are low and one on ones don't seem to take that into consideration. Additionally scheduling is very inconsistent during non-holiday periods"
good,It was a job. It got me hours and helped me pay bills. I got entirely too stressed out to work there sometimes. It wasn't totally bad.................
good,"Working at best buy isn't anything special. As far as the retail world its a step up from working at Target or Walmart. That really doesn't say a lot. I worked their during the holiday season as a temp. I was offered a full time position but had to turn it down. Job just didn't pay enough. Discount is decent 5% above cost which is huge on some items and no discount on others."
good,"We would have incentives like getting to pie our managers and supervisors."
good,"BB DC was a fast paced work place. I started in dotcom, shipping products, moved to repack to pick products, then was taught replenishing of product for the pickers. The hardest part of job were some heavy lifting of products, especially from second level shelves. The part I enjoyed was making sure my area was stocked properly, with correct count in the bins. "
good,overall enjoyed working there but as time when on the workload increased alot but was the only person that did my job at the warehouse.  I enjoyed the variety of work that I  did.
good,"Worked in a non heated/ air conditioned warehouse and wasn't allowed to take breaks. Consistently understaffed and lack or care from management. Management did not hold laziness or careless employees accountable, and chose when to enforce rules."
good,"standing all day, very little management involvement and if so it is erratic feeling. Helping customers find items that are not in your area of expertise. Co workers can be fun to work with. Company systems that are very slow and can be hard to work with at times"
good,"This was a very fast paced, sales environment with heavy emphasis on customer service. It was the first job I had after having my daughter and it got me back to where I needed to be after being off for a couple years. The management was fair along with workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was the pressure of having to meet sales targets while giving the impression that you are not working under commission to the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job were some of the perks you could take advantage of with discounted cell service etc."
good,Cleaning and keeping an eye out for anyone in need of help. organizing the video games and keeping up with video game news and upcoming development of video games.
good,"Too many people calling angry at their results at Best Buy, when calling Technical Support is not the correct answer for their issue, they don't seem to understand that they need to go back to the store they bought the device from."
good,"-Flexible work schedules"
good,It started as a seasonal job that turned into a part time job. The mixture of young and older employees was a good one at the Katy store #354. I didn't see it as a career for myself but it was a cool job.
good,Do everything and get low wages for it. No good for adults who have bills that need to be payed. It is great for part time work. Not much more that needs to be said.
good,I do the same thing every day at work. Every morning I either replace old price tags with updated prices or scan some departments for open spots where there is no merchandise and try to find the merchandise and keep the department stocked. My supervisor is lenient when it comes to scheduling. If I ask him to give me less hours during a certain week because of exams he will not mind changing my schedule for that week.
good,"Overall, The Best buy I work for is a great place. I love the people I work with and the customers are great for the most part. The only thing that I am unhappy with is the inconsistency of working hours, One week I get 10 or less then the next I get over 30. I am not a highschool student. I am a college graduate who needs to pay bills and live.  I also believe that Best Buy should offer their part time employees health insurance. It's not right that it is not offered. I've worked for a bank for 6 years prior. Always part time due to school. But even part timers were given health care."
good,Call center inside of a warehouse. The job was pretty cool but Best Buy has had some struggles in profitability and have had lay off a couple times. They also could not seem to keep anyone in upper management. With every new Director there were new rules
good,"You might as well work on the sales floor you get paid just as much and your job will entail tons less.  Less restrictions and requirements and less Training.  Geek Squad used to be the place to work, used to get paid twice the amount the sales floor does (for good reason too) but anymore being in geek squad is equivalent to being a red-headed stepchild (Best Buy's red headed step child) its not a good environment."
good,Good place to start a career especially while your young. Best Buy has many opportunities from retail to corporate to district. Great incentives and competitive.
good,"To advance you better have friends in high places. You also better have been with the company 10+ years. Most the management level opportunities are brainless so anyone can do them, which allows upper management to bring up the person that's been around the longest. So get in line if you want to move up."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is quite relaxed. There are some days when it is very busy and some it is not. Management can be here or there sometimes but you would have at least one you could go to with issues. Peer accountability is something that could be worked on. otherwise, its a great place to work."
good,"Being remote, the day begins with turning on the computer and clocking in. Opening all programs needed, then pulling from the queue to assist clients as fast as possible. Breaks aren't scheduled and a lunch needs to be fit in as you can manage. Managers tend to be very hard to get in touch with when needed, especially outside of the 9-5 of their timezone, which may not be yours. Team members are not on the same shifts, so who's available for assistance can vary. The culture can both be very good and very poor, as with most places. The best part of it is helping someone get up and running and fixing their issues. It's fantastic. The hardest part is trying to do that for multiple people at once, for the ever increasing minimum requirement."
good,Auditing 6 month Business Analyst position. Not much to tell there were very specific task to be completed by the contractors that the full time staff did not have time tocomplete.
good,I didn't appreciate the demeaning attitude directed by management. Salary was unfair as it wasn't based on effort applied. I disagree with their employee recognition model as well.
good,"The geek squad culture was great at the time of my working there, and I quit mostly because that was being compromised because the management of the Best Buy we were in were over-managing us and causing a significant amount of stress and strain to staff and customers alike"
good,"Your day can be fast, or slow. Always pushed sales relentlessly, and did not offer commission. Often did not feel like a team, and the work culture didn't feel as open."
good,"good benefits,management is not that good , you get alot of good discounts and they have a very nice team working with them , management needs to be improved alot"
good,"Most of the time I enjoy working at Best Buy but some employees make it difficult to enjoy work because we all have a quota to make, and they let that get in the way of having a fair fun time at work."
good,in the first week I learned that what they taught for A+ worked half the time - did a lot of home work!- watched people being accompanied out the door daily by managers yelling about getting a lawyer (after being mislead to by sales)
good,"A typical day at work consists of morning paperwork and calls as well as starting any repairs or new pcs that need to be set up. When the store opens, there are typically client's waiting to give us grieve over having to make reservations for them to ensure we can sit down for fifteen minutes to give a simple diagnosis and to get as much information from the client as possible to aid in the repairs. In our downtime, we typically push out functionality checks on devices that were returned by customers inside of best buy, we will check client devices coming from our service centers, or verifying that all materials are present when sending stock to product rectlimation."
good,"Well, its a job... I really don't know much more I can say. I feel Best Buy would be a great college job. However, I'm thankful for the opportunity I was given."
good,"Constant restructures put more and more work on fewer people creating a high stress environment with less and less room to succeed. Was a great company to work for 5 years ago, now not so much."
good,"If you are a person that will thrive in a sales driven environment, you might like working at Best Buy. Every position in a Best Buy retail store is expected to achieve sales/productivity goals based on corporate standards. It is a fast paced work environment where you will interact with people on a daily basis."
good,"Starting in 2010 and being there for near 5 years, it was a steady decline with what I thought was the best place to ever work.  Shortly after my mother unexpectedly passed, I was told by the HR manager I had been given ample time to ""get over it"" which crossed the line for me.  She was later found guilty for fraud against her last employer.  Karma.  Would not recommend for a ""career"""
good,Management never seems to have a clue whats going on and tends to avoid working as often as possible. Will always inform you have how bad you're doing but never offer any new instruction on how to improve. Same conversations every month about your metrics.
good,"The staff are absolutely some of the best people you will come across, and is the best work environment to be around."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for six years For the first two, I was a part time employee working 30 hours a week as sales associate. For the last four, I was fortunate enough to remain on as a seasonal employee working holidays and in the summer when I returned home from school."
good,"Having worked for Best Buy for 4 years, I have developed a deep understanding of the company. It is a fair job, definitely a step up from Walmart or Kmart, but having the hindsight to look back at my time in my store in particular in state college, it was a fairly miserable experience. The managers were truly the worst part, poor experience, examples, and inconsistencies all around have led this to just being my college job for needed money. There were obviously good points, but looking back that was due to my co-workers and I having fun."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The leads made sure their team was knowledgeable on every product not just in their specific department, in order to help every customer out. They made sure if we didn't know too much about the product, we were able to ask someone who was for further assistance."
good,At first this was a great place to work when compared to Sears but after about 6 months it becomes tiresome  and repetitive. Hard to stay motivated when you feel favoritisms an issue.
good,"I was trying to advance in this company for months and they wouldn't promote me, kept promising promotions and that I'd get it next month or after Christmas. Needless to say I never got the promotion because they were just empty lies to keep me content."
good,"Good Transitional Job, but not for long term employment."
good,my experience while working with geek squad gave me a lot of new skills being able to work with customers in a frustrating environment and also to do basic troubleshooting
good,Working is at BB is cool. Alot of young kids and older adults work there. This job is flexible to my lifestyle. I work temp jobs and this job works well around my full time job.
good,severely under work you. i was told i would get 25 hours a week and got anywhere from 5-15. Employee benefits are extremely nice but you never work enough to buy anything. managers are fun and caring along with all other employees. i wish they would hire less people per department so we could all not struggle so much
good,"Unless it is a holiday season or you are a full-timer, hours are very limited.  It was a great place to work fun learning new technologies and teaching those who were a bit behind.  Its just the poor hours if you are just a part-timer."
good,"Overall it was not the worst place to work, but hours varied from few to none (my schedule ranged from 0-25 hours per week)."
good,"Depending who is on the team (GM, Supervisors, Leads, etc...) it can make or break a store. When I started working at BB it was a great environment, we had a great GM who gave an entire store raised based on performance and had a connection with everybody. After the GM stepped down a new one came about and turned the store completely over. I understand not everybody has to be a fun GM but the one we had received was not experienced to work in this environment and in such a big store and a lot of employees left. They should do a better job of getting the right people for the job, such as hiring from within. Good job if you"
good,"Best Buy is a great stepping stone job to get into the world of technology, IT and sales. Cross training with a wide range of technology solutions, and technical training."
good,"The company creed, and the beliefs of store level management are never on the same page. So be prepared to get very contradicting direct. There is never clear cut information available"
good,It was ok management wasnt all that great. They were really clicky if you get what I mean. They only was giving me short shifts not really worth my bills.
good,"This job can be fun at times, but the store I worked in at terrible leadership causing a negative employee experience.  I loved the Customers and the culture of what the Geek Squad represents.  It was fun having music playing all day and interacting with different Agents from a wide variety of sales and IT backgrounds."
good,"This is a decent position to learn customer service, but the job is lacking mainly in the way of compensation. Constant push to sell more, but no commission, and no real incentive for customer associates."
good,"Night shift wasn't bad, management was fairly relaxed. The work load was minimal and the pay was good for a starter job. Standing for long hours was the worst part of the job."
good,"They really push certain agendas on you, which is the nature of a salesperson, but can lack personal touch which doesn't really help get the message across a lot of times. If management took more time to do more training it would be beneficial to the employees as it would come more natural to them as they practice what they are expected to do."
good,"The company I worked for was National Electronics Warranty (NEW).  Best Buy sold our warranties on their big appliances or electronics, even cell phones.  Customers would call in when needing service repairs and we would schedule service.  I enjoyed working for this company.  However their attendance was based off a points system.  I believe that caused a pressure and stress in the work environment."
good,"If you are passionate about anything that Best Buy sells, it's a good place to work. Getting retail sales experience is a plus. If you expect to progress into management for Best Buy, get a degree. Geek squad is a lot of fun, but if you're driven by money, start your own computer repair or home theater sales/install business."
good,I love the store Best Buy but there is bad management. I've seen managers do inappropriate things in the workplace as well as discriminate employees because of race and gender.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I liked my job, but various issues came up to cause me to seek new employment. One of which was the yearly raise. Best Buy limited their employees to a maximum $0.03 raise annually. When I look for a job I look for the longevity it would provide. I couldn't see myself working for over thirty years to reach $10.00 per hour. Next was management. The management team was professional to a certain point, but in a small store like 605 they tended to spare the rod and spoil the child if they liked you. There should have been several cases of employees being reprimanded, but it was just laughed off. If it weren't for these two issues I would have loved this place."
good,"Prepare yourself to learn alone, not much time is given to understand the task to do correctly. The responsables aren't very professional and they seem not to care."
good,Sold computers and accessories. I learned sales skills and how to navigate a point of sales. Stocking procedures and pricing skills.
good,"they just never offer full time positions to OS workers. Loved working there but ran out of time. "
good,"As an former employee at best buy, I have to say I liked it especially with my co-workers and managers. The only down fall was that I wasn't able to work there very long because after the holidays it wasn't busy enough so I was only able to work there temporary for the holidays."
good,"check it out and see what you think. cool co-workers, terrible management. its a nice warehouse, with plenty of products to day dream about buying. other than that it's a regular 9-5"
good,Good company to start out in of for part time but bad management choices and little quick advancement up the ladder if any management staff do not like you very biased on discipline and do not get full story before decisions.
good,"Did not work well with my full-time student schedule.  Management was not the best, and the employees were not very helpful."
good,good coworkers most of the time because they can associate with what you as an employee have to go through just like they have to go through.
good,"This job as a cashier was ok, I expected much more from Best Buy. At the time I was working way more than I thought I should have been paid."
good,"Unrealistic expectations, pay is too low, and trying to move up is like playing Game of Thrones. Customers treat employees terribly and advertisements set unrealistic expectations of employees"
good,"Best Buy is a good company. The mobile department in particular was a great atmosphere. One thing I disapproved of was the aggression towards employees on selling add-on, such as protection plans to customers."
good,"Working at Best Buy helped me gain cashier experience and how to sell product protection plans. I can personally say working at Best Buy did not give me any electronic or any product knowledge. Employees were also not allowed to sit during their shifts, even with no customers around."
good,"Best Buy is the typical retail company. I wouldn't expect much in terms of benefits or compensation. being that it is a retail job, I never expected a very flexible schedule either. it is however a very healthy environment and great place to work."
good,"No life and work balance , no flexibility at all, all contracted hours are set in stone .they are severely understaffed for the length of time tasks take."
good,"Overall great job, pay was great. I felt that the management left me to fend for myself after about 2 days so I felt lost for awhile, but overall I enjoyed who I worked directly with."
good,It was a sales position for selling Home Theater and Audio. I sold all kinds of TV's and audio systems of all kinds of manufactures.
good,"Typical retail sales job. They realllllly want you to sell the warranties, since the margin is so good on them. They always push on you to focus on those, but you get no commission or incentive for doing so, other than not getting yelled at. They only give benefits to FT employees and it is really hard to get promoted to FT. You often work FT hours as a PT employee."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I did not get the feeling BestBuy cared about the customers. I couldn't just help the customer find what they needed. I was constantly warned that if I did not sell the guest a credit card that I could lose my job.  I would go up to every customer to see if they needed assistance. usually helping them find some sort of wire. Helped old ladies buy their first computer. And mothers find games for their kids.
good,"Dealing with Day to Day clients and customers who at times can be very tedious at times including management. Especially when it comes down to GeekSquad Service Sales. Your expected to push GSP (Geek Squad Services) every day and are criticized if you don't ""Sale"" enough, Professional ethics discarded just so you can sell the ""Best Option"" for the client even if the best option isn't an option the client/customer can buy, but learn."
good,"Fun place to work, fun employees and atmosphere. Holidays are a busy but fun time to work for this company and they make it fun."
good,"Good experience, I learned how to manage direct reporters and drive sales through targets and coaching. Working in the Oakville location was much better than Downsview."
good,"Best Buy store 212 easily has the best managers I have worked with. They care about their employees and know their stuff. That said, the fact that I was denied the privilege of a thanksgiving dinner or Christmas eve makes me hate the work entirely. Furthermore, the expectation that we sell a certain amount of credit cards (i.e. put a certain number of people into debt for sake of a sale) is something I take moral issue with."
good,"Great job if you're a student looking for something flexible. Hard job, dealing with angry customers. Have to learn how to take in that negative feedback even if it isn't necessarily your fault. Just wasn't a great job for me."
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work, building relationships with fellow employees and learning about new and upcoming products was fun and infomative."
good,7+ years of experience with the company.  Problems: the go gets change based on your past district visit.  Pros:They are generally trying to get it right.
good,"during my time at Best Buy, overall i did have a solid relationship with management and my colleagues. I just personally felt that the company would always eliminate positions."
good,It was an awesome job I didn't dislike it I just needed something that had more hours and I set schedule my schedule is always changing their I was a full-time employee who wasn't getting up for 30 hours a week.
good,"Working in this department, you often feel undervalued, more is expected of you than of other departments, and yet less is given back. "
good,"typical day at work, never take your stress out on customer's "
good,"In my experience, I never had issues up until the end of my Best Buy career. The pay is subpar considering how good I was at my job. There was no attempt to keep me there until way after the fact I was leaving. They had new hire making anywhere from 1-2 dollars more than me which was disheartening. Overall, I got tired of the place."
good,Typical corporate large scale business. The salespeople were down to earth because they take a verbal beating everyday on the job and upper management seemed like corporate monkeys who only focus on doing what the higher-ups tell them to do.
good,"Working at was a good experience, Best Buy had a fun and welcoming environment which made it easy for new employees as myself to fit in the workplace."
good,"High turnover, unrealistic expectations, poor work/life balance, decent compensation.  Company claims to care about their employees development, training, work/life balance, but does not stand up for them."
good,"This was a temporary job on the Geek Squad. Very interesting place to work. Loved the location in Edwardsville. However, most of the time my login password did not work for some reason. So I was unable to ring up some sales."
good,"Met some really great people that provided more information about how things were run than the actual management. Learned interesting things about computers and other electronics I didn't know beforehand. Problem is, again, the management. You don't work on commission, but they pressure you to sell a lot of Geek Squad Protection services to a point where that gets placed before customer service. But when you're placed in a department where the difficulty of selling GSP drastically increases, it's obviously impossible to manage your given quotas. Was constantly pressured into selling GSP, but never given the proper resources in how to properly do so."
good,"You know that feeling you get when you walk into a store after just being there a week ago and saying ""Wow, everything is different, where did ___ go?"" Well, chances are that was me. Operations and Merch was responsible for how the store looked on any given day. Map changes and Planogram's. The where, how and when any items or fixtures should be out on the sales floor. "
good,It was a good job with great people. Didn't have management back up employees. The benefits were not that great. The hardest part of the job would have to be closing the store .
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Responsible for ringing up customers in a timely manner and guaranteeing high level of customer service."
good,it not what you know at best buy. its who you know and how you know them if you want to move up and why you do move up it take over your hole life.but if your a full timer or part time its ok tho.
good,It was fun to learn about the products for this company and also has amazing co workers to work with its just the management that needs more work
good,"I worked at BB for 4 years in different positions, and most of the bad times can be chalked up to entitled customers not get the royal treatment when they have the slightest inconvenience, which because its retail, is all the time."
good,"the employees are great but under valued, employees need to be listened to and take the suggestions since they are on the floor everyday."
good,I didn't like the management at the workplace because I found most of the managers to be very lazy. They didn't perform their best on a daily basis. So that demotivated other employees to do better.
good,Everything was really goal orientated. People with no sales abilities were disregarded in the company. Management only cares about results. Many incompetent managers that held position.
good,The overall job as far as expectations and learning opportunities were great but the management seemed to show favoritism and some of the management allowed certain people to not have to be accountable for actions or non-actions
good,"Its a good job because it always keeps me in tune with the latest and greatest technology,along with allow a smooth environment in which to interact with customers."
good,"Best Buy is great for a college job, and a job that allows you to learn about the tech sector and learning leadership skills."
good,Working at Best Buy was a good experience to vital selling skills and helped with the progress of personal communication advancement.
good,"BestBuy is a good company to work for if you are attending school. However, if you are looking for a career I would suggest looking for a place with more room to move up."
good,"The job is a really good place especially the management, however I have been trying to move to the sales floor for about a month now. I'm not planning on staying much longer as I want to move up and find a better job in my career field."
good,"I worked with great people, most managers were very nice and helpful. However, overall guidelines and job duties were repetitive and wasteful of time. My training was atrocious forcing me to learn on the fly, managers did not really care to train but expected work to be perfect. Working with customers is the best part here."
good,"Close to no chance to get a promotion, or just negotiate a salary bump."
good,"Although best buy is a a fun place to work, the overall values of the company are terrible.  They except us to sell thousands of dollars worth of product with attachments, protects, services, and yet they cant have us working on commission? That is probably my biggest beef with BBY other than the Managers that I  dealt with.  the employees are treated unfairly by upper management and have an unreasonable amount of expectations to be met. "
good,"good job, love talking to customer and providing my expertise on product they may need help with. Co- workers also great to be around."
good,"Job atmosphere is quite friendly. The shortcoming working at the location I work is that the work hours offered are very limited. It is a high  paced, retail environment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This was a great start up company that is solely based off contracts. Great company to work for if you are looking for labor work held contracts with multiple fortune 500 companies
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but their way of getting rid of seasonal employees leaves something to be desired. Alas, the job itself was alright."
good,"Best Buy is Best Buy! Simply put it was fun. When your department is firing on all cylinders and the numbers are looking great and leadership takes a step back, everything is fun! But when Managers and above start to change things, with little to no communication on what you are suppose to change. And when that message changes almost on a daily cadence, things become messy."
good,I had the worse and good experience but already it was a great environment but growing into the company for a good living is not worth investing your time.
good,Working at Best Buy allowed me to expand my horizons and develop a part of my working self . I was able to learn a side of the consumer business and implement knowledge that i have gained throughout the years.
good,"Typical day consists of trying to get people to sign up for credit card, selling protection, and dealing with angry customers who are mad because best buy can't deliver working appliances."
good,"Work tasks are easy to understand and easily to accomplish. Most of what I learned at work was taught to me buy random co-workers on the spot. Not much training from a specific person was done. Co-workers were easy to work with but sometimes the amount of work needed to be done was not done on time due to a short period of time and very short work hours. There were many employees but a small portion of them were ever full time. Works hours were only posted at the end of the every two weeks so if you did not work towards the weekend, you had a harder time figuring out your schedule. Scheduled work days were very random but averaged out to about 20+ hours every two weeks. Overall the job was somewhat enjoyable but needs a little more organization."
good,Decent job. Not very easy to move up in the company. Most of the managers dont really recognize your hard work because the store is so big. Most of the employees are never properly trained. They use videos to train their employees and expect it to be a full college course of training. But its a good job to start in if you are not looking for much to grow in.
good,"I worked for Best Buy when it was Future Shop.  I was there for 8 years. Upon my time there i was moved twice into different positions thus learning how to run most of the store. However, the way the staff was projected to strive for numbers instead of quality was concerning for me.  It seemed that money was more important than the customers experience.  I was overlooked on several occasions to move into sales as i was told that i'm ""Operations material, not sales."" I would have appreciated the chance yet it seem that you had to be friends with the manager for that to happen.  Hardest part of my job was seeing how things were done with such difficulty when they really didn't need to be.  I would find simplistic ways of completing the same task yet it was frowned upon.  The only joy I had there was the people....some of them.  Not  the clicks."
good,"It was fairly good, management was mediocre. Overall I would recommend it to start in the field of IT. The culture is absolutely amazing, black ties and clients are fun ""lingo""."
good,Not too much to say. It was more so the manager that was over the department that I worked in rather than the company. The store manager is fantastic but the rest of the managers needed a course in how to be a true leader.
good,"Management is terrible. Managers do nothing but walk around pretending to do something. You ask for help and they just ignore you. New comers are improperly trained, they are just thrown into a department and left to learn it themselves. The motto is have fun while being the best. You can be the best and not have fun at all. Other than that its just another job."
good,"Best part of the job was helping old school customer to understand technical thing about the phone. Numbers was a most, how many product or service sales, with no compensecion!"
good,"Pay is pretty standard for retail sales. Technical knowledge is not required. Customer service, mild technical support and retail sales. General store upkeep. Schedule can vary from week to week."
good,"I worked in both the store and on corporate level merchandising (Project Team). Working in store gave more experience and more possibility to move up in the company. Project team on the other hand, did not have as many opportunities, there is no set schedule, and the management I had, did not have employees best interests in mind."
good,There are some good people and there are some bad.  Same as anywhere.  Just stay on the managers good side and you will be ok.
good,"Management is only worried about making money, doesn't care about their employees. Scheduling is terrible. Never enough coverage. Favoritism is strong in my location."
good,Cool place to work and a lot of interesting people to be around. Something always new to learn and be apart of. The fortune 500 company offers a lot of long term benefits
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Cool place to work, management was poor when I was there. Other then that I enjoyed the discount and the environment of other employees..."
good,"I had a great amount of respect and fondness for the staff and management. The customers were great. I had a lot of opportunity to develop my customer service skills. I would have like to stay, if the compensation and hours were better."
good,I loved working with the regular customers. It is a very busy active changing environment. Great work environment for people wanting to move up in the retail area.
good,There was a of variety in what I did each day. I Take pride in the work I perform to help out every client ..Management can be more supportive and consider employee feedback.Hard work goes unnoticed. Small team should have access to continue to learn/take courses to engage employees more and receive proper certification
good,This place was a lot of fun for awhile but then people were being hired and fired for the dumbest reasons. People were promoted because they were liked more instead having the right skill set for the job.
good,"Best Buy is a nice place to work. There are some opportunities that are very suitable for many different people. Typically I would start my day by checking in to see how the store did financially the prior day. What losses and gains we had and what opportunities I had on my current day to improve and grow. I would also check on my team to check their progress and opportunities and talk about it with them when they came in. I had a great team who consistently met their goals and Management communicated and showed support as well. I maintained good communication with my GM and worked closely to set and achieve goals both individually and as a team. I regularly hit over 110 percent in revenue so my goals were alway fairly high.  "
good,"Best Buy has the potential to be an amazing place to work. Unfortunately many locations have associates that are not held to the same standards as everyone else and this leave everyone else to do their work. Promises will also be made with no real intention of fulfilling them, regardless of performance. Not being commissioned based is a nice benefit. It allows for a team based environment. This is my personal favorite part of Best Buy. There are certain associates that will make working there very enjoyable and entertaining. Having clients come in and ask specifically for you and will to wait any length of time to work with you always makes the job feel worth it. If you want a good starting job to get your feet wet and learn some long term useful skills then I would recommend this company."
good,"Working at Best Buy is a decent retail job.  The company typically compensates and rewards its employees well and the benefits are decent.  The quality of your work experience is largely dependent on which store/department you work in and the quality of the leadership there.  The majority of the workforce and some of the leadership tend to be very young of course, so there are things that you have to deal with that go along with that.  Overall it is a good company to work for and one that is making the necessary changes to survive and compete.  Advancement tends to be rapid to start and diminishes greatly once you hit the management level as your only real choice is to run a store.  It is difficult to switch fields (from the retail side to the logistics side for example)."
good,This was my first job so it was great at the time but as time went on management was changing and the workplace was too. I learned to be a fast paced worker and a fast learner.
good,"Constant changes in employees, politcies, and they push you to hit numbers daily. They say no commission just hourly pay but then harassed you if you don't make the numbers for monthly bonus."
good,"I'm forever grateful for Best Buy, I definitely learned a lot about not only the latest and greatest technological devices, but myself too. My coworkers were good, but the most enjoyable part of my job had to be the customers. All in all Best Buy is a job I will always remember."
good,Needed a job that was willing to work with my availability and this was the perfect one. At times it was very stressful but overall I enjoyed working there.
good,Great place to work as a student. Managers are fair but play favorites when it comes to advancement. Alot of talking behind your back will occur. While working there I was never approached directly by the GM eventhough he worked 10 hour days at least 4 days a week. Everything was told to my immdiate supervisor and then told to me.
good,"making sure customers have the best experience when shopping in store."
good,no training done at all. poor management and they expect you to know all services and tech information immediately. Good atmosphere though but very competitive and sales are tracked.
good,"They will work very hard to fit your shifts around your school work. The managers usually are pretty good and try at their jobs, unfortunately there just isn't much opportunity at the company. They are being hammered by Amazon and online shopping, and it shows in their methods, policies and how they treat the people that actually matter."
good,Management was sometimes cruel and overbearing. Expected a lot of associates. Compensation was higher than expected. Bi-weekly paycheck.
good,Coworkers are great and easy to get along with.  Typical day involves selling computers and tablet to customers.  There really isn't a hard part to my job and the most enjoyable is seeing the customers leave with what they wanted.
good,My day at BestBuy consist a many things that includes the monitoring of daily operations in the store and also handling various issues from our consumers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Supervisors and Managers are always changing, either getting fired or abruptly quitting. Some not hesitating to simply walk out."
good,"A typical day involved the managers harassing me about my sales numbers and selling products to guests. My coworkers are all just like me, college students trying to make their way through college with a part time job. All in all, it was an okay experience and would be better if managers weren't so sarcastic and rude."
good,Coworkers are friendly. The atmosphere is of that of a big family. Fun place to work. Being interested in tech is a big help.
good,"Our duties require: "
good,"this is an okay job, pays well but long stressful hours especially during the holidays. Don't really like working with your schedule if you are a student"
good,"questionable sales ethics."
good,"Even though dealing with customers were never easy, the management was very excellent at dealing with unexpected problems that would arise. The hours were not enough but when i was there, I've learned much from my bosses to be patient under pressure and to become a problem solver."
good,"- Good place to work"
good,Good place for high school students to gain experience in customer service. Not designed for college graduate as pay is minimal and opportunities for advancement are few and far in between.
good,"Best Buy is a fun retail store but due to the burgeoning online avenues to get the same products cheaper than in a brick and mortar, they definitely have challenges ahead of them."
good,"Great place to work and learn about the retail world. But if you want a work/life balance in a management role, good luck."
good,The coworkers were the best part of the job. The management was questionable. The job culture was not evenly rewarded or respected. Concentrated on sales not people.
good,"Great environment and occasionally fantastic mentors. This is a great job for young people looking to learn the meaning of work ethics, how to show up on time be dressed to face public and be ready to answer hard questions that you may not know the answer too."
good,"A typical day at work is usually simple and smooth, unless it is during the holiday season. Management is fun, but they are young. I noticed that a lot of them have made rookie like mistakes. The hardest part of the job was probably unloading trucks and down-stocking. 9.50 an hour doesn't seem bad, but on the down-stocking days, that seems like nothing. The constant lifting of heavy items was not fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom-like feel that the store had."
good,"Thus far I have enjoyed my time at Best Buy.  The amount of PTO they offer is far and away higher than almost any other major corporation you'll find in the twin cities.  Very much a ""be yourself"" culture without oppressive dress codes, and the ability to work a schedule that's best for you.   I have also enjoyed a high level of flexibility with working from home when the weather is exceptionally bad, or when I'm sick."
good,"didnt really take in to much of this place, real tight about what went on in there. not to much laid back time always was non -stop."
good,"I learned a lot from the company. Management didn't care about the staff. I thought working for Best Buy was awesome at first, but throughout the years, the job became a job and no more fun. We had structure when I first started, but after awhile, I felt like no one cared about building their employees. The point to be with a company is to move up."
good,"Very good management but was just a seasonal job and if the had a permanent warehouse in Pickering,ON. i would have would pursued a career there further."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"i would greet all customers that came in to our store"
good,Best Buy can be a great company to work for and can lead to advancement in your career. Working for Best Buy is a great starting job to place you with knowledge on how to provide excellent customer service and teach you techniques on Selling and product support. Depending on your leadership you can also learn a great deal about personal development and how to further reach goals in your life in and outside the company.
good,"A day at Best Buy was coming into work reviewing numbers related to your department, fixing gaps in productivity, and recognizing achievements.  Daily coordination with other supervisors and management to course correct opportunities and work with employees to coach and train through Best Buy practices.  Also work with employees to disseminate corporate and store objectives so all employees are on the same page."
good,Great atmosphere. Unfortunately the management could be better. Your co-workers will make or break your experience working for Best Buy. A typical day consist of greeting and helping customers find what they need. Completing complex sales and getting a pat on the back. Best Buy does not offer commission either.
good,"The work place is fun the coworkers are great to be around, but the management staff isn't the greatest, they don't really take time to get to know their employees, they just want to hit budget. When you are struggling they don't offer to help they criticize your work ethic. Even with the management staff being poor its still fun to work there with people you like and have fun working with, seeing the new technology coming out for people is also fun because at best buy we  get the opportunity to teach that to our customers"
good,"Good environment, can be fun if you get decent coworkers, though it's becoming rough to be management."
good,"The job was not difficult but when a sales associate performs better than 99% of the company according to its own sales statistics, they should be provided opportunities for growth and monetary compensation.  Good luck getting either."
good,"Best Buy does not offer training to employees. Even if you are learning a new department, you'll be expected to learn and grow on your own. There is also never an HR saavy person working within a Best Buy store that has been educated on proper HR practices. There is an HR hotline that any employee is able to contact anonymously, but not having someone there on a consistent basis effects the way employees are treated. There is a lot of favoritism, personal vendettas, and gossip on part of management."
good,"Working at Best Buy was fun at times, but if you are older it can be a S.O.B.! I think it was that the company is trying to balance competing businesses with overhead from employee payroll. Best Buy seems to think that workers do not need to make a living. What I mean by that is, the company used to pay commission and now they do not. I had fun, seeing as I am an outgoing person. Management had their work cut out for them; one of the hardest thing in managing a business is employee morale. I had some good co-workers and some bad. It was kinda like high school; this section will hang with their own section. I learned a whole new way of doing the this type of job. I came from another job after twenty years of employment."
good,"Great place to work with training as needed, Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Plenty of room for growth and advancement. I would  would recommend other to work for this employer"
good,It is a great place too work I have learned tons about cellular sales and the amazing people who keep such a great company like best buy on top.
good,"Promoted store offers on cellular phones while maintaining a highly friendly environment and attitude."
good,I worked here while completing some college courses. Its retail and has alot of other teens working there so it got dramatic quickly. Its a nice business to work for. I just had to quit due to needing more time at school.
good,A work environment that stretches ones thinking capacity but has inconsistent hours which makes for a somewhat difficult work life balance
good,"I love working with customers and meeting new people. I have a way of ""connecting"" with the customer. I like most of my co-workers. Management is lacking on most instances. I would prefer a job where I can sit. On my feet too much at Best Buy."
good,Best Buy was ok I think they can train better and help their associates a lot better
good,Basic retail job.  Money is not great but if you like people and electronics it may be a good place for you.  Seems to be more politically driven then most places.
good,"Was promised a steady job with security, started that way until consistent hour cuts and then laid off without cause along with 70% of the other employees so that they could hire cheaper new employees."
good,I am limited to the front of the store only. Occasionally I move from the front to go into the Loss Prevention office but it is rare. I learned a lot about the loss prevention field.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is what you would expect in a retail setting, but times 2. A lot is expected from you. You definitely earn your wage day in and day out. If you enjoy spending weekends and or holidays with your family, this definitely is not the job for you. Great job with great benefits for a single individual who is motivated and not afraid to put in work."
good,fun but a lot of pressure management needs improvement need to pay more for specialty departments
good,"We would receive and account for inventory every morning."
good,"the job is pretty fun and it was only that way because of who i worked with. Management was very poor in my opinion in the specific store i worked in. hardest part was lifting heavy merchandise, most enjoyable part was the cool electronics we messed with during work"
good,"Best Buy has definitely changed a lot since I started back in 2010. The overall employee experience has definitely deteriorated, and the management team has almost gave up on the employee and is only worried about numbers. "
good,"Learned to handle cash, help customers, process credit card applications, and process returns of merchandise."
good,"I've heard mixed reviews about the company; my store in particular wasn't the best. We rarely hit budget for the store goals, the management wasn't the best, and many of my coworkers were lethargic and unwilling to work. I personally made effort to contact customers, clean the department, and hit sales goals, so I did. I worked hard and was not compensated fairly, underappreciated, and overworked. I cross trained into multiple departments (before the reorganization and the store model changed to ""One Best Buy"") and I was never given a thank-you by any of my management; I was only fussed at for doing things wrong when I had no other option but to do it the way I did."
good,"physical demanding job"
good,"It is nice to work in a place where you can learn a lot of new technology. It is hard to move up with the company, management does not seem to want to promote people who work hard, but rather people who do not work hard and suck up to the managers. The compensation for those who work hard is usually less than those who do not, and it is difficult to get better compensation."
good,This was just a paycheck and literally a foot in the door of troubleshooting and IT.
good,The management at best buy was not good at  all because they had us doing task that were not in our job codes. my coworkers were really good people.
good,Best buy is a decent place to work at. working for the season wasn't bad but it can be hectic for people trying to get more hours
good,"People were friendly, always busy so it made the day go by faster, management was professional, the hardest part of the job was the customer complaints & the most fun part was the time that I had with the people that I worked with..."
good,"As a beginning IT job, one if I were to get straight out of high school or college then it would be a very worthwhile job. You get to learn how to gain a temperance with clients, gain speed and efficiency in break/fix, and learn how to simplify technobabble which in this day and age are vital skills for any budding IT guy to learn."
good,Great place to work if you have a specialized degree. Learned to work with professional people. Great management.
good,The work itself was good. I would show up in the morning and do sign changes and make sure the store was stocked. I would prepare orders for store pick up and shipping to home. I would prepare anything to go out on the shuttle and unload and load it when it arrived.
good,"I work best buy PT along side of my full time supervisor job at Home depot. Working for two retailers is challenging but fun. Best buy has a good culture, and the company has some awesome standards, making associates feel appreciated. their is career advancement, but the company has recently made some changes a lot of managers are saying the is less room to grow. I don't agree with some of management productivity. Best buy pushes customer service without realizing the importance of in-stock."
good,Hard to move up. Could be a fun workplace starter job for college students.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,There was little opportunity for advancement and the positions that did open up for advancement were not given to the most qualified applicant. There is a pronounced culture of favoritism present. The amount and complexity of the issues I was forced to solve merited a significant increase in pay that was never received.
good,"Best Buy did not have the best of environments. I was assigned to the Personal Computer/Home Office department. I had a basic knowledge about computers, but I didn't receive the necessary training required to exceed at the job. They were not very flexible with my school schedule and the manager did not make a conscious effort to see how the employee was doing."
good,i liked the job until the management changed and the goals became harder to reach. would not reccmned. depends on which branch you work in
good,"I worked in Operations and Multi-Channel Sales at Best Buy for 9+ years.  I liked the people that I worked with, but our GM was a waste of space.  In my time there, my salary only increased by a total of $6 per hour.  Benefits are decent, especially 401(k).  Not sure they know how to run a company now though, too many overall changes."
good,"I have met some life long friends through this job and absolutely love going to work. However, sometimes it is very difficult to manage my personal life with work and the management I currently work under."
good,There is not much to say about this place. It is a corporate environment and employees are treated like a number. The whole experience of working at Best buy is what you make of it.
good,"Lots to do and learn. Exciting at times. Some managers are really dynamic, others are not so good at being reasonable and relatable. Engaging with people, providing positive experiences was fun. Hardest part of the job was the long hours having to lock up the store almost every night."
good,Its pretty easy. They care a lot about you getting credit apps and attaching Geek Squad Protection. I work with some really cool people which makes it great. Doesn't really seem to be much room to advance at the moment but hopefully there will be in the future. There are like 5 managers/supervisors/leads and most are cool except 1 guy who micromanages.
good,"-counted down drawers"
good,Best Buy has a changing corporate culture becoming less and less concerned about its employees and customers. The company has taken many steps to shrink the organization structure and in doing so has become out of touch with the employees that make the company run. Very poor job security as layoffs happen often in management.
good,"My typical day at work consists of giving customers the best experience while they're at our store. My specialty is tablets so whenever a customer needs assistance in that area they contact me. By asking them basic questions I assure that my customer gets the technology they need along with other accessories that could be useful to them. To close my sale, I make sure I've provided the best experience by using our unique technique called WOW in which assures that we've thoroughly assisted them and related to the customer in every possible way. Best Buy brought me great experiences in which I learned a lot about today's modern technology. I was able to expand customer service skills as well as teamwork skills. One of the hardest parts has been dealing with ""traffic"" days in which I had to assist three customer at the same time. Since I am one of the only Spanish speaking employees at my department it could be hard dealing with a number of customers at once. However, it has taught me to deal with tough situations, deal with challenging customers and multitasking at a high speed. Thankfully I have great co workers in which i get along with and are able to help me when they can. The most enjoyable part is interacting with my customers and providing them with a great experience."
good,"Everyday is enjoyable.  A lot of teamwork comes into play and the staff is, for the most part, outstanding. I've worked at several different jobs in several in different fields and and Best Buy tends to send me home with a happy face! Management is descent, a lot of inexperienced managers were hired which becomes an issue but the co-workers and staff overall is great.  The hardest part of the job would be trying to fix product and answer product questions when technology goes wrong.  It's not easy being a human in competition with a robot!!! However, the most enjoyable part about the job is there's a different challenge every day!"
good,"I have had a wonderful experience with Best Buy.  However, advancement opportunities seem to be shrinking by the moment."
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work.  The Employees are hard working and enjoyable to work with.
good,"Assemble lighting displays"
good,Best Buy is a decent place to work while going to school.  Due to their recent restructuring it no longer pays as high. Stake holders no longer believe in profit sharing. If you need work and being underpaid to work in an environment which is friendly and clean is ok than I'd recommend them.
good,Just cashiering and cleaning up the cashier area. Same thing everyday.
good,Learned a lot about the electronics that were sold at Best Buy along with sales skills.
good,"Overall fun to work with technology and interact with many customers. Having said that, getting flat pay without commission, leaves the worker bearing all the cost and little benefit. Not a high growth opportunity because you get pidgin holed into sales, with management and supervisor opportunities, which rarely open up and often require working there for years. This is fine except for the fact that you can easily do the same job elsewhere and get paid more....."
good,Over the past several years the company has changed so drastically to stay competitive which I agree with.  The company is sparing no expense though to cut cost and is causing a negative employee experience.  Most days I enjoy assisting the customers and finding a great solution for them.  Management needs to work on being more engaged at times and truly listen to their employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Coworkers are wonderful, good benefits, fair pay. Flexible schedules and generous employee discount."
good,"The management is clueless, the customers believe they know better, the Sunday morning meetings are wretched - but even through  that, it is still a fun place to work.  Spending your life entrenched in fun unnecessary technology just leads to feeling the glamorous side of things.  The coworkers are nice, everyone is responsible for themselves, and the hours are exactly what they are.  Corporate doesn't allow hourly employees to go over 40 hours a week, and there is absolutely no baggage to take home with you at the end of the day."
good,"I work at the Best Buy in Rockford, IL in the geek squad department where I provide tech support and customer service."
good,Love the ability to play with the newest technology on the market
good,"A typical day at Best Buy usually involves me managing the other associates, and analyzing numbers to make our business better. Also a big part of the job is selling and maximizing every sale. My co workers are great they do a very good job of staying focused and being productive with every transaction. I would say that the hardest part of my job is making sure all the product is in the right places and maintaining the look of the department. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I see a satisfied customer leave the store with everything they needed and all of there questions answered, that is when you know you have done your job well."
good,Good place to work if you have no personal life. The people were nice.
good,"Working with partner store to sell the labor you need to get jobs in the field. Fixing issues from store, dot.com sales, phone sales. Store employees have lack of selling and closing skills. (not the right product or sold out of ones pocket). The hours of 8-4 was good, until the change of days off went from two consecutive days to splits all the time."
good,"A typical day at work for me was making sales and building rapports with customers to close the sale, and making sure I meet my sales goals . I have learned how to become a fighter and strive to be the best at what I do this job has taught me how to become a good team player but also how to become a great salesman. I've learned how to advance my skills as a great customer service rep and sales associate. The management for me was not the greatest because during the time I was there the store lost the GM so many changes started to occur quickly. The store is still trying to replace the GM today and the store hasn't gotten any better. I love my co-workers I still keep in touch with them today because they were great people and friends that I keep in touch with today. Although at times it became competitive with some of them on making sales but It helped me to become a better salesman all the way around. The hardest part of the job I would say is trying not to overwork myself because everyday at this job I made sure I met my goal as a salesman all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was just working with a great team of employees who where kind of close to me like family."
good,Best Buy is fun but does not meet the requirements of my cost of living
good,"Would like to move on, job advancement takes years here, pay is low."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work and people there are friendly. The hardest part of the job would be some of the customers though they are very rude. Management is sometimes alright but sometimes not the typical Management role model that a company needs.
good,"Setups, troubleshooting, hardware installations. Refurbishing computers."
good,"It was a fun work environment and always something to do. However, they would not hire from with-in for other positions of the store, they would hire new employees even if another employee currently working there has had prior experience."
good,"Best Buy is consistently changing. Now, that isn't always a bad thing, but the unfortunate part is the management not allowing most associates to grow, and it's changing for the worse. There's a constant turn-around, which leads to job insecurity. Associates are treated like they make commission, having to meet daily goals, and if they don't they get disconnected. The hardest part of the job would be the miscommunication between all of the managers, being told to do 3 things in a single day hurts work-flow, and it is seen everyday. Compensation isn't what it seems, I know making $9-$10.50/hr sounds spectacular, but when you make that, and an annual $0.15 raise, it isn't much to live off of."
good,"I had a interesting experience working here.  I'll be honest, it can be really good or you can get stuck with the usual politics here.  Some of the Supervisors and Managers are really cool."
good,"Very social job, I loved interacting with the customers and learning about the latest in technology and trends"
good,A typical day at work would be counting cash drawers. Meet and greet with customers. Encourage customers to apply for best buy credit cards and to purchase geek squad protection plans if its offered with their purchase.I learned that a lot of people work and get along in different ways. Everybody is different. The management overall was okay. The hardest part of the job would be encouraging customers to purchase geek squad protection. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet new people and interact with the different customers that came in to buy.
good,overall good experience. Not enough room to grow within the company.
good,selling everything and installing products. Have a lot of cool employees.
good,Job is better than nothing but prepare to deal with managers and teammates that don't know much about what they are talking about. Some managers may have an IQ of less than 12. Also staying 2-3 hours after shifts to do other peoples work
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Advancement is non existent, most managers are lazy and don't care as much as they should, Ideas that could help the store are never considered unless it comes from one of them. Pay sucks, for having to deal with all the self entitled people day in and day out, for Asset Protection there is no self fulfillment. Best part is people watching worst part is, hardly any lunches even if you work a 7 hour shift and you can forget about breaks I have never had even one break. Basically one guy to guard the whole store is just silly and stupid."
good,"I recently returned to Best Buy as a second part time job for the holidays. As you would expect much has changed since the last time I worked there in 2003. But much remained as with any cooperation where profits were the main focus. Now intensive training is part of the hiring process unlike in 2003 which was probably the best change. You learn quite a bit as far as with sales, marketing, product information and potential fraud cases. Management was a bit annoying repeating the same things over and over again about theft prevention which I can understand but it tends to be a pain. The hardest part about working at Best Buy was dealing with the customers to a degree. Part of our training as sales reps is to ""convince"" the customer to why I need to buy this product, or when a customer comes in trying to ""work the system"" and start to disrupt the flow of business just to save $5. Having to run back and forth between the departments and the warehouse, and not having enough of the equipment needed to perform certain tasks. The most enjoyable part of working with Best Buy was interacting with most of the customers, being able to provide great service to them and seeing the look of satisfaction on their faces let me know I did a good job."
good,"decent pay, good hours, bad management, and bad leadership."
good,"You have to have a pretty face to work for this company. I worked as a seasonal for 2 months and I didn't like what I saw. Many employees that I saw on the clock rarely did anything. As a new hire, sure throw me in the deep end and hope that I make it out alive. I made enemies because I didn't agree with other employees.. It was High School all over again."
good,"The only complaints I have are wages are not fair per the constant change of work load. I have a lot of takeaways from this job on how to and how not to run a business. I mostly enjoy my co-workers, they make the time go by faster. I don't find any difficulties preforming the task assigned but the constant changes without any forewarning is annoying."
good,"Environment pushes for you to sell, sell, sell.  Great place for a first time job,."
good,My day started by taking any sick calls for the day and logging them as well as informing the supervisors of their employees that called in. I would then review labor budgets to make sure they were on pace for the week and month. This was followed up by a meeting with supervisors to inform them of what to expect from the parts department for the day. Through out the day I would communicate with suppliers to ensure acceptable quantities on hand. Management in general had a sexist view looking for eye candy rather than the best worker. Managers can be hard to communicate with at times as they are focused on their own goals and expectations. Most of my struggles came from one manager wanting increased inventory immediately and not listening to the process that needed to be followed. My manager understood what I was trying to accomplish; however he even would get lost in the overall picture of what we were trying to accomplish. That had to be one of the hardest parts of the job. Most enjoyable was the employees that worked for me. They made my job easier by working hard.
good,This job is a full customer service job. One can become very knowledgable because there are different departments that a person can be bounced into.
good,Best buy is a sales job; no time for anything. The management doesn't get involved nor do they back the employees. The most difficult idea to grasp was the company wanted you to learn but gave the employee no time to learn. Also management would not promote a hard working individual who gave their all.
good,"Best Buy in Pearland, Tx was not what I expected.  I love giving great customer service, but not under their management"
good,"Working at Best Buy was a pleasure. However, the pay is not sufficient enough for a family. The typical day consisted of connecting with customers, supporting management, leading and developing coworkers, and gaining knowledge through experience. Management can be very helpful, and often provide advice to improve performance. Coworkers are productive and also friendly, many of which are going to be life long friends."
good,"The atmosphere was just like any other entry level retail position, but with the added bonus of more pay and a little bit better experience. I see it as good step into the IT field when first starting out."
good,"Great environment and used to be a great place to work at. A lot of changes happened and the interest in employees became non existing. More than 25% of the employees immediately started seeking other jobs. It became a company that no longer differentiated itself from others."
good,"I rung up customers at the cash register for the majority of the time. I learned to make connections with people I had never met and even sold insurance policies on more expensive items (game consoles, speakers, computers). I assessed the needs of customers and offered them protections for their products based on their individual needs. It was important to make people feel comfortable so that they would take advice to protect their purchases."
good,"Good company to work for plenty of room for advancement. Down fall is too many chains of command to get anything productive done. You can advance up to a point, then becomes more ""politics"". What I mean by that is, you have to know someone or be a good talker with tenure. Work skills and productivity can only get you so far. "
good,"Best Buy is a fast paced CE giant. They have a clean competitive environment to work in. The company has slowly turned into a less collaborative work environment. Most of the tenure has either left or been let go. "
good,"Harsh environment, no commission or bonuses leaves employees feeling unnoticed and unworthy."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable, fast-paced and busy. Great people to work with."
good,"they dont pay well, they promise you the sky and turn around and tell you that theres not room for you anymore, managment plays favorites a lot, you work inconsistant hours, not a terrible place to start but only 9 dollars an hour is tough. they do have a great employee discount."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You sell a variety of electronics every day. Co-workers are the best part about the job. The hardest part of the job is learning new products as they come in because training is almost non-existent.
good,"My work day is to go to two clients home in the time frame of 8-12 in the morning to seek their expectations of what type of home entertainment system they would like. The remainder of my day is to build a proposal with the products and services of what me and the client discussed. "
good,"It is difficult to advance through Best Buy, and the policies are ridged. However, it is friendly environment and lots of training is provided. "
good,I was a seasonal employee at best buy. I worked in the video games section and that was fun. It got worse as time went on because they expected a lot more out of you then really was even possible. The management was not very well set up. My co-workers were all pretty cool people. The hardest part of the job was trying to please all of the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers. There was never enough people working either.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy would be to set up the store for the business day and keep store organized, stocked, and cleaned on a regular basis. What I learned from Best Buy was that numbers were more important than customer service. Management was inconsistent and typically unprofessional in their development of employees. Co-workers were fun, yet young and inexperienced when it came to satisfying the client/customer. Highly unprofessional by talking down to customers or talking back in an aggressive type manner. This was not by all must by most. Hardest part about the job was the lack of professionalism and direction by management, as well as, the lack of professionalism by my co-workers. Best part about the job was the technology we were allowed to you everyday as well as the fun events they were planned as an attempt to team building. "
good,It was a great place to meet and work with friends but sometimes they expect the world from you.
good,"I was in high-school and my first year of college while doing this. I did  the same thing every day which I wasn't a fan of, and I found selling wasn't my strong point. However, speaking to a multitude of people on a daily basis was my favorite part. I have a great personality so this was fantastic."
good,Had an amazing boss. Also managers will always look after there guys.
good,"I am currently stuck working as a delivery driver and have been for the last couple of years. I am stuck with no room for advancement in the company as there is no job title above me, unless I take a $4 to $5 pay cut to work in sales for the store and try to move up from there, which would take me 3-5 years at the earliest. My pay isn't very fair for the amount of hard work that I do."
good,More specialized help offered by employees but other than that your average retail environment. 
good,Good place to work very flexible job. Great for college kids.
good,Coach and train employees and ensure no customer goes unserved.
good,"Working for BestBuy, I was able to learn more about the technical/computer field. Customer interaction in such a field is entirely different, as far as information and know-how, than other retailers. Thus, it was highly important for us, all employees and managers, to know what it was we were talking about when in a sale or customer conversation."
good,"I thought that Best Buy did not advance people. They never got the raises they were suppose to. They never told people how good they were for the company. All they cared about was numbers. The thing I learned about Best Buy was to work with over 150 workers a day. I liked my coworkers very much. The hardest thing about the job was I was always in the top third in the district, and they could of cared less."
good,good company for college students. was able to correlate material i was learning in school in a real life atmosphere.
good,"My coworkers were the best part of going to my job everyday. A few take aways from this particlar job is the continuous coaching by the managers and supervisors, they made sure that each person in every department was outstanding at what they did. The continuos coaching had its positives and negatives, an example of a negative was the constant pressure of maintaing certain goals and expectations each work day."
good,It's an ok place to work. I can't say I want to make a career out of it but it's fine for paying the rent for now.
good,No real problems about this Company except for the rate of Advancement and trying to get hired.
good,"I hired into GSC, part of the Services protion of Best Buy, when it first started in 2006. Since then I have had one promotion. I have consistanly exceeded expectations and have consistantly gotten annual raises, but there are way too few jobs to advance into in the service field. There's no compensation for certifications, or furthering your training/education of the product."
good,"Depending on the day or a certain holiday, it can get real busy in Best Buy. The management in the store I work for is great, there are a few issues with how things are at Best Buy, but there will always be issues with any job you work for."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very fun and stressful at times, but the Sales goals are exciting and achievable."
good,"My job at Best Buy Mobile is a good job other than the management and the utilization of my skills. I enjoy my team and strive to develop them on a daily basis. A typical day consists of selling, inventory management, and people management to be the best we can be. I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to obtain some of the outlandish goals that are set forth as well as some of the wild people we see on a daily basis and dealing with an overbearing district manager. The most enjoyable part is my team and the effort and energy they bring everyday."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to be around, always getting to see and play with new technology."
good,Best buy was ok when I was there but the fact that working on the weekends is a must and its long hours would really mess up your plans if you have a family
good,"crazy work ennviroment, management is unstable and they dont pay that well however there is awesome discounts on products!"
good,"Nice company good benefits for part time employees. Great atmosphere good store manager, great incentives lots of money to be made."
good,This was enjoyable place to work. I had a lot of Friends at work so we always tried to have fun while being the Best.
good,"i gained a lot of experience from my job at best buy, mostly returns and selling to the customer, the management was very unkind hardest part was having customers walk away unhappy know ing there was nothing i could do i enjoyed seeing customer happy and satisfied"
good,"""don't ever let someone leave here with just a TV, they had better be leaving with a TV, HDMI cables, A sound system, Wall Mount, and a Warranty"""
good,Pros
good,"Very number driven. Ideally the customer got what they wanted, but the numbers drove a lot of things. You learn a lot about whichever department you get hired into. The training is very good and as efficient as you make it. Lots of information accessible from home. Not very much room to grow within the company though. The growth structure isn't very well established. There isn't really a lot of room to grow from an hourly employee to a supervisory or managerial position. The scheduling is flexible at least though."
good,"In the time I was there (2 years), I tried to leave computer sales and get into the computer service (currently called the Geek Squad) department. I have had over 25 years as a computer tech and had got the PC techs out of a couple of jams on my own time (I couldn't get out of my sales duties to help them)."
good,"A typical day at work consist of off loading 53' trailers. lumping stores according to specific store numbers. I've learned how to use rf scanners as well as warehouse equipment such as pallet jacks(electric and manual) as well as other equipment. experiience with co-workers has been pleasent, i am always listening to be able to learn as much as possible. I dont feel anything is hard about this type of work. its real rewarding physically as well as mentally. i enjoy the fast paced safety oriented work that goes along with warehouse work."
good,"Management can use some work. They show favoritism towards certain employees. Some days are under staffed and you have to do other people's jobs. Some employees are always willing to help, but others are lazy, and get away with laziness."
good,"Best Buy is a great starter job, meaning for high school/college students. Certain positions are career type jobs such as delivery and geek squad. Management is hard to get into because of the age of current managers, therefore advancements are minimal."
good,"A fun place to be, learned a lot about transactions and customer solutions. Management changed a lot but we always grew used to it. Co-workers were extremely easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is language barriers and the pressure put onto associates when things go wrong"
good,Pay not that much unless your young. This is not a company you can grow with if your older unless your young and you want to be a store manager.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"cashier, not much to do, i bundled items, and sold protections. i hate that the hours are competitive based on how much you can sell, don't get me wrong I was a great seller but it's still not fair."
good,"I worked as a AP and it is not a fun job, I would work either open to afternoon or afternoon to close. You are required to do way to many things that hinder your job as a loss prevention person. They expect you to greet customers, check returns, check receipts, call for carry outs, watch the security monitors, and much more. You are so busy doing other things you have no time to try and catch shoplifters."
good,Not a good job for career advancement. I learned a lot of selling and communications skills here but after 3 years I am needing a change. Communication is all over the place. You make great friends here but there is not much teamwork.
good,Good co-workers and habits.
good,"flexible hours, cool new technology, meet a lot of people, could be fun at times,"
good,I learned how to manage my time i loved all of my coworkers they made the day go by quick
good,When I was hired in for delivery driver I had to go to Okemos for a week to train with their crew. They didn't believe in training but more in whining and saying they're the best at delivery. I learned more when I got back to my store and was trained by my co-worker. Once on the job be prepared for heavy lifting especially fridges and stoves. Customers appreciated us. Only the physically fit do this job.
good,"A typical work day at Best Buy consisted of working in the mobile phone department assisting customers with upgrades, hardware issues and general questions. I learned a lot about the phone and service industry along with working with customers and really listening to them and finding the best fit product for them. My managers were rather distanced from the employees. There was minimal interaction and concern from the managers. My co-workers were for the most part great. They were friendly and welcoming and were helpful whenever I had a question. The hardest part of my job was learning the activation system. At times, it was very confusing. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. They were just very pleasant to work with."
good,"On a regular work day it was very busy, considering it was one of the few electronic stores remaining."
good,"Company is in restructuring in order to stay in business. Has eliminated certain jobs and expanded others. May be a good opportunity for part time employment, but not really an option for full-time."
good,"Requires a lot of skills pertaining to multitasking with customers in front of you, machines being worked on, and phone calls coming in throughout the day. Must be detail oriented and have strong customer service skills, being able to speak professional and technical during client communication. Most down time consists of ""agents"" being utilized in other departments as help is needed, which broadens the scope of work in which one is expected to perform."
good,"As far as the retail world goes, Best Buy is probably as good as it gets for employment. The products we work with are fun and there are rewards for hard work."
good,A typical day at work is fun because everyday there a new problem to solve. I learn alot at this job I fill like I can tear down bestbuy and rebuild it from nothing. My co-worker are hardwork people that are very wise in retail. I enjoy my work but its tiring at times.
good,i was a little prototyped. but other than that it was ok. they have a hard working team that keeps the store in good condition. Pressure rises when sales are not up.
good,Each day is different because you get to work with new customers and find new solutions daily. I learned how to get creative in finding answers. Management is supportive but overwhelmed with daily tasks. Co-workers are either great or lazy. The hardest part of the job was not being on commission. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding ways to make customer's lives easier through technology.
good,Was able to do what I do best every day ensure that customers that came in the store left happy and got exceptional customer service. I worked for Best Buy for almost 11 years. The last 6 years working in a leadership capacity of some form. I loved being able to coach and train employees especially around how to provide a world class experience for our customers. I worked with and had amazing relationships with my peers and had many mentors along the way. The best part of the job was making a difference whether it be for the customer and their experience or one of my employees. I truly enjoyed seeking out talent and developing my employees. There is nothing better than watching a person grow with the company and as an individual. The most challenging but also one of my favorite parts of the job were during the holidays. We were extremely busy working long hard hours but in the end it was worth it. I would plan for months everything form inventory to staffing and training. there was nothing more satisfying to me than executing a plan watching it all come together and it be a success. Overall my time with Best Buy was amazing I learned so many skills that I will be able to take with me anywhere I go to be successful.
good,It was fun working here. Don't really have any complaints. Long as you are a knowledgable person in the products you're selling.
good,Not a lot of growth opportunity and pay was not equal to job duties.
good,Management is just messed up in this company especially at the corporate level.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,My typical day at work was checking receipts coming in and going out of the building. I maintained visual and camera surveillance on individuals in the store to keep profit loss down. My co-workers were helpful in doing there part in maintaining profit loss. The management team were accessible when an alleged theft was in progress.
good,"very busy work environment and fast paced. learned a lot about dealing with vendors, and had some of the best co-workers ever."
good,It's a good place to work at if you like committing to your job as a sales person. The environment isnt so bad depending on what department you work at.
good,"Best Buy is a fast pace electronic store, technology is always changing. It was great working here, I just feel as though I was not compensated fairly for the work I completed on a daily basis."
good,"In my 5 years with Best Buy I have acquired a skill set that will help me in any endeavor I partake in moving forward in life. This is the only good thing that I can say about the company that I put 5 years of loving work into today however. The company has been backsliding for the last year and a half, and this is due in large part I feel to a sense of hopelessness in the work environment. They have been scaling back benefits almost quarterly it seems, and the opportunity for advancements have all but disappeared. I sincerely hope that they are able to turn this trend around, and return to the company that I loved working for."
good,"I used to enjoy working for Best Buy. Now, it is just not the same. It used to be a fun and exciting place to work but recent directions from corporate are killing employee morale."
good,"If your looking to gain some customer service and sales experience this company will definitely help you. However, often times they undervalue their employees with low pay and low hours especially part time workers. Full time workers will enjoy the many benefits offered and are in most cases guaranteed 40 hrs,"
good,"It is retail so that's that, but if you can get past the annoying customers and good for nothing management, you can survive."
good,The company has it's high and low points but these days things seem to be headed south. The retailer is failing to keep up with the competition and will be on the way out in the 5-7 years.
good,"Low pay even after years of working there, not willing to advance people"
good,"Best Buy over the years has shown in many ways that they have complete disregard for their employees. Your just another number to them. If you going to be a cashier,service desk,basic sales position, or even a geek squad member its not bad. Once you get into any type of supervisor role or above your job security goes right out the window. They have a reputation of creating new positions..promoting people to them and then the position disappears and you along with it. I have seen them take people who have been with the company for many many years and do a great job in the leadership roles just get cast to the side because of restructuring. Seriously this would happen like 3x a year. It was terrible"
good,"best buy es una buena empresa para trabajar pero cuando das ideas para mejorar, no son escuchadas, y aveces la misma administracion no acepta propuestas para que la empresa mejore"
good,"If you love technology and selling or even welling to learn how to , this is a great company to work for. Many different department to work in , great company"
good,"Got to meet some cool people, the job itself was not too difficult (Shipping). Some rules I did  not understand, as why you can not bring in any electronic devices into the warehouse, or when i was there you can not turn on the radio. Some rules seem too restrictive but other than that everything was ok."
good,"It's a good first job, depending on if your location can actually sustain itself and your managers can actually do things I guess?  Benefits and employee discount are good tho"
good,the managers there are pretty cool for the most part. its not too complicated learning how to use the RF scanners. the pallet jacks and lifts were a bit tricky but i got the hang of it pretty quick.
good,While the people were kind the overall work was OK at best really nothing special. There seemed to be very little growth company wise and if you did it was being friends with people not hard work.
good,"If you're lucky enough to land a Vendor Position with Best Buy, You'll be in better hands than the regular employee's. Your responsibilities are to focus on your brand. As well as train other associates on what's new with your brand. You'll still have to make Best Buy happy though, and that's where the trouble comes in and the constant push and pull between your brand and best buy happens."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day at work involved showing up in the early morning and prepping the store for opening. As a part timer generally your day involves day-to-day opening duties such as updating pricing, spot-cleaning and downstocking (identifying spots in the store than can be filled with product and filling them). Some days you assist the full-timer(s) in redoing sections of the store."
good,Enrichissi c’était pas mal . L’atmosphère de travail était bonne
good,Like most jobs I highly enjoyed it when I started. After a few years it weighs on you and with no advancement unless someone leaves and corporate didn't cut their position there is much stagnation. The goals are high and although they won't outright fire you it starts the clock before they fire you. The company culture is to cut employee benefits when corporate needs to cut costs. All in all it could be worse but I wouldn't suggest making a career out of it unless you really enjoy selling and brown nosing.
good,"I worked as a Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent for a Best Buy store. The culture of the work environment was somewhat casual and decently flexible. However, management quality was very poor, morale was low, and the productivity requirements were higher than was reasonable. Working at Best Buy is either the best or the worst, depending on what the quality of your particular store is, especially management."
good,"This was my first job and it was really easy to make friends with the team and the store motto is ""One team, one dream."" This is supposed to promote teamwork and working towards the same goal which is keeping the customers happy and still hitting your numbers. This phrase can also be used against you should you have anything to complain about that would inconvenience management. As long as you are part-time or in a position of management, this is a great place. If you go full time or are trying to move up in the company it becomes not as fun to work there. I've seen most of my friends who have been loyal to the company for 5+ years leave due to this. "
good,"When I first started at Best Buy I had a fantastic time, great co-workers that have turned into life long friends. A Management team that was always ready to help and look out for me.  However overtime, my direct manager has changed and it has had a massive detriment on how I feel about my position here. It's a great place to gain experience in retail and customer interactions, however, I would not recommend a career through Best Buy unless you are willing to put up with irate customers for 10+ years and grind your way through their retail ladder."
good,New workers get paid just about the same as a employee that has been working there for about three years. I do get support from managers in what I do but some managers are not professional enough.
good,Average job. Good for a high schooler looking for a part-time job. not the biggest fan of the place but it paid well. Managers oftentimes did not know what to do
good,Instead of picking employees up they tend to put you down for even the most minor of mistakes when it comes to your goal in sales. They really only look at numbers rather than the people that work for them.
good,"Best buy is great for anyone who is relatively young, knowledgable in electronics, or as a starter job. Has decent pay, but you will be working quite a few holidays and weekends are usually no exception with Best Buy. There are occasions where you will also be doing small tasks that don't really correlate with your job description. Moving up isn't too difficult but does at times have that glass ceiling kind of feel to it. The good thing is it is very difficult to get fired, usually only if you don't show up do you get fired. But overall it is a great job and the people you work with are usually great too."
good,Good career starter in retail and corporate. Hard to continue to move up due to lack of leadership skills from middle management. Lots of red tape at management level and promotions are not based on capabilities or skills.
good,It is definitely worthwhile to get into best buy retail services if you are trying to gather a sense of what it means to be sales driven. you will have to get used to reaching targets.
good,"Not a bad start. Learned a lot from here. How to deal with different customers and satisfy them, how to help the team to achieve short term goal and so on. Causal work culture is easy environment when not busy."
good,"Very fast paced and ever changing as every retail store usually is. Most District and Regional players were fair and helpful, some nepotism in some stores but over all was a great place to work."
good,"Direct management was friendly and supportive, upper level management was not so much. Would have large amounts of clients at times, and would still have upper level management upset that something they had asked wasn't done yet. That being said, within the individual departments, the friendliness and positive attitudes were there."
good,I've been learning at this job since the first day. Always being encountered with new problems that are in need of solutions. They gifted me with that experience.
good,Good for high school students. Very cutthroat and political work atmosphere.  I don't recommend this job for anyone looking for a career. Very high turnover rate.
good,Life at best buy was not all bad. It had its good moments and some of my team members made that job alot of fun. The worst part about it was the holiday season. Working log hours and the pay is just not enough for that in and out grind that the company puts you through and sometimes during the holidays the store goals are soo outlandish that its stresses everyone out. They are not paid by commission which is the silver lining. But with the pressure to work long hours during the holidays with very little appreciation for the upper management. It just made that time of year very un settling
good,"Work and personal life was a very understanding and very flexible schedule, lot of Favorite tism among coworkers with management. Geek Squad, thrived on the customer is always right."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Was very stressful and the managers are not honest and don't respect you. Would not recommend it to anybody that is looking for a job. DO have a flexible schedule.
good,You have to be attention to detail and self disciplined. Work in team and meet targets on time. Safety rules have to be followed. Work place is so noisy as you will work next to running conveying system.
good,"Fair for a corporate company.  Great if you are in school as they offer tuition reimbursement.  The best part was my colleagues, the worst part was the management. The benefits are nice but pay isn't great.  No overtime, opportunities for advancement were there but not great."
good,"Working for Geek Squad was stressful, but sometimes rewarding. Hardest part of the job was teaching customers how to work devices, which means that they would come in less. Repeat customers tended to be the ones that were the hardest to deal with -- the most prone to having complaints."
good,Worked there for six years and all training was just additional paperwork that needed to be completed by management rather than any defined path for growth. Not a good place to work if you want to gain valuable skills that are relevant to anything outside of retail.
good,"Coworkers seemed nice, but as seasonal, they didn't seem to care much about your strengths, or having you work in the area that you're best suited for. Online trainings were informative. "
good,"Working at bestbuy was a good experience. Overall I liked the job and the people i worked with, but didnt recieve enough hours and wanted a job with better pay aswell, which led me to making the decision to leave the company."
good,"Never has there been a more explicit example of a company that has no idea what an entire group of their employees does. I felt like our store's management no only did not care about our department, but also had no idea how it was run or what we did. Our sales staff was poorly trained through most of my tenure at this company and I would often have to correct invoices for parts, materials, and labor costs. Customers were often quoted for wildly inaccurate prices which created a very poor customer experience, and a stressful customer service experience on our part. Autotechs are paid slightly higher than most other non-management in a location but are responsible for their own tools. I often felt like I was running my own business in the install bay, and never had much support from other staff."
good,"It was a decent school job. Store manager was great, some other lower managers were meh, while some were good. Discounts were nice on certain things and back when I worked there, actual knowledge was taught. Pretty sure the business has gone more corporate mainstream with scripts and very minimal teaching."
good,"Best Buy has taught me a lot of great things, and I enjoy working there. I am just ready for a new challenge. I have met people I will not forget and many have taught me things I use on a daily basis."
good,"Full time employees get great benefits, part time employees the 401k and that's about it. That being said, the job is a great introduction to how corporate IT works."
good,"I got hired at BestBuy right after high school, it was a great starting job that gives you an idea of other things and basic customer service. Unfortunately, it feels like the company does not really care about there employees even the full-timers."
good,"Start work at prescribed hour"
good,"Worked in small department within a large company."
good,"I've worked at Best Buy for 2 and a half years. I've transferred into three stores. Management is very cliquey and tends to hire who they like more often than who is best for the role. This has been a standard at each store I've worked in. Good temporary job or first job, but not a lifelong investment unless you're best friends with someone on the inside"
good,it was an easy job fun day learnt a lot and expand my knowledge on computers and software this job also  it helped me pay my way through university till I graduate
good,"I was used like a paper towel but I guess they had pretty sweet benefits. I was doing things that a manager or supervisor should be doing, but without the pay, recognition, and if I did anything that the leadership team also did(which they weren't supposed to be) , I'd get talked to or written up for it. It's really a clique, and once they don't like you they'll find a reason or way to move you out and be extremely insincere right to your face.Fake fake fake."
good,"I have heard that a lot of people have great success at Best Buy, depending on store location."
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for with a lot of benifits. The Mount Vernon Location is not the ideal location. The management staff lacks communication and guidance. There is no concern about how much money the store is loosing so it makes it difficult to properly do your job in Opertaions.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,You are always aware of the latest and greatest being offered to the consumer public. A wonderful atmosphere to play while you learn. Relaxed work envoronment
good,Recommend for anyone in school. After graduation I would recommend leaving. Not many positions available for moving up. I've seen many managers either quit or get fired in a short 5 year span.
good,"Nice co workers, nice leaders but mangers and supervisors are untimely when solving issues. Lots of favoritism and unfair scheduling and time off requests."
good,"It was an ok starter job, you are able to grow if they like you. You do need to sell even though you dont make commission. People there are a lot of fun and dont take work so serious"
good,"I may have had an unfortunate store with an unfortunate manager. The assistant manager that was there at the time (he has since been terminated) was definitely top 2 worst leaders i have ever worked with. The general manager at that store was one of the top 3 best leaders i have had the pleasure to work with. I think this influences my review. "
good,"I'm sure that as long as its not the holiday season, it's not terribly busy, but if it is you're going to do a lot of walking. Don't expect fellow workers to have time to help you."
good,I'd have to say that with all things being considered Best Buy was pretty much a great place to work as long as you didn't face up to the pressure of having to sell because I never works there as sales staff so I never had to worry about trying to get people to buy things they wouldn't necessarily want to buy. Being asset protection at Best Buy was boring at times but you still felt like you could influence the inner workings of the store so it was nice I just wish that my management at the time was more receptive to my ideas for guarding the job itself
good,"I can't speak for the rest of Best Buy cause I was just a Samsung rep, but from what I've seen and heard, Best Buy is not that bad of a place to work. just gotta watch yourself in there because people may not all be who they claim and can throw you ""under the bus"" if your not careful."
good,It's ok to place to work very sales driven. Great if you are into technology and want to see the latest electronics.Lots of room to advance. Can be stressful at times.
good,Going back to work for best buy would be questionable. HR was all over the place. Some of the managers were not understanding. I dont like giving my number out and they had my number posted on the wall.
good,The managers had favorites and it really showed ive almost been there a year and have constantly work hard and they still rufuse me a full time position because of their favorite people
good,I have worked for other big-box corporations before and they are by far NOT the worse. They are very fiscally conservative so be on the lookout for restructures and cost-cutting happening often.
good,Had to learn product knowledge on your own. Management is not the best a lot of managers have their favorite employees and that could be an issue when you are looking for hours to work.
good,"they require you to do a lot of things on your own without management support. The pay is decent, but the stress you will encounter is not worth the trouble you're going to go through."
good,"This company isn’t bad to work for, but if you ever have problems, good luck getting HR to step in. The managers put their friends in leadership, people get passed up for positions that go to under qualified people. There’s lots of drama and competition ever if there doesn’t need to be. To get forced to sell as if you’re on commission, but you’re not on commission, the managers just want their bonuses."
good,The company is really good and I like what they stand for but unfortunately management falls short of those same values. When I asked about learning new responsibilities they never made the effort to schedule me or train me in other parts of the store. I also have caught my manager lying directly too me. The company offers good benefits which is why I have stayed as long as I have.
good,The culture and Geek Squad management were great. The realities of the roles and when facing client issues is extremely difficult. Counter Agents are constantly punching bags for clients that are upset with technology. Sometimes repairing tech is a rare pleasure.
good,You have to be best friends with managers in order to move up in the company. Most people who got promoted were because they would play video games online with the managers. The only bright side is that they work with your school schedule.
good,"Best Buy can be a bit of a mixed bag to work at. As it can highly depend on the location of the store, work culture and management to effect your work experience. I have worked at three different best buy in my life and all 3 were completely different experiences as Management can seemingly be flexible with their decision to change the stores operations."
good,"Best Buy offers great employee benefits. Not only the discounts, but the education, 401k, and medical benefits are pretty good. Not a bad place to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"If you're interested in pursuing a career in the tech field (getting into car or home installations or working for Geek Squad) then I would highly recommend working for Best Buy. They give great entry level experience and look good on resumes for future career paths. I've seen many of my colleagues go on to bigger and better things (working for schools, hospitals and court offices)."
good,"I have worked for 3 different Best Buy stores and the experience you will encounter varies widely based on store and market. Houston, TX is a better market than St Cloud, MN and the stores typically have better management. On the other hand, scheduling is highly erratic and managers are less willing to listen. There are no part time benefits but the full time benefits are good. I would say pay practices are a bit antiquated and leave a lot to be desired especially since the new bonus system seems to pay out less than the old one did. If you like to sell technology and services its a good place to work, but managers are not the best at listening if you want to do any of the other roles."
good,Great way to get some entry level sales training. They had a good work environment. They were also very flexible and would work around my schedule/ availability.
good,I learned a lot coming from Mcdonald's. I knew going in that it would be a slower paced job. I always wanted results from my team and I got everyone on the same page.
good,good Place to work. Work environment is good. GM is understood your needs. Schedule is very flexible. As a Part -time employee have a good experience with Best Buy.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Best Buy was meeting random customers everyday because you never know who could come in there. Also, getting the updates on the latest technology and actually getting a chance to test some products out was cool."
good,"As an inventory specialist, you're expected to do quite a bit. I feel that, Best Buy does not staff well for Inventory. For what they are expected to do, I feel as though that the associates in the warehouse deserve more."
good,I loved the job and most of my coworkers. But I quickly found out that if someone had better numbers they could get away with anything in the store and management wouldn't bat an eye. There were favorites and double standards all around. Expectations for sales goals could also go out the window at times with management expecting goals be reached when there weren't even enough customers to be able to meet goals.
good,Bestbuy has really gone down hill for its employee experience. I have seen almost everyone I work with leave for better jobs because they are under paid and overworked over the last 10 years. They all have left for better paying jobs and that are less stressful. Management doesn't hold anyone accountable. The few working hard and carrying the rest of their department get burnt out.
good,"If you know tech and like talking about it, this is a fun environment. But be prepared for management to hound you on reaching quotas for services, sign ups, and revenue. Few benefits for part-time and none for seasonal, plus mandatory trainings and e-learnings are regular. It's retail, so it's certainly not perfect, but it's not terrible either."
good,"This is a job that is little more than what you would expect from a fast food restaurant or any other minimum wage job. There is little advancement opportunities. Work culture and overall management is hit or miss depending on the location you work. Not a terrible job, but not a career."
good,"Management always played favoritism for certain employees. They promised promotion opportunities but never followed through on their promises. Management at the time was very unorganized and have done very underhanded things such as stealing, following false protocol that they claimed that was part of the policy."
good,"Apply for Best Buy, the parent company, because Future Shop has been closed down in Canada"
good,"A typical day at Best Buy usually included fast paced tasks that were completed both in a group setting and individually. "
good,"Bestbuy is a easy place to work at but since it’s easy the pay will not go far. Maybe a part time job at best Buy is better than a full time job, great discount by the way ."
good,"If you're in need of an easy job in sales or tech, this is it. If you want a career, diagonally transfer from some other company's management and you're in. Trying to work up from the bottom is folly of the highest order unless you fit well under a desk."
good,Very busy but great place to learn about tech. The location o the store is very good as it brings more customers over and to reach market and sales revenue target.
good,"Worked there in college, and enjoyed the work. I do not have any recent experience working there. While I was there they went from experts in each department to expecting 1 person to cover half the store and lost a lot of credibility."
good,It's not a bad place to work. I would say it's a good start job but wouldn't make a career out of it. to much politics sometimes and not enough compensation. I would deaf say better for the younger college student high school job.
good,"BBY helped me make it through college. Pay isn't great, but most people don't stay very long.  Conflicts were not existent, and the management where I worked was great."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management didn't care for its employee, saw them a disposable items.  Management only showed up to work to sit down, and let low management do all the work and take credit for how good the store is doing."
good,declining to complete a review.  As I am neutral in my review.  Everyone was great in the role that they were hired to do.  Work life balance could have been addressed.
good,"i applied for the store, went in for the interview and ended up getting a call from the best buy mobile store. "
good,It's like they dangle a carrot and then pull it away when you reach for it. The lunches are very short. good benefits. Tough goals set at the store level
good,"Good benefits are the discounts offered to the employees, nice way to save some money and still purchase nice things. Discount was variable and dependent on brand"
good,It really comes down to how comfortable an employee is working in a fast paces retail environment with endless tasks. If you have been working there for five plus years It might be wise to consider another field. Job promotions take a long while and some may even say its who you know.
good,"Just if you're not in with the ""crowd"" there isn't much opportunity for you. Unless you prove yourself, even then, sometimes that isn't enough. Working your butt off really doesn't get rewarded. Management is very unaccountable."
good,Best Buy is a good company their discount really depended on the brand which kind of sucked but great if it were a Best Buy brand. Management was bad but there was really good managers. It’s a stressful work environment so if you can’t handle the pressure or the anxiety it comes with it’s not a good place to work.
good,"lots of work and training you have to take tests every other week "
good,"it was alright to work there. The management was alright. The pay was alright. It was just a job. Nothing special, nothing terrible. It's a good stepping stone."
good,Good for college kids and kids wanting extra income. Wouldn't recommend full time. Lots of favoritism from management and lots of people doing things they were not trained to do.
good,The management does not know  geeksquad at all and offer services that are impossible. This created a work space that felt unsupported and demanding. This also leads to customers not grasping our work
good,"In everything you do, expect the number one priority to be the company, over everything else. They do respect you and the customers/clients, but if any need impedes the business, it will be addressed sternly."
good,"It was fun when I first started,  but as time went on and people began to shift that's when things started going south. I had went on an approved vacation that I requested about 2 months in advance, I came back and was no longer employed. The only excuse given to me was""Oh we thought you quit"", now how is that possible when clearly that's was all a lie."
good,"This job has the potential to be a good one, but the leaders hire their friends and if you're not one of them, it's going to be a bad time. Make the right choices so you can cover yourself when the time comes."
good,"Management can be unsupportive, work-life balance is low, especially at holidays. The pay is average, but the product discount is good. The try to make you feel like part of a team."
good,"Retail isnt for everyone, it can be very stressful and there is no steady schedule. However, I enjoyed the people I worked with and felt management cared about its employees. I was given opportunity to progress and climb during my employment. Overall fair company to work for."
good,"Overall working at the company was about what I expected as a first-time job. However, when it comes down to it, management was weak, employees were allowed to essentially walk around and talk with other departments while ignoring their own, and little was done to correct the problem. Often, while working I'd have to leave my department in computers and home office to assist in mobile or gaming. The employee breakroom was fairly run down with little attention paid to it. When closing, it was required that all employees assist with cleaning up their areas. Most of the time, however, only one or two departments would actually clean while the others stood at the front and talked amongst themselves."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,They stated it's not about to sale but to care for the customer and even though you are paid hourly.  If you don't sale you don't get hours.  Also you have to come in for midnight releases of Video Games
good,Good environment to learn about technology and future tech trends. a good place to sell and help customers find the right products that will help them succeed
good,"It has a very good team feel, and your coworkers become like family. However, the supervisors don't always follow protocol for situations and are quick to fire people off rumors or assumptions with no evidence, and don't come to the worker ""at fault"" in person to let them know they are doing something wrong."
good,"The employee discount was pretty great for the items that it was eligible for. There were several resources available for new employees to learn quickly about the product they were selling. However, we were not actively encouraged to learn about items and procedures from other departments. It was very much a sales oriented position without commission as they encouraged employees to achieve a certain amount of sales per shift. The departments were eligible for a monthly bonus if their relative percentage was higher than other departments. All in all, it's a good company to work for if you want to learn customer service skills and get a good discount on most electronics/accessories."
good,"I specifically worked at the Geek Squad City facility in Brooks, KY.  I was there from the beginning and advanced 4 positions while I was there.  It was a overall fine experience.  I loved the Geek Squad Culture, but that quickly shifted away to more of a warehouse culture as the years came."
good,"Most of the work day would be interesting and fun interactions with customers. I learned a great deal of patience from some customers that were very upset. The management seemed concerned more about the bottom line, than with customer satisfaction and employees being under paid."
good,They have pretty decent discount programs at best buy but that seems to be the best part about working there aside from working face to face with customers. However it is mentally and almost emotionally draining working as part of a corporate machine for minimum wage.
good,"I have worked here for about 8 months now and have felt that the management team lacks leadership skills. I was struggling in my position in trying to figure out how to do my job properly, and got no further training upon noticing the struggle. I expected them to review my work and to step in and take action, but nothing was done and they continued to let me do my job wrong."
good,"I worked for this company for over 4 years. The company as a whole offers great benefits to all its employees. At store level, most stores honor their employees but management does pick favorites. So be careful with who’s bad side you get into. From personal experience, many of your opportunities will be cut short and there will be little to no chance of advancement."
good,Best Buy is a great company if you are young and looking to have fun with a first job. But there is not much opportunity to advance in your career here.
good,Departments and department Leaders assigned to narrow scope of expertise for best customer experience.  There was a culture of walls between departments which did not promote team work or comradery.
good,"Best Buy is fine but its behind the times. You'll often have understandably angry customers taking their frustration with the automated call system out on you by the time you answer the phone. You will frequently need to take painfully cringe worthy online lessons for new policies or deals. These changes happen so often in their attempts to keep up with modern competition its almost impossible to keep track of what the current policies and membership possibilities are, and which have expired. My location was not above bending the rules to get better numbers than other stores, including asking me to refuse returns to people within policy. Representatives would tell the customer that the return was not possible at our location, the customer would show the representative the sentence on the receipt that reads: ""This item can be returned to any Best Buy location,"" and if this was taken to management, they would ask the representative to deny the return regardless. I must stress that I can only speak for the location that I worked at. THIS IS NOT A BLANKET STATEMENT FOR ALL OF BEST BUY (I mean it could be. maybe they all do this. I don't know.)"
good,"Its a fun time, ability to advance to a point. My store was mis-managed but no indication that this is company wide. Loved the other staff though it was difficult to find reliable co-workers. Had decent opportunity. Fun work but a dying industry thanks to the likes of Amazon and other online sellers."
good,the long hours and my hour drive to work really is why I had to leave and it was just a seasonal job so come January I would have gotten layed off. so im looking for a similar job
good,"You check in and sell from your zoned department. The most enjoyable part of the job is the regulars and some of the employees, who truly care about your growth in the company. Outside of that there is a lot of favoritism in the store and its hard to be recognized because they only focus on certain people who have certain sell numbers. which means regardless of you being good at customer service, you aren't rewarded for if. you are over looked for being human by what you actually sale. Its all numbers."
good,"While it was a fun place to work, there was quite a bit of favoritism in the workplace which made it not enjoyable at times. I would recommend to those who just want to work and not advance in the company."
good,"Best Buy is a great job for younger people such as high school or college students or for retirees that enjoy people and need something to do.Or for people that enjoy retail management. Otherwise, if you're an adult looking to make a living, stay far away. The hours are unpredictable and hard to get, the pay is bad and there's little to no job security. The job itself is relativity easy, but the pressure to meet quotes and make sales for low wages isn't worth the trouble. The great employee discount, meager healthcare benefits and good coworkers make it just (barely) worthwhile."
good,Its a great place to get your start with technology or other applications within the modern world. It was a decent start and granted I am not the biggest fan of retail but the culture and the colleagues are what make best buy the most enjoyable.
good,"Hours were inconsistent despite being fulltime, and managers refused to contribute to the work environment but instead called for regular associates any time a customer asked them a question."
good,"Although I had great coworkers, managers are really into favoritism. In the end, that is what caused me to find another job and leave. They would get their favorite employees advancements, more and better hours, ect."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management at my store is great. They really care about helping their employees and the customers alike. My specific store had great people and that made working there even better. The processes at geek squad are easy and useful to learn. The longer you're there, the more you see Best Buy grow as a company with constantly improving business processes and potential. Working at the company long term is very possible and provides well for the family if you work really hard and are good with people. I recommend it to anybody looking for a good part-time job too. They pay well while in college. The only problem is Best Buy's market. The customers are usually terrible. It's perfectly understandable to not know about computers and technology and ""what's possible"". The problem is just when their intelligence, patience, or overall understanding of basic logic is lacking (which seems to be pretty common among the ""people of Best Buy""). Sometimes it feels like the people of Walmart changed from PJs into normal clothes and come in. That just gives you a glimpse of how terrible it is dealing with these people, especially at Geek Squad."
good,"Your job is to sell, help customers and make sure they know about best buy credit cards, geek squad protection, price matching, and convince them to buy the more expensive product and protection. This job wasn't for me and my sales numbers represented that. I didn't like having to meet a quota. Thankfully this job isn't commission based and I was seasonal so they weren't too pushy about that for me. I loved talking to people, helping them pick the best laptop, computer, TV, or printer for them. Coworkers were awesome as well, although there is a slight competition for the having the best sales numbers in your department/store. Ours was a small store compared to the ones in our area so it wasn't too busy all the time and if there was no one in the store you either help out with restocking items, keeping the store clean, help out in other departments if needed. I learned a lot about sales, retail, electronics while working there but I am glad it was just a seasonal position."
good,"Great discounts "
good,"Come into work, check online orders, load or unload trucks, ship off online orders, work alone, clean up warehouse find products that the sales floor cannot find, store to store transfers, store to warehouse transfer, once a week truck nights usually staying until 12 midnight, (during holidays) - twice a week trucks usually leaving at 12-1am, unload trucks."
good,The culture can be fun. The work environment allows for quick  promotions. The pay is typical for what is normal for retail. Employees are usually friendly and good to work with.
good,The majority of the time things would be slow or people would want to test out items to then go buy online. However the management team would push people to close sales even if they did not have a full understanding of the product or services that were being provided. It was more focused around selling products than actually helping customers find the perfect product to fit there needs especially when it came to after purchase warranties and services.
good,decent entry level job mangers were great a fun loving and very supportive. candy on black friday fast paced enviroment. fun upbeat meetings in the morning
good,"I loved this job. Like genuinely, there was always stuff happening, super chill, easy to figure out, always food. Some of the employees were so rude though, and so gossipy it wasn't even worth it. Toxic environment. Everything is about making the sale, doesn't matter if you have to lie or not! As long as you make the sale! Management is also super messy. They don't really explain how the till works either, and if you're a couple dollars off you might as well just resign right there and then because CLEARLY that means you messed everything up or stole."
good,"You would start early, before the store opened and attempt to get any new pricing out, shelves straightened and displays turned on before the opening. "
good,Feel That it is a good jod to start with and can be helpful if still in school. There is always a point to learn and grow and its great if you are able to always be looking for the next best tech.
good,"Managers are awful and not at all coordinated, they all will tell you to do something and then the next one will tell you not to do it so you're constantly left confused and often wasting time."
good,"Honestly I  can't review my time at Best Buy because my experience is biased. A majority of what  I would say would probably be negative, however Best Buy is great depending on your managers and store."
good,The employees is what makes the company what it is today. The day to day work activities are pretty simple. They do tend to take advantage of the employees that they know will go above and beyond for the company.
good,"Nothing really to say, you will have to experience it for yourself. It' good for having on your resume but I wouldn't stay no more than 1 years. or work there seasonally."
good,"Best Buy is a good company to work for, there is a lot expected of you. It is not just individual work, they focus a lot on team work and how it benefits yourself, the store and the team as a whole."
good,"This particular location doesn't offer much room for advancement, and not much room for improvement with clear favoritism. Work can be very rewarding and fun given the situation."
good,"Best Buy is a retail sales store that does not provide commissions. Still, they have strict sales goals that employees much reach in order to stay within the company, move up, and even to not get terminated. Because of the value put on sales numbers, the work environment begins to feel almost like a commission sales job, where it becomes difficult to trust your fellow employees."
good,"As a Supervisor my typical work day was a 10-12 hour day, after being told that it would be a 8-9 hour day.  The expectations in hours worked were not realistic.  This led to turn over in Leadership. "
good,Awesome company to work for since it provided me with proper training but lacked team building skills. The hierarchy pyramid business model created a separation from new hires to the veterans. This separation of pay made a huge impact in the working environment since new hires had to learn quickly before being placed on the sales floor. Overall there is potential for growth to those that are willing to stick it out during the beginning years of minimum wage.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Not great pay or hours but pretty decent management relaxed fun environment every employee was like family just wish we were compensated more for the type of work we were doing
good,Changing of the upper level executives led to a lot of changes with the organization. New rules and restrictions were put into place and different quotas were expected. Successfully pushing credit cards and extended warranty plans are the key to getting noticed
good,I didn't enjoy my time due to favoritism in my team. My roommate was the black sheep and therefore I was also. The leader was not a good trainer and did not treat me fairly because I did not come from Best Buy as all the other employees did.
good,"Best Buy is a good first retail job. They expect results from their employees, but the compensation is higher than other retail chains, and employee benefits are decent as well."
good,"Good company, good people, fast work style n alot of different cultures n backgrounds. I had a good time working there and getting to know all different types."
good,"Working at Best Buy allows you the freedom to learn about all different types of technology from Smart TV's, Computers, Car Audio, Gaming, Home Appliance and Customer Service. Each department has its own learning training center where all employees must login and train on that departments products and customer profile. The work atmosphere is busy but relaxed at times and the best part of the job besides getting to learn all of the newest tech is the employee discounts that came with the job. The holiday season is the most stressful part of the job."
good,"Leaderships and coworkers made it enjoyable, hard work, but quick paced, hardest part of job is time management and being able to accomplish a lot of tasks in a work day."
good,"Cool place to work if you like tech. Can be fun at times. If working on the sales floor, can recieve bonuses and perks. Fun and friendly co-workers. Management seemed in over their heads a lot."
good,"Overall, its an easy job and if you're into business you can learn a lot about sales and reaching budget goals. The only thing I would complain about is the management. Some situations were handled poorly, and it made multiple employees either resign or try switch locations."
good,Good place to work.  good work life balance except in  December.  If you like tech. you would like this job.  Non commission but fun competitive sales environment.
good,"Best Buy puts on the face of a company which cares for the employees and the customers. All they care about is sales. You have the occasional story here and there where BBY went way out of their way for an employee. What they fail to mention is this only happens to salary employees. If you’re hourly, you’re treated unfairly unless you’re good friends with management outside of work. Their claim about diversity was totally bogus in my store. About 10% were female, 95% white, and almost completely straight. I hate to imply the “straight white male” concept, but it applies. I know it can vary store to store, as I regularly filled in at a location I loved to work at, but the company still needs work on the managerial level. And the hourly isn’t worth the amount of pressure you put up with on the back end."
good,Never busy except for the Holidays. Employees are always on their phones and goofing around. Not many hours given to part-timers. No job growth. I felt like a mindless monkey working there. Its so boring and everyone gets paid to barely even work. In my opinion thats not satisfying at all unless you are still in school.
good,Depending on the Store it can be a great place to work. Sometimes management alone can change how you feel at work. Some Best Buy locations do not treat there employees equally.
good,Really have to be good with head management to get anywhere. Play favorites. Managers reap all the rewards from the hard working front line. Culture is talked about but rarely shown.
good,Okay job. Sales job even when working in customer service. Overall like any job you've ever worked in your life... you make the best out of the situation.
good,At first I enjoyed my worked with Best Buy. I feel I did not quit the company however I did indeed quit a manager. He was hands down the worst manager I ever had.
good,"Customer service returns and exchanges. Ringing up products, and explaining protection plans. Attended occasional meetings, where we discussed sales, and how we can improve."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Pretty laid back.  "
good,"•	Sales to reach monthly goals"
good,"A refined knowledge base was not required prior to being expected to sell products. You'll often see associates utilizing the notation cards created for product signage, and selling based on the most minimal information. More training, or consistent milestones in training may lead to a better environment."
good,Nice cool place to work but the managers are very devious and rude to employees and co workers but other than that it was fun I feel you have to be excited about work
good,"It was a good time, if you needed help someone would help you out, training was easy. Scanning and packaging. And getting to know the people you were working with."
good,"There is very little that is different about Best Buy Canada when compared to other retail environments. They will often portray themselves as a shinning star of the retail world but can never provide proof and will always ignore any of their shortcomings without explanation."
good,"The job was okay enough but the pay does not match well with the constant pushing for numbers, hounding from incompetent management, and constant disapproval from otherwise ignorant customers."
good,"My direct manager works hard. However, I cannot say the same of the other managers. While I am running around working on pallets and helping customers I see my fellow employees standing in groups on their phones or chatting. I enjoy working at Best Buy, I just don't enjoy the lack of motivation or the laziness of certain managers/supervisors. I learned more about computers and their software as well as the order management system. I enjoyed being able to work freely and wonder the floor when helping a customer."
good,"This is a great first job, or maybe even second. I started here at a very young age and it taught me the foundations of how business are ran. Don't expect a whole lot going into a place like this."
good,"For the amount of work that you do as an inventory specialist, you do not get paid enough.  Every piece of merchandise that gets sold in the store goes through the inventory department.  For that level of responsibility, the pay is extremely low.  Always remember this, a company will only pay you what they think you're worth.  In the case of Best Buy, the company sees its employees as worthless and it's managers as its assets when it really is the other way around."
good,"Best buy was a great learning experience. However, I have to say that they wouldn't have such a high turnover rate if they valued their employees more than their products."
good,"Overall A good Job for Young Adults, over 30 you will likely be annoyed by younger know -it-alls. Established policies constantly changing. Different manager different rules"
good,The days varied. Some days were extremely busy. Others were slow. Management was willing to work with situations especially with employees suffering from Harvey.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to gain a wide capacity for technology knowledge and computer systems information. There was a lot of great compensation benefits that were given if goals were met daily, weekly, monthly. However, the culture was not that great and a lot of the people acted in selfish and immature ways throughout my time working there."
good,"I was consistently encouraged to apply for supervisory positions, but I was then rejected three times. Every time I was told that I was a great candidate but they needed me where I already was. This translated to ""We pay you $9/hr to do a supervisors job so why would we pay you a supervisors pay to do the same work?"" "
good,"How an inventory position at Best Buy works for you will be based entirely on what kind of person you are. Keeping up with orders and balancing them with inventory discrepancies, shipping and receiving, order pickups, and customer inquiries can be stressful and the pacing may get to you at times, but there are other times where the store will be slow and you'll pace around wondering what to do because your task list for the week is short, outgoing shipments are done, orders are slow, merchandising is up to date, downstocking is done, and the warehouse is in a position to close."
good,Constant management turn around hurt the business from being run effectively. Job is very flexible being that if your part time your hours are never guranteed and can be sent home early .
good,Was an average job. Really helped out when my son was born and I needed to take a leave. Turned the department I worked in upside down while I was on leave and came back to no job security and ano future with the company in sight.
good,"Average retail. The job is pretty fast paced, depending on where your department is and the time of year. Hours are usual retail hours, which means never a really consistent schedule."
good,Weekdays are normally pretty slow but weekends can be exhausting. Helps advance sales skills and communication skills. Opportunities for growth if you are willing to move around. Hardest part is relaying the same information through the day. Enjoyable part is connecting with standout customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I learned a lot about the company in the year I worked there. I was also trained very well to sell almost anything in the store. However Human Resources was contacted almost daily for issues through the store that i worked at. Management only cares about sales, it took one manager almost 4 months to learn my name, and they also refused to work with my college schedule. I was told that if i have to lower my hours a week to the minimum required that they would demote me. I was threatened my job on multiple occasions for not reaching sales goal however i held the highest customer service score in the store. Which is wrong, everything was built around beating those around me ans selling more. If you love a competitive work nature then Best Buy is great, if you want to work as a team then Best Buy sales is not for you."
good,Best Buy as a company is great to work for! They offer full time benefits and work with your schedule. Let’s you work freely and gives you the necessary training to get the job done.
good,Decent job to work at if you like making friends with coworkers. Good discount for employees. Leaders are very determined to make your life miserable.
good,"I oversaw the daily operations of the location. I would spend quite a bit of time handling customer issues either in person or over the phone. I did scheduling, HR related issues, opened and closed the location and helped with hiring."
good,"I started at Best Buy as a part-time sales associate. Because of my strong performance in sales, I was quickly moved to full-time and a few years after that I was promoted to leadership. Best Buy offers many opportunities to begin your business career. They are focused on coaching and training above your role so that you know why there are certain policies and goals in place. This is meant to grow employees' business acumen and has been a huge benefit to me in my development. One thing to note is milage may vary. There can be huge differences in manager style and this will drastically impact what kind of experience you have."
good,"It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible either. I just sold computers for the holiday season. I made 12.50 an hour, and even though they said I had more sales than permanent employees they couldn't keep me after the holiday season due to seniority."
good,Best Buy is a good company to work for as a first job. But not somewhere you want to spend your entire career. Great stepping stone job. Above average pay and busy work.
good,"I've been with the company 12 years, but once you move into a SUP role be prepared to stay forever. The pay will  be lower-middle of the road for your area. This place is great about letting your learn your role, but don't expect someone to teach you. Use this job as an active laboratory to build your resume then seek better opportunities."
good,Working in the warehouse at best buy is overwhelming and stressful. The department gets understaffed and is expected to do 3 people's jobs at once. Discount was nice but the stress that all of the physical labor and expectations puts on you is not worth it.
good,Management can be better but overall job is great. great discount and for the most part great atmosphere when management isnt stressing about hitting some type of goal
good,"a typical work day for me is currently front lanes and its slow right now. ive learned that all best buy stores are diff. there is diff cultures. hardest part of the job is not losing yourself when customers are being rude to you, enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. management at my store is pretty great."
good,Taking a customer problem and owning it allow the customer know you're there to help. Always staying in control of the phone call will display one's ability to conclude successfully.
good,it's an okay job. the management is pretty cool. they pay decently considering it's part time. definitely not a job for someone who doesn't like talking to people regularly.
good,The assistant store manager was thee worst manager I had ever dealt with. They definitely did give you all the training you need which was awesome. Would work for Best Buy again only if at a different store location then I worked at.
good,"No real comment, is a good place to start out, one of those places if you need a job and are interested in technology would be a great place to work. do not expect a great compensation package."
good,"Good job to do in the evenings and weekends, personally would not be fulfilling if I had to do it 40hrs/wk. This is assuming you have a degree, otherwise I'd imagine Best Buy is one of the relatively better retail establishments. YMMV."
good,"The people you meet in each store is very different, people love their job here despite everything going on behind the scenes. There isn't a place I've seen with more favourtism in it than Best Buy. If you don't kiss up to management, you aren't moving up at all. Managers will hire the people they are buddies with over somebody with more qualifications any day. Sometimes I feel it's a waste of time applying to move up, I don't kiss up to anybody, my skills should take me up, not who I know."
good,"The workplace can either be very stressful or enjoyable, there doesn't seem to be anything in between.  The benefits are great as long as you meet the requirement.  You have a random shot at being with"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is great for anyone who is coming out of high school or in college and want to gain retail experience in the tech field. "
good,"productive workplace with friendly staff, the people are easy to work with, the environment is safe and conducive, there are other incentives for growth"
good,The best part of this job for most will be the scheduling freedom.  It is very flexible for people who have school or other jobs.  My favorite part was the people that I worked with day to day.  The GM of my location was disconnected but everyone else was great to work with.
good,It was a fun fast paced job that always kept me in the know with new technology. They can be unfair with pay at times. I worked there for a long time and advanced to management and still made under $9 an hour.
good,Working for Best Buy was overall a negative experience. Long hours with little pay for hard labor. Employees skills are not rightfully compensated in pay or benefits.
good,i would say that on a normal day we would have to meet our goal for the day. to much micromanagement and store manager is unsuited for the position. very disappointed on  management but overall we gotta push to every customer to run credit to get the credit card but its just to have a bigger sale.
good,"well first off, the Christmas holiday was a pretty terrible time to work there. Mainly because of black Friday and not being able to take days off in December."
good,"Best Buy is great for high school students looking for a part time job.  If you're expecting to be compensated any more than minimum wage, I strongly encourage you to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"You must be active and engaged with customers, fast on your feet, up to date with the latest technology, and learn how to attach appliances to sales.fast paced and fun"
good,this was a great place for a college student because they will work with your hours for school and other event that are going on in your life. i was getting paid the money i needed at the time and the coworker were fun
good,"A typical day at work as a Geek Squad Consultation agent consisted of assisting clients at the counter with minor issues, creating paperwork for defective units to go out for repair, contacting clients with updates regarding their units in for repair and submitting escalations to make speed up repair time frame. Dealing with clients,I learned how to enhance my customer service ability by listening and understanding their needs.This job was helpful because it taught me how to perform in a quick paced, stressful environment while learning new skills such as basic computer repairs.In any jobs there are difficulties which arise due to lack of resources. There were some team members unwilling to perform up to par with the rest of the team which made working with these individuals somewhat of a hardship.Having to go above and beyond to not only compensate for these specific individuals but also make sure our clients were satisfied with the team's performance was at times difficult.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see  satisfied clients and knowing we were able to help them with their technological needs."
good,"I chose a different job because of an incident that happened. "
good,The location would determine your experience for sales but the management is poor at certain locations in the DMV area specifically.however this job is good for college students.
good,"This was a decent place to work for, but nothing really stood out. You received paid training, which is a big benefit, and they did encourage you to work as a team by having friendly competitions between stores. But the work was sometimes tough if you didn't know specifically what each and every product they sell is/does."
good,hahahah honestly it was not all that bad and if you work full time the job is a lot better all I know is that they have limited hours at bestbuy so you know.
good,"My store management at the time did not know how to schedule correctly or delegate tasks. And when it came to customer complaints, the management were disrespectful with their approach."
good,"It’s a good company to start your career."
good,People talk too much and if you aren't liked they will try to get you fired. If you aren't part of the circle than the supervisors show favoritism and won't help you advance in your career not that there is much advancement anyway
good,"One of the few enterprise environments in the Vancouver area. The company has a great culture with great people."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It was a good place to work and good morning hours. Changed prices, planograms, merchandise, downstocking. Whatever leadership assigned. I would recommend working in the warehouse."
good,Expect long hours and a quick-paced environment. There is plenty of jobs available during their season but it can become very hectic and exhausting. Expect alot of overtime during this time so it's a perfect job to have if you are looking for a short-term job with a big pay out.
good,"Worked at best buy for a sales job, not really challenging this was just while i was going to school, pretty typical minimum wage job most days was boring."
good,"It was an laid back job for a college student. Job consisted of greeting customers and checking receipts. Some customers would get annoyed by that but hey, it's a job. Management would grill you for not selling enough and failing to meet the day's sale goal."
good,"This company has undergone a lot of changes but when I worked for them they lacked integrity. The store I worked for always had cut backs, and their security was a disaster."
good,Everyone I started with and everyone there from before I started has quit. This is just my location though. I have been to others that are managed much better.
good,"Best Buy will do a good job in teaching skills that are needed in other types of jobs. Its not going to be a 9 to 5 with weekends off and holidays. Its a retail store. Some managers are great. Some managers are average. Working in a best buy that is near tourist attractions and gated communities are amazing. However, working in Best Buy stores that are in poor cities are not. The product availability is based on the region location. If one becomes a manager be prepared for stress. The pay is great but the work life balance is not. If one is looking to start a family or sustain a family do not manage in a Best Buy store. Let me just say I would not recommend it. Use Best Buy to grow. There are great training incentives, programs, and eLearnings that will excel the career of an individual that capitalizes on them."
good,No job security - do more with less is  the company motto. You can be a district manager one day and an hourly employee the next. Entire stores close with no notice to employees and no offers for relocation.
good,"The company keeps changing managers in store so they don't know there employees for very long to know there strengths and weaknesses. They don't keep track of there employees stats in selling like Future Shop did to help management organize there crew. It is a good starting company to work at though, with potential benefits to help those starting in life."
good,"fun work environment. management is all over the place. pushing for sales and not concerned with employees. good employee discount program, benefits could be alot better"
good,we have ping pong in-house torment every year.
good,"Work was pretty simple, most of my coworkers were fun to work with, management could have been better. I had to train myself to do everything, including using their annoying software to stock."
good,"I really liked my most recent position as a sales consultant at Best Buy as it really let me practice my knowledge in computers out in the real world. The managers are trained to push sales very fast especially on seasonal workers and do their best to train them. I have noticed customers that come in that were guaranteed certain items have to deal with the general manager who has to refer to corporate protocol that ultimately makes the customer angry and the sales people have to deal with that. This makes the sales consultants uniquely good at customer service, but it is not how business should be done."
good,"i have worked for Best Buy almost 2 years and love the job/coworkers. the problem is i have worked very hard to get a full time position even the i work full time hours, and the management has still passed me over for full time positions. it seems the only way to move up with the company is if you smile and nod all the time, you don't actually have to contribute anything"
good,Was a fun place to work if everyone showed up ready to work. Many employees there only for a paycheck and didn’t care for their job. Favoritism is huge in a big box environment.
good,the day starts with me clocking in whenever I'm supposed to. then i have to go to the back room and grab a clipboard that they pretty much force you to use to sell geek squad services. they say best buy is not commission in terms of product sales but its commission in terms of geek squad services. whether that be geek squad protection or geek squad home memberships. they also want you to always try to attach accessories to each sale. I'll admit the people are great and they have events for the employees and such but the geek squad is being shoved down the employees and the customers throats.
good,This was my first job out of school. When I started working here it was an amazing work environment and everyone in the store got along. Training was very straightforward and I knew everything I needed to do in my position. Management changed after a few months and I decided I wanted to change positions within the company. After the change in positions the training for the new position was lacking and I didn't know half of the things I needed to know when they ultimately left me on my own some days so lots of mistakes happened that got pinned on me. Even after bringing up the fact of lack of training with management in an earlier meeting with them.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Let me start off by saying the coworkers and management at Best Buy are very kind and fun to work with. The issue isn’t the people or work environment itself. The issue here is the pay. If you are in high school then this will be a great first job for you. But as an adult I am disgusted that Best Buy has the audacity to give you a quota/track your sales/give you a sales goal & not pay you commission! I was put in connected home with a 12$ an hour pay. But I was still activating phones and not getting paid for it. People who work at ATT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile make a lot of money in commission! Not only that but the hiring process and training process is very intense for a job that pays practically nothing. You have to get promoted to become a full time associate! I was surprised to look around at my peers and not see shock or disgust on their faces while talking about this! They can afford to pay commission! They just don’t want to! They have the nerve to try to say no commission is a good thing. It’ll take away competitiveness! Yeah it’ll also take away your paycheck! Do not work for this company if you’re a self respecting adult! Love the managers and coworkers but Best Buy is a greedy company. "
good,"5-8 hour work day, selling on the sales floor is a must, getting credit applications is a must, engaging customers is a must. The hardest part is the selling and engaging sometimes it feels fake. Management has good selling skills and likes to pass them on. The most enjoyable is the work culture, Best Buy likes to have fun. You keep up with all the new technology and training so you learn a lot."
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customers with any questions they may have on primarily cameras (my department, Digital Imaging) and secondly computers (PCHO) or Apple products."
good,"I would go into work and get my clients that I had for the day and go to house to house servicing or installing their equipment they had purchased for the store. Management staff was hard to work with buy giving jobs that couldn't be done or would go into overtime and they didn't want to pay overtime. "
good,Great for a part time job while attending school. Good exposure to technology. No commissions enable the customer to be trusting of the salesman. Sales training is also good.
good,Customer Solutions Specialist Best Buy. ✓ Gather information about customers through conversation. Discover the best technology solution based on the information gathered.
good,"Has the potential to be an amazing job, there just isn't incentives to strive for greatness. The entire store has to do well for you to receive any bonus. The issue with that is no matter how much you sale or how hard you work for the sale you will not be compensated fairly."
good,"Typical day at work involved helping and educating clients with their technology, troubleshooting & repairing technology, and a great deal of paperwork with every interaction."
good,I only worked part-time so i didn't get any benefits but they offered great benefits to full-time employees. It was stressful but manageable. You get what you put into the job.
good,"Good benefits, and good co-workers. Some times superiors needed to be a little bit more personal. Didn't make time to help with problems. Just focused on telling you what you did wrong."
good,"bestbuy is a good job to start in, you learn a lot about the products, are required to meet sales every day but they put a lot of stress for the pay. holiday are the busiest. most enjoyable part is working with great people and the discount for the products you can buy."
good,"I watched young people without any real life experience get hired into leadership positions because they worked there a couple of years, where as I had over 20 years of leadership and management experience from the military and owning my own franchise stores for 8 years. I was told that my previous experience was not Best Buy experience so it did not count. I quit."
good,I was told at the outset that I would get at least 30 hours a week and only got 2 shifts per week.  Their reason was that they had allocated too many hours to training and there weren't enough for me.  I actually needed more hours and they said it wouldn't be a problem.  I guess they want a bunch of part timers but don't realize that training and turnover cost more than just giving more hours to good employees.
good,"While the people you work with will usually be awesome, everything else turned into high stress. They wanted nothing but the best sales and even top performers didn't get taken care of. The ability to grow with the company is hard and long, for some taking many years before going a step up."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working for them.  I just did not like that within the two years that I was there, the store had gone through three general mangers and things were constantly changing, drastically."
good,A typical day of work involved me standing in corner greeting people all though my position was cashier I hardly checked people out . The reason being they where checked out by my colleagues.
good,"overall my experience with the company was a pleasant one that is why I was there for over 10 years, good culture, aggressive selling. Management needed work, micro managing employees do not keep them engaged"
good,it was a basic retail job with basic pay. what i like the most was that thier products was alot of what i would usually buy so it was nice getting to see the latest tech first
good,"Not the greatest place to work if you are goal oriented its more of an hourly job without any commission but you are treated like you need to sell, sell, sell but there is never any reward for the work."
good,"Petty enviroment, managers as well as employees are too argumentative and hold grudges. Unfair treatment for employees who do badly at their jobs at the cost of others time and effort."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at best buy is great if you are a student they are willing to work with your schedule. The General manager is a micro manager which gets in the way of store morale but when he's not there it has a great atmosphere. Most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits, there is a great discount. The hardest part of the job is the work schedule is always random and you never have the same days off and many schedules take up your entire day."
good,Best Buy used to be the best company I ever worked for. With that said they changed their management structure and the customer service ideals and culture that made them successful. After that it just became a disaster with no real vision or focus.
good,Solid pay. Solid benefits. Coworkers create a fun culture. Lots of social activity with coworkers outside of work. Days can be long because of slow customer traffic. Very structured selling style with constant managerial oversight.
good,This is a great job while in college or high school. If your top in your department you work the most and have the worst hours (busy hours) because of your abilities to preform better. If you want a fun job with tuition reimbursement and benefits during school I would highly recommend this job.
good,Overall i feel that the experience and knowledge gained for this work experience was not bad. Co workers offered good advice and experience. Discounts where okay
good,Best Buy is a typical retail store. There are multiple departments you can work/grow in. I was able to transfer through multiple Best Buy stores and leadership was different in every store.
good,I had a good time working at this position. Part time working 2 jobs and the pay was good. Hours started slow then ramped up. But I was let go of the job with no notice.
good,"A typical day at best buy, clock in and walk around trying to find customers to help primarily in your department, and operate front cash registers when they were backed up with a long line. You had to really sell items as if you were on commission but you do not make commission. You are being tracked hourly by your individual sales and you have goals to meet every week and month. If all departments hit their financial goals, then each department gets a small percentage of a bonus once for the month, each month that you hit goals collectively. You need to take what they call, e-learnings, which are little online company training courses on products that they currently sell or will sell soon. The purpose was just to gain knowledge so you are not clueless when people ask questions."
good,"The company point of view regarding the attachment of service plans, extended warranties and credit card applications was very overwhelming for many of the team members."
good,"Opened and closed the store, did inventory, balanced cash office, made deposits, wrote schedules, did evolutions, trained, coached, data entry, staff meetings..."
good,"It was fun working there with the paid breaks and good pay rate."
good,"Good simple fast pasted work environment, knowledge of the newest and latest electronics helps. management is ok helpful and nice. seasonal jobs not best idea to accept not likely to be keep on after holidays are over."
good,"Typical day at work in the morning you need to make a quota even there were no customers looking to spend $5,000 + a day"
good,"sale  all over the store, from appliances to computers routers, printers, projectors, and TV's.   I also was responsible for training employee's on printers and scanners"
good,"Good company, however some GM's don't want to pay you for your time or efforts, despite you training those under you. Those under you will make more than you (based off the new pay structure change)"
good,"Don't get paid enough with all of the responsibilities given. Culture is great. I balance repairing the computers, answers phone calls, repairing apple devices, and clients."
good,"Work was fast-paced, and management was very good. There were no advancement opportunities within the store. There was no work/life balance, only work. The workload was overwhelming with no help from sales staff, and push back with organization attempts. Management was not supportive of inventory staff unless there was a problem or something they could not find."
good,As said in the title this is a typical starting job good for a kid in high school or college.  Most of the time you are pushed to upsell product protection that customer will have no need but it's overall an easy job with little to no knowledge needed.
good,"Best buy is an okay place to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"While the managers are for the most part good people, they do not necessarily fill the managerial roll all that well. Certain associates can be pretentious, but many are enjoyable."
good,"If you like to work around people and love to help people, are competitive, not lazy, always brings your A game then working at Best Buy is perfect for you. Promotions will happen if you're ""about"" Best Buy"
good,overall best job but position wasn't for me.  Customers wasn't always friendly. The best part was working with my coworkers and the respect I have for my managers. I learned a lot from this job especially retail and how it works.
good,"It wasn't terrible working here overall. The only thing that really kind of drags on you are the customers. A lot of times it was super fun and great working with them, but other times you had to deal with entitled jerks who demand you to change corporate policy for them when they've signed a contract agreeing to something."
good,"I enjoyed my stint with Best Buy. It was due to the wonderful colleagues I had, and that included my line manager. The management though was very biased towards whites and that was the reason I couldn't move up the ladder inspite of being one of the best consultants."
good,"The compensation at Best Buy is very poor. While not paying commission is good for the consumer, the bonuses are lacking. Management does not have a clue what they're doing because corporate makes changes so often."
good,"Best Buy provided many lessons when it came to Business and Sales. Management were usually overworked themselves which typically led to a cutthroat environment with many decisions based off emotion. Great place to learn Sales and everything thats involved including various techniques and the phycology behind human behavior. Since the employees worked so many hours and every single weekend, the employees tend to become great friends which made the work environment exciting. There was not much life balance outside of work since weekends were a requirement"
good,"Nobody really cares about you and its changed to a sell-or-else job instead of truly helping customers or putting their needs first."
good,"Just know that even if you stick your head out for them and cut an arm and leg for them- they won't care. It's ALL business. Who cares about feelings from associates. they just want their numbers up, and once they're up they just want more. Never really appreciate you. But you learn a lot. I loved learning about HT/appliances/gaming/computers. It's fun & they do have some fun activities. Plus be careful what you say. Managers act like they're your friends but they use everything against you...I loved the experience I got here don't get me wrong...but they really did screw me over :/"
good,Non existent management when its needed the most. Pay is not enough to cover the amount of work that is expected to be done. If they gave more consistent raises work would not be to bad.
good,"swipe in, log onto your computer and set up all of your applications, also log into your phone. You will either have to answer inbound or outbound calls."
good,Working at best buy is a great experience if you like sales and technology. Your coworkers are like family but management isn't the best. Management takes the customers word over yours and will even undermine your bonus potential to bend over backwards for a customer. Pay is awful a fun the bonuses are a joke. Best buy as a corporate company seems to care more for the employees than actual management does.
good,"ok place to work  but the management treats you like your in high school and the management treats you like you don't know anything"
good,"Relatively easy job, but very little emphasis on personal performance.  Bonuses and pay increases are based mostly on store performance vs individual performance."
good,"The people at Best Buy are what kept me there for 7 years. It is a great job for a single person, but once you want to start a family it is rough. At my current store, as a leader you must request time off WELL in advance (often 2-3 months ahead of time). Family time is not valued at Best Buy. Surprise parties for birthdays or quick weekend trips with your family and friends are impossible to get off unless you request the time off before anyone else does. If you don't plan your year in January you'll be selecting from random, undesirable times for your time off. You cannot request a single day off between Nov. 1 and Jan 15. They give you plenty of PTO, but unless you call in sick frequently, it is impossible to use it all. I have given 40-50 hours back to the company every year I have been in leadership at Best Buy. The pay is OK, but it often feels like there is not enough support to run the store properly. Late nights and almost 0 weekends off per year gets draining really fast if you have a family you would like to see."
good,Management at my store was horrible and uncaring. They will pay people with no experience more than you. They do this to increase the number of hires and in turn cause people to quit.
good,"Basic retail job at an electronics store. The management was fine but there was a heavy expectation to reach goal by the end of the day. If you didn't make it you were sure to be visited by district the next day."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Over the year that i was at Best Buy I really enjoyed my job. I worked with some great people, and it was a fun place to work. I also saw a lot of people come and go. The time I started and by the time I had left about 70% of the staff was new. In the span of only a year! A big component to that was the gossipy, unprofessionalism of the management."
good,"This is a great place to start working in IT. you will learn so many skills so fast that they will get you basic to advanced knowledge that will help out in the field if you decide to stay. The customers can be a pain at times but that should be expected. Also the possibility to grow or even earn a minimal raise DOESN'T exist. So take what you can, but don't stay to long"
good,Direct managers and GMs are there to support an help with the day to day job role. Seem higher up and outside of the store staff is out of touch with the stores them selves.
good,i don't have much to say about best buy because i haven't worked there in two years. much has probably changed since then and i don't want to make assumptions about it is now compared to then.
good,"I would have highly recommended Best buy 5-10 years agos, but the slope was slippery, and the decent was steep and quick. They abandoned all loyalty and career advancements as they started losing money and haven't looked worse. Decent starter job, but just to grab experience for better opportunities."
good,"Not much room for advancement. Worked full-time hours but kept as part-timer. Personally, I committed myself to move up in the company but things turned out differently."
good,Depends on the department and the role you are in; the working experience can vary a great deal. Some positions are high pressure and high reward; other could be mundane and uninspiring - so choose wisely.
good,The work environment from changing to geek squad from a computer sales associate was great. The folks in the geek squad department was a pleasure to work with.
good,the environment here was pretty laidback and relaxed come in and do your work there would never be a problem. they gave alot of extra hours but 6pm-4am with one 30 min break and alot of lifting was a bit much.
good,Best Buy is a good place to work if you're full time. As a part time associate with a lot of bills I barely get any hours which makes no difference when there's no hours.
good,"follow how the current manager wants you to talk and approach customers and keep up with all your sales.. everything will be fine! "
good,"Best Buy is a pretty good company. You meet some very nice coworkers, feels like a team. The benefits are surprisingly great. Good health/dental/vision and plenty of paid time off for full timers. Both full/part time get monthly bonuses depending on meeting revenue goals for the store as a whole... which happens pretty regularly. If you like electronics it can feel like being a kid in a candy store sometimes."
good,"It's retail and that's that. But, there is mobility in the company  outside the retail dept i.e. IT. The retail side is very grueling and you are require to know alot of software tools along the way and the products as well. If you don't they will cut your hour like no other because they don't fire, they make you quit."
good,"no hours for part timers, also no benefits. good enviorment and team work. good merchandise discounts for employees.poor management.I feel good to work there"
good,"I have worked at Best Buy off and on for years and honestly it can be the best retail job, but it all depends on leadership. I had managers who did not play favorites and made my time enjoyable, but others are biased towards certain employees. Sales goals make sense in this environment, but instead of trying to make your department successful employees steal sales from each other and create a hostile environment."
good,This was a seasonal position and they made it easy. All I did was check people out and stock a coke machine. Even when working on Thanksgiving they had lots of free food for employees and cots for naps.
good,Cristina the home theater manager is much needed of a anger managment check yes it is a great place to work but the revenue was extremely stressful and she would hound you to no end like i couldnt be me
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Cashier work was pretty easy once you got used to trying to sell customers protection plans. There was opportunity to move up in company. Great employee discounts on majority of store items.
good,"Working here was a blast mostly because of the people you work with. Like any sales job, you have to deal with irritable customers. Great discounts and a more relaxed sales environment makes up for it though."
good,"stressful, the managers pressure you to sell sell sell. The environment was much more friendly before the stock market crash  in 2007. Before than it wasn't only about business, but providing a great experience for customers."
good,"Working at best buy is a great experience. It is a good place to develop skills and master the craft of being social."
good,"Inconsistent hours, a lot of promises that don't get fulfilled like compensation for work as a team or individually. you will work every department eventually guaranteed if you stay long enough. Rest assured they will reel you in year by year with  promises and  a lot of changes that wont happen but you will feel as if you are part of a team and matter by what management says but wont be reflected in your reviews. but there are a lot of new products and toys to look forward to every day and year that you will loathe and love stocking and selling to your customers."
good,"I think I was placed in a good location, luckily. I am not sure my experience at Best Buy is a typical one. "
good,Bestbuy is a fun place to work because you get a great discount and you learn a lot of new things! They had a hard time with management when I worked there so it made it a little less fun.
good,"Some in leadership will want to keep you down if you are a great performer. They claim to want to groom you into leadership positions but will only do so if it benefits them. They prefer to keep you in their department because you help them reach goals, but if you want to leave and move up? They will drag you down. Selfish."
good,Think of it as high school for adults. Everyone knows everything about everyone- and it sure to let you know it. Positions seem to only be offered to those that brown-nose management and hard-work seemingly goes unnoticed.
good,Good and people friendly place to work. The company is very smart in changing with the times and advanceing when the time is needed. They seem to live by their values.
good,"Best Buy was a good place to work but if you plan on making a career out of it your options are pretty limited within the IT sector. "
good,"Management here has not been the best. Many of the employees are great to work with, professional, and management should have a better valuation of them, as they currently like to underpay their staff."
good,"If you are at a store with low turnover, be sure to move on/out quickly unless you want to become one of the empolyees that have been in an entry level position for 5+ years."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits and work environment. Excellent pay compared to other retailers. Job security is good. Managers care about the workers.
good,A typical day would start by applying price changes though out the store. I learned Best Buy sales change frequently. The management was alright most were helpful but not knowledgeable and some couldn't find time to properly help out. The culture is fantastic a bunch of geeks in one place what could be better? The hardest part of the job was communication a lot of problems could be handled better and efficiently . I enjoyed being surrounded by new and innovative technology.
good,"Every day you have to go in with a Goal in mind, bea ble to meet the companies needs by consulting customers and being able to sell them what they need. In doing so you have to be able to apply your employee expertise to be able to get them on a best buy credit card and give them buying power. The hardest part of the ob is being able to get them to apply for the card. The most enjoyable part would be the people."
good,"A typical day at work was focused on sales and picking up slack for lazy employees.  In a store as large as Best Buy, you are bound to have employees who do not work as hard as others.  Management was ok, but workers were hounded for sales and selling accessories and Geek Squad Protection (although it's a good insurance, the store was very forceful about pushing it on customers).  Management also believed in keeping employees after closing hours until ALL departments were clean.  This means that although the department you work in may have been kept clean and organized all day, you could not leave until the entire store was clean.  This was a problem because certain departments slacked off and forced other departments to clean for them - this was an everyday problem that management failed to correct.  The culture can be clique-y due to the ""geek"" persona, but overall most people are friendly."
good,A nice job to have and start out with a business you want to grow as a person. If you are truly invested there is a lot of room to grow as a person and within the company
good,"Entreprise  qui cherchent toujours   maintenir sa position sur le marché au détriment de ces meilleurs éléments."
good,Best Buy is a wonderful place to work. Most management teams are fun and easy to work with but the work to life balance is terrible. No one cares about your personal life they only really search for profit.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it depends on what store you get hired to because that determines your management. Vallejo isn't the best store best buy has to offer.
good,"I took this position in a part-time role at the highest wage they could offer me. Considering the position I held prior, this position was a cake walk and I had the full support of the Best Buy staff provided I gave them all of my energy into their efforts as well. "
good,"It is a wonderful company with a great culture, but the room for advancement is minimum and pay is low considering experience and education. For someone's first time job it would be a great fit"
good,Not a bad job. I liked working at yet but. But the customers and annoying and there is always a a few managers that have no idea how to run a store and make work miserable.
good,"It was an ok place to work. I was 19 years old and worked at the cash register. Most of the emphasis from the mangers was to sell the replacement plans. They required us to ask the customer 3 times if they wanted the replacement plan, even if they said no the first time."
good,"It was ok, I felt like I was under appreciated at best buy because I was one of the top sales men in the company and they didnt treat me like it. It was an ok experience for a retail job"
good,"- lots of walking around"
good,They expect a lot out of you as far as sales / numbers but don't pay anywhere near other sales jobs. Was a great platform for building sales experience however.
good,I was hired on as temp during peak season and the day that peak ended i was let go via voicemail. The work was easy and the pay was good however we didnt have much overtime and the job was over quickly.
good,"I had begun best buy and realy enjoied the work there, my work was fun, easy and enjoiable. I was told after the holiday season i would be kept but when time came they gave me a three week notice of termination."
good,When I first started working at Best Buy I was having a great time. My coworkers were great. As an inventory associate the hardest part of the job was definitely keeping the store stocked and in good condition during the holidays.  After a while management shifted. The new management does't really seem to care about their employees.Fast forward to now and I basically get no hours. I really miss the old Best Buy.
good,"Not a great work environment, needs to improve. Management is not focused on the right tasks. Employees who have been their longer try to make newbies do all the work."
good,"Is a great place to learn how to run a business, if you want to move up in the company. All you need to do is be driven and ask for the opportunities to learn."
good,pass the buck is a standard with long time employees .. leave it to someone else to do. everyday was  new issue with work left undone for me to handle on my shift on top of my normal duties.
good,The work environment was fun but the pay was dismal. Moral is all about the type of managers you have. The hours are long and sometimes very late which makes it hard to see family.
good,"Nice supporting working environment, co worker are supportive and management are great and helpful, have fun why being the best in what you do, while helping the customers"
good,"This was my first experience in a larger corporate environment.  While they had good products for the customers, I felt deeply that they did not compensate fairly for the duties that were asked to be performed.  I was fond of the management staff, but it was a learning experience for me."
good,Best Buy was a fun and friendly place to work. Customers were pleasant and overall was a good place to work. M.anagement needed a bit more training though. Not enough communication between management
good,"This job was fun, but the culture creeped me out.  I was a guy searching for shoplifters, thefts and discrepancies in the store.  Not a great way to make friends.  It's a typically loss prevention job.  Notes, long periods of boring, and few times you feel like your actually stopping crime.  Not for everyone, but an entry level job for those who like to keep people honest."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Geek Squad is a rapidly changing job. I worked in the Secondary Markets department. We saw many different electronic devices on a daily basis. I loved working with the majority of the people there. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on there. and the management team is not exactly private when you tell them your personal business. There is quite a bit of gossiping about others. I left there because of these issues.
good,"Overall, i feel it was a great experience. Since it was my first job, it was really challenging in the beginning, but i was able to cope u with the pressure."
good,"Great way to start off a sales career."
good,This was a seasonal position and very few people work full time apart from the managers. There was a little flexibility in work times but not during the peak times of course. Management was always friendly. The hardest part was the down time between customers during slow days. ( I am a stay-busy type of person though so this may differ for someone else). I enjoyed being able to interact with customers and help them find what they really needed.
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is that you learn something new everyday and being able to make the customer happy about making the right decision that fits their needs. is a great feeling customer is always first.
good,Can definitely be a fun place to work if placed with right management team. Also always an opportunity to grow and learn new things to further development.
good,"I was working for best buy to pay for college. I worked in the geek squad department for 2 years. started as a cashier. When it comes to customers that were yelling at you or upset about something, the managers never had your back. They were trying to get rid of me by saying that i was stealing when they had no proof. just be careful with management"
good,"La gente en corporativo es la mayor beneficiada ya que pueden contar con una vida personal sin problema y bien remunerada, sin embargo la gente de operaciones en cualesquier área de tienda no tiene vida personal (la pierdes al ingresar a trabajar ahí), es la peor pagada de la compañía y a la que más se le exigen resultados (son los más ¨matados¨)."
good,"Good and productive so much things to learn in best buy staff are good polite and helpful and is a good environment to learn, adapt to the situations and learn customer service."
good,never the same when working there .management is lazy and never do any work they are suppose to do. employees have no drive to do better when they see this
good,i travel with my job so a social life is kinda down the drain. its hard to keep up with everything going on and it can get stressful. its not hard work just hard on the body as i work nights and away from all my friends and family. it can get you homesick and its not for everyone.
good,"I had no issues with the management or the job itself, your duties make sense and its your standard fare for retail. So really its normal to have sub par benefits, sub par pay and very little work flexibility."
good,"I've worked for Best Buy for about 3 years in various departments. Let me tell you right now, if your aren't sales floor, the managers don't care about you or your problems unless it causes them a issue. In my experience warehouse positions(Inventory/Merch) will usually always be understaffed or overstaffed with people who couldn't pour water out of a boot if the instructions were on the heel. With the fact that in the last 2 years Best Buy has cut Anderson Media Merchandising, and now Solar Project Team you would think that they would give a slight pay increase to the warehouse employees for taking on those new tasks. No didn't happen, Myself and 3 other co-workers are responsible for multitasking at least 2 different job positions all week but not allowed to go into overtime. You will be stuck babysitting new hires till they quit or get fired for stealing because thats what happens 80 percent of the time. Sales floor will stick products back in the wrong spot on the shelf and then blame you when it rings up as the wrong price, sales floor also likes to not bother to read UPC codes when grabbing computers, tablets, and other items down from topstock or lock up. Give the customers usually a more expensive product then the one they were purchasing and then discount that item down or sku sell it which cause erosion or missing product in the inventory. That is also your fault. Broken TV, your fault. One random item not downstocked in the morning while 6 sales floor people stand around at the front of the store on their cellphones? Your fault."
good,So I worked at BestBuy for a little less that 7 years and it was not really the place i would go for a career but it was an overall nice place to work. the break room was nicely set up with a big flat screen tv and there was always somewhere to sit. As far as anything else goes i would not want to end up working there again.
good,"Most of the time , the work is fun and the people you work with are nice but the management team can't do most of their job properly and there's place to injustice"
good,"We typically work over night and preform remodels, small area transformations, store closings, and relocations of stores. We are in charge of coordinating multiple groups of people, our team of 6, fixture contractors, electricians, and flooring crew. In a night and working with all teams we move product and fixtures around to mapped locations and have the store ready to be up and running the next day. Sometimes its hard to retain people because of the night work or travel but its also fun to see new places and not do the same thing ever day or week."
good,"It is a good place to work, environment is fast-paced and expectations high. Positions are stable and long-lasting (when permanent) Definitely challenging!"
good,"- Learned a lot about computer hardware and software."
good,"Typical day at work is arrive; receive shipments, send out product with Canada Post, and do LP (stands for loss prevention but that title is basically greeter bc we're not allowed to look at the camera's anymore, which doesn't actually stop most of us from looking) for anywhere between 45mins-5hours (of grueling back pain if you have no one to switch off with regularly). Also responsible to either open or close the store. Part Timers are not guaranteed hours especially if you are not a manager or supervisors favourite. Co-workers are usually quite knowledgeable in their area after a few months of working and you can rely on them to help you unless is busy like christmas time. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is a fun place, must learn how to use and sell the products on your own. The pay is very little and you do a lot of hours and a lot of physical work"
good,This was the introduction to Best Buy Canada. So the expectations were very high and the promotion helped launched BB into the national Canadian market.
good,"Good place just needs more discipline and structure in the mission of the company. Also it needs to make sure the hierarchy has checks and balances on the say so's at the store level ensuring no breaches in the line of command going down. So that employees are protected form supervisors, supervisors from managers, especially on each individuals belief about how each operation should or could be run."
good,"Good place to work but not a career since even as a member of management salary isn't well.  Best part of the job however is learning different aspects of the store such as customer service desk, computers, and mobile services."
good,"Pros:"
good,"While not the best job I've had, it is also far from the worst. Good variety of work to do, recognition of outstanding employees, a nice employee discount, good pay, and a generally good work environment. The hardest part of the job was probably either during Black Friday, or when ""the great turnover"" happened and many long-time employees quit all around the same time, causing under-staffing in virtually every department and much smaller teams having to do more work. Co-workers were great and I made many friends. Management has been more typically good than bad. Overall, I feel that Best Buy is good to its employees and is a fine place to work for. The most enjoyable parts of the job were events (such as when I got to meet Alice in Chains and get them to sign an album) and getting to use the discount."
good,fun employer buy its a dead end job. You only get somewhere if you know someone.  Geek Squad as a whole is very cool. I learned a lot there
good,It's a place where there is always work from small to big and that there is a time limit of what work is being completed. I learned to adapt to calm and harsh situations and to always keep calm and aware of what's going on. Management is decent but could always use improvement. The co-workers keep an eye on rewards and is usually friendly to everyone. The hardest part of the job is when a customer begins to aggravate me for simply not listening or using aggression against me. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I successfully help customers in need.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with this company, however I wish that I had moved up already at this point. I do not feel that my efforts of being a hard worker is being recognized. However, it has at least been a stable job and the people I work with are pleasant to work with."
good,Fun workplace. You can meet a lot of nice people and the management is overall down to earth. Customer service is quite good and everyone is always attempting to help customers to the best of their ability. During busy times it's quite crazy so there are a minimum amount of people on the floor since the stores are usually packed.
good,"typical days at work were busy in customer service. Some of the managers were nice and fun to work with and very helpful where others were rude. Got along well with many of my coworkers but there are always a few that I didn't. Hardest part sometimes was dealing with customers that were screaming at you but the nice, considerate and understanding people truly make up for it"
good,"Great place to learn to deal with customers ranging from nice to spitting at you because of how much they are yelling. I am an MCSA, which is the best out of 3 past positions within Best Buy for gaining work experience. From creating and fixing orders, to jumping over to customer service once your phones have finally stopped ringing and dealing with people in person, it's all just a bunch of learning to deal with stress! I personally try to lead as much as possible, because even when managers are around, some of them just say you need to be able to deal with it.. even though you are not compensated in the same way they are, and they are standing there doing nothing. My co-workers aren't too bad, a few of them can turn an annoyed customer into a mad one in an instant, and the others just call for me the second they may have to say no to a return even though its been 3 years since they bought it. Hardest part is how I feel like I have no backup except for a few random co-workers. And the 1 on 1's they have aren't personal at all, so you feel as though they don't really care about you. Just what you can do for them. The most enjoyable part is after a while of throwing yourself in hard situations, you learn quickly about the ins/outs and workarounds. Not to screw Best Buy or anything, but just to know how the system works and be able to fix things if they go awry, and to have the customer leave happy if at all possible."
good,It is a good place to start off at to learn knew things and to take with you into business world on management and selling skills.
good,the mangers are always working on only one person its not fair the customers are rude and the hours not so great the discount is good
good,"Overall the company is a great place to be employed. However, management within the mobile stores in District 522(Carolina,Flor.etc) are corrupt including the district manager."
good,"It was a good job , but management is very horrible and non professional. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers and their attitude."
good,"All in all not a bad place to work at. I worked in the computer department and i didnt know much when i started but was slowly being taught. Witch is why the hardest part of working there is having to sell a certain amount everyday, even in slow days."
good,"Working for Best Buy is like working for any other retail store.  The work is the same everyday, with little changes taking place.  I work in the warehouse as an inventory specialist.  My main tasks are shipping and receiving, and helping the sales staff with any inventory problems.  The hardest part of my job is multi-tasking, as most times there is only one person scheduled in the warehouse each shift.  There seems to always be problems with the labor allocation at our store, which makes it difficult to meet our goals while maintaining a comfortable environment.  Management has been steadily implementing productive changes that seem to be moving the company in the right direction.  For the most part, my co-workers are good people that care about meeting the company goals and helping customers."
good,Best Buy has came along since I started. The environment is nice. Managers are more helpful. Staffing is always low which puts a strain on employees and leaves customers waiting.
good,Good company.  They look out for their valuable employees.  However they were a bit cut throat when I was there years ago.  I believe that they had a downturn and are now much better to their employees but it has been years.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Lots of turn over with the part time positions, pay is equal to businesses of this type below average."
good,Best Buy was a very fun oriented place. The hassle of making people get credit cards was a little overwhelming. over all the managers would have many disagreements that would conflict with the asssociates.
good,"The company places a premium on defining experiences.  It can be an incredibly exciting place to work, especially during the holidays.  The focus on values, people and experiences were a critical part of what made it a great company to work for."
good,"Fun place to work great people , staff, management, Just wish is wasn't seasonal and paid better. Great experience though"
good,Each day we have to clok in at time because if we didn't we get points and we can get layoff. I have to learn the codes for replaced my own product because in the rush the fork lift drivers where doingh  their job.
good,"I learned how to pack, sort, bundle and do .com stuff the hardest part of the job was the breaks were really weird. You would get a break within half an hour of starting work which I didnt like and if you did work later you were lucky if you even had another break"
good,"For the most part, Best buy was a good company. I was just a seasonal worker so I was not there for very long. I was a customer service agent so I did returns, help order things for the customer, answer phones and much more. Management was great, I had a great manager very friendly and new the procedures very well. My Co-workers were equally great was well."
good,"Geeksquad has been a fun but exhausting place to work, the workload is literally non stop and we are always under labor. There are no Pauses and you have to know your computers well for diagnosis purposes."
good,I started working at Best Buy in the 10th grade as a cashier and i did understand that positions tends to be repetitive while none of the associates really bother to communicate with you unless they need the traps taken back to the warehouse. So i applied for MCSA only to come to a team of lazy people had me do the multi channel responsibilities when they didn't want to. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a chance to help out on the sales floor.
good,"This is a huge company that is forward-thinking and has good, positive management.  Problem is, they don't pay anything."
good,"learned a lot from any new technology at the market, its easy fun and working with diversity make more easy to sale to new people to the town."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of having everything ready for ""opening up shop"", and that more or less consisted of a mindset more so than anything tangible. I worked at the Customer Service desk, so I had to be poised to expect any disgruntled or unruly customers at a moment's notice. I learned to multi-task efficiently during this time, meanwhile channeling my patience. I had to accept working by myself when someone disappeared, so it helped me become independent in a sense. Some management will be there to have your back, and some will just be bodies that are nowhere to be seen. It really depends on the store, but from my experience, out of the six or seven managers, about three or four helped out diligently. My co-workers, on the other hand, are very helpful. They will usually make or break your experience at a retail establishment. My co-workers come together and understand how to take care of business efficiently, which made for better operations."
good,"Best Buy used to be a place where I didn't mind going to work every day. Now, I just want to get out. The company doesn't look out for their employees, no one is on the same page, and training isn't really training. They don't teach. Although e-learnings are there for teaching, managers and supervisors should teach their employees on top of that. No one knows anything about what the GSP covers!"
good,Loved everyone that worked with me except upper management. The pay was bad and was hard to get raises after I was there for a year or 2.
good,"Working at Best buy was a very good learning experience. My job there was MCSA( Administrative assistant) also customer service representative. A typical day I would be answering phone calls, answering questions, helping different departments figure out complicated problems, file paper work, and do returns on items. I learned a lot about time management and being very organized. Management there was o.k., but very nice and respectable people. My co workers were students in high school to adult. Very different personalities leading to drama with in the work environment. The hardest part of my job would be having not get to overwhelmed with the customers calling me names for something I couldn't control. The most enjoyable part would be knowing how to do my job so well and getting enjoyment out of it."
good,A fun place to work for the technology but HORRIBLE for a personal life! NO weekends off and most nights had to close as upper management would leave. A great team who worked beyond what they should!
good,Good place to work at if your in high school or going to college. Employees get great discounts and good training before starting.
good,challenging work with a group of dedicated knowledgeable techies.  Every day involved high level projects from payroll/hr conversions to new input scripts and error patching.  The company grew faster than it's ability to manage such a large group. there was a tendency to treat non management employment as expendable.  this waned employee loyalty.
good,best buy is an ok place to work at. new management changes the culture. very hard to advance and very unfair pay. some managers will micro-manage.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,good place to work always something going on to keep you busy. Long hours sometimes and always would want to ensure that customers where satisfied
good,"decent work place, fun environment, all about numbers. Sales is a must with this job even if it's a return, based off of bonuses."
good,"My store is considered a ""community"" store so it is atypical of Geek Squad positions. They have all of the agents do every part of the work: Customer facing and sales, Computer repair, answering phones, shipping and receiving. This caused undo stress because there were people who specialized in certain areas and would refuse to do their part in others. For the majority of my tenure management has been decent but recently a regime change has caused issues. They new GM considers sales the most important aspect of Best Buy and will sacrifice in all other facets to bolsters his focus. Hiring is also very slow which resulted in under-staffing issues. Still one of the best jobs I've ever had don't get my wrong."
good,"It was a good position for me to start in this industry, but the pay was not good.  The management, benefits, advancement and job security was okay."
good,"Great place to work if you love technology. Coworkers are great, some of the managers are supportive. The rest of them don't really care about you as an employee or the customers (don't know how to listen). CEO tries really hard to build a comfortable and enjoyable culture which you feel a part of, again, with the right store managers. Great benefits including healthcare, 401k, PTO, and store discounts."
good,A fun environment to work in but you can't really plan your life because there is never a set schedule. You're pretty much guaranteed to work weekends and all throughout the holidays.
good,"Learned a lot of techniques to repair computers in the software and hardware department, good start for computer repair career"
good,"Best Buy is an excellent first job that can provide great benefits, having said that, this is not the company for building careers or employee development. Best Buy constantly changes their operating model in order to meet the ever changing needs and wants of the modern customer. This causes positions to be eliminated and reduces opportunities for growth. Having worked for this company nearly a decade I have seen great employees and company assets leave the company for this very reason. You will find many a manager displaced working supervisor and lead spots taking away and full timer dreams of advancement. While I have obtained a wealth of business acumen and have genuinely enjoyed my time with the company, it is apparent that I must move on and broaden my field of experience and opportunity. I will be leaving on good terms with support and encouragement from my manager and know if ever in need of employment my Best Buy network will help me."
good,Good company to work for if you like electronics.  Values driven organization that caters to the employee experience.  Discount is good but the pay is a bit off versus other retailers.
good,"Prepare, Open, Ask Questions, Demonstrate, Close and Thank each and every customer for their business.  This included me staying current with all the benefits of new and changing technology to better meet the customers needs."
good,Great learning environment. Great team effort and spirit. Learned a lot about the electronic retail sales.  Was accepted to the management training program.
good,long days but worth the experience. The benefits were good and bonus included just not a place to retire. All about numbers and production. Your numbers determine who gets a promotion
good,"Best buy an interesting place to work at, you learn a bunch of new things such as skills like social skills etc. The hardest part in the job was trying to sell the insurance, it was a requirement to sell a certain amount each day and getting customers to buy them was difficult since people just want to pay for their product and leave."
good,"Best buy is a good place to work while going to college.  There are some long term careers paths that can be enjoyable and worth while if they can be attained.  Unfortunately the Best Buy I worked at operated much like a high school popularity contest.  If you are fine with brown nosing, the friend system and working people from 16-22 years of age this is the place for you!"
good,This was always a part time employment opportunity for myself while I was enrolled in school for Bachelor's and Master's Degree.
good,A typical day at work with me working for Best Buy was very interesting. I learned a lot about different products and i met many different customers. The management was solid and my coworkers were all friendly. I can't say their was any hard part of the job but the most enjoyable part to me was working with good people and having the opportunity.
good,"The culture for Best Buy in Madison, MS has taken a turn away from employee and customer satisfaction to a culture of only numbers.  With employee, customer, and client satisfaction, a business cannot operate effectively - rendering a focus on numbers void."
good,"Like many companies management is always the issue. Best Buy has made a lot of changes in the past and has cut back jobs. Management always scatter daily to get things but fail due to poor planning and poor execution.. "
good,"Pros "
good,"fun, wacky, and dreadful. don't take it too serious and don't take it for granted. I would go back great environment. as management be ready to be abused I once worked 21 days straight at 12 hour days."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I come into work look up my paper work and print of my daily tasks and next start working my list for the day. The company is very interesting at the end of the I filed my paper and complete a daily task sheet saying what products that was missing and the ones I had to order for that store.
good,"Work ours are flexible"
good,"Great company, good work life balance, willing to work with your schedule. Training is always available. The only cons is little hours."
good,"This could have been a great job if the managers at my store hadn't been horrible. The employee discount is amazing, and the benefits and pay were good for me. Just my managers caused me to leave because of how unfairly I was treated."
good,"Typical day starts with you clocking in and making sure all products are on and working properly. Next thing is ti make sure pricing for the day is correct on products that have been adjusted. We then have a morning meeting and open the store to the hordes of customers waiting to get in. I greet customers and ask them if they have any questions or need any information. I explain to them the nuances of any item they are interested in and also any products that can enhance the features of the item. Once customer is fully informed of the product and any other items I leave tell them I wil be in the area if they need any help or have further questions. I do this to let them mull things over and not come off overbearing. Once customer is ready I lead them to the cash register and end transaction. I also try to get them to open up an account with a Best Buy credit card. If there is downtime I go to the warehouse and help with shipping and receiving. Once that is over I may do some inventory work and try to find out if any items are missing and try to track them down to prevent shrink. Also worked in Geek Squad helping to recover data, remove adware, spyware, and malware, and print up tickets to fix items such as phones, tablets, and TV's."
good,"Management at my location acted like spoiled entitled children, when I discussed issues about the store I was not listened to. I was trying to save the store money and told all managers about the issues with no one wanting to correct the deficiencies, they all wanted to point the finger at some one else to do the job. I quit, as there is no use talking to a wall."
good,It was fun and co-workers were fantastic. Very helpful when personal issues popped up and got in the way of work. Management was super helpful and understanding.
good,"This was my first job out of the military and my hard work showed. It seemed as though most of the people worked only hard enough not to get fired, and even then, their laziness was over looked since they were friends with leadership. It was not a good environment to be a part of if you're looking for efficiency and cohesiveness."
good,"Love the company. Not much room to advance in store, tons of spots in remote and repair locations or corp. Sadly pay is retail pay and same for hours. Schedules change weekly."
good,"A decent place to work if you do not mind being underpaid. Like all management they try and shorten hours as business declines, and expects you to jump on the stick whenever they need you"
good,"Management is not very well-put. However, the vibe you get from other workers there are awesome and inviting. The ambiance is pleasant."
good,learned about everything you need to know about the electronics you surround yourself and use on a day to day basis.  All about the bottom line and don't tend to care about you on a personal level.
good,Showed to much favoritism and certain employers were disrespectful especially in front of customers. Also the lack of drug testing I would say check your staff twice if not more.
good,"If you're looking for your first job, i would recommend best buy. Often they work around your schedule as long as you tell them some time ahead. Can not say much if you're looking at best buy for a career, While they do offer raises, promotions seemed harder to achieve, often the person next in line for a position is left waiting cause the person currently holding the position cant get one."
good,"Pay is terrible for a person with a life, plain & simple. Make the company 80k a month individually but I take home a quarter of that a year."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you are going to school. Tuition reimbursement was a great benefit. If you like technology and media its great place to work with like minded people and make some great friends.
good,"actually worked as a sub contracter for Best Buy."
good,I worked here before the restructure that merged Customer Service with Geek Squad and it was a great place to work.  After the department merger the job quality and quality of the my co-workers instantly dropped.
good,I've learned a lot from my fellow agents. I have a passion for troubleshooting and changing minds and hearts about technology.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of selling computers, televisions, sell phones, and customer service. I learned a ton of information about all of the items listed above, well enough to sell them and really make each product shine. Management was very laid back, easy going, and great for a laugh. Although, management did not take their jobs as seriously as one should to really succeed in a business. My co-workers didn't have much of a care in the world, what mattered to them was a paycheck. Their work ethic was not the best aside from a select few. Outside of work ethic, most of them were very enjoyable people to work with and were amazing in their own way. The hardest part of my job was trying to calm down extremely irate customers. A lot of the time, no matter if you fix the issue in a sincere fashion or not, they continue to scream in your face and are very rude, especially around the holidays; but this is every sales environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers, co-workers, and managers. I love being surrounding by fun loving people and I absolutely love teaching people new things. When a customer came into the store not knowing a thing about what they were buying, by the time they walked out they knew a bit about the product and how to function it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I enjoyed my team and my direct supervisor, beyond that there was a lot of mandatory overtime. No compassion for working parents or flexibility or understanding when not making it to work due to illness"
good,"Typical days at work can consist of large sales summing $3,500 and up.  Answering a lot of different client questions, and multitasking must be second nature.  Learned a lot about new technology as far as Home theater equipment is concerned. Scratching the surface as much as possible when speaking of audio, I was allowed to speak about music daily while discussing sound with potential clients.  Most of my leaders were very understanding and pushed all of us to do better each day.  Co workers also understood that it was a team atmosphere and were always willing to assist in problem solving.  Most difficulities came while assisting clients with difficult requests or solutions, however each problem was met head on and dealt with in a timely fashipon.  I did truly get to enjoy assisting clients in the purchase of products and being knowledge enough to have an answer for them as well as be open minded to new things they may have to share with me."
good,"Typical day i am running CAT5E wires through the ceiling and checking any technical issues throughout the store. Updating cash registers. Running Coax cable."
good,"Loss Prevention was Awesome when you could stop shoplifting. They changed the everything and made Asset Protection stay at the doors checking receipts them blame you when theft is high in your store."
good,I started out doing seasonal as a cashier but soon after was offered an position in the home theater department. Soon after I took the job I had to leave to tent to family matters. Over all was an good experience !!
good,I arrive at work and log into our workplace site to clock in.After that I download my schedule for the day and call my clients to give them expectant arrival times.If I have a job that requires 2 people I seen a group email out to my team and will receive help via this process.We have a great team.The hardest part of my job is disappointing client when it requires me to order parts.The most enjoyable part is when my repair resolves the issue.
good,"In GeekSquad you really do learn quite a bit about troubleshooting issues. The only problem is that, for Consultation Agents at least, it's still a retail position and you will be pressured to sell as many services as possible.Don't go into this position thinking you'll be fixing computers all day (only Advanced Repair Agents do that)."
good,"Daily operations of elc"
good,"By the end of my time at Best Buy, I had worked there for a little over 2 years. My reason for leaving Best Buy was because I got accepted into school that was 8 hours a day Monday through Friday. Best Buy was a good place to work, I met a lot of great people who have become good friends of mine, it was easy to manage while I was still in high school, and there was a lot of opportunity for advancement. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to becoming Operations Senior towards the end of my time - and had experienced different departments in between then. Overall, I did enjoy working there and made a decent amount of money for what I was doing and would recommend it to any person that is in the position I was in at the time."
good,its so unstable and filled with a bunch of managers that aren't knowledgeable about that company and how it runs. It's a lot I can say about this company that are negative but I'm not going to go into all that detail. I will say this there are two managers that work so hard and never get any acknowledgement. The co-workers are friendly and will make you feel comfortable. The job isn't hard and I quickly got the hang out it.
good,"This company is in ruins, at least here in Boston. I would stay away if your looking for a job and dont want to worry when your store is going to close."
good,"-Management will either like or dislike you"
good,"Helping out customers finding where product is and what I can do to make the experience better for them. I learned more about computers, gaming systems , how to do returns and how to full fill a customers needs. I have trained in lots of people. I have a great bound with my co-works I get along with everyone I never have problems. The hardest part of my job was not getting enough hours and the most enjoyable part of my job was making all my customers happy and making them want to come back and feel welcomed."
good,There were no typical days at Best Buy which is one thing I enjoyed about this position. Working with a diverse group of employees and customers on all different types of projects/programs from small product and install projects to 60M dollar gift card programs.
good,my day is filled with training of the sales associates in my department and leading the department consistently in all sales metric.
good,"I enjoyed this work, the public was always happy after a visit from me and my team."
good,"Typical day at work"
good,Temp job served its purpose not enough hours or pay unorganized
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It's a seasonal position, In the beginning it was busy and know it's slow. They are cutting hours. I learned how to work from work. Don't know anyone but from chat room and sometimes the chat coaches are annoyed you can sense it in the way they type when you ask them a question. It sometimes over 90 people in one chat room."
good,"While the sales training is good, the hours and benefits are not the most suitable. Lower end promotions come with greater responsibility, extremely high hours with no extra benefits or increased pay."
good,"Get to work and answer calls, sell over the phone as well as do all in store pickups."
good,alright job. asked for a lot. moved employees from department to department even if they didnt know anything about a product.
good,"I enjoy most all journeys I embark on and my experience with the Samsung experience store's within Best Buys footprints were no exception. It is important to note that Mosaic (my employer for this position) was in new territory for this job, which means that some hiccups in the managerial processes were expected. During my time with the company I witnessed the changeover of no less than 16 employees, who never disobeyed any company policies! How you ask? Well the position was unconventional in the sense that we all worked for Mosaic, but was sometimes micromanaged by Best Buy whom we were not even employed by. On many occasions I was challenged with discrepancies between my duties and my ability to co exist with Best Buy. To Co exist is usually something I could manage with ease, however sometimes we were tasked to sell competing products which would frustrate best buy staff (like Samsung phone cases as opposed to best buy phone cases) as well as competing services. In many situations I realized that the structure of my position was still a work in progress and sometimes you have to ""be"" the experiment in order for a company to grow. Overall I would look at the silver lining and say I tremendously increased my ability to communicate and win the trust of other people, which was a skill I already excelled at. I ultimately ended up getting laid off because of a changeover in staff at my location but could go back to the company at any time, although i'm not so sure that would be a desire of mine at this point."
good,My co-workers were amazing we created our own little family. But trying to grow with in the company is very challenging they often hired people from outside the company for advanced positions or transferred people from different stores.
good,"Best Buy is a pretty good company to work for.  The line level associates enjoy above average pay for the industry, selling interesting product, decent training program, and a pretty aggressive employee discount.  However, with all the recent changes within the company there has been a mass exodus of very talented employees so the knowledge bench has been degraded extensively.  Also, the leadership structure has been changed to the point where it is difficult to get support because people are stretched too thin.  Overall, it is a good place to work, but can be stressful and holiday hours are a grind."
good,"Great company, I love the culture.  It really becomes a part of you.  For some that can be a bad thing, for others it can be amazing."
good,its always a good vibe but the managers where not doing there jobs right. they never gave you hours they would only give you at least 4 hour
good,Okay place to start working. It serves as a solid start-up in the working field. But it is not a sustainable place to build a true career.
good,"Lots of ambiguity with projects, which means you have the luxury of creating processes, improving processes and working with lots of talented people that you may not otherwise get to know."
good,"Standard sales goals"
good,"Layoffs are normal-- the term ""Termination Tuesday"" used to apply, but now under new management it can happen any day of the week and it doesn't matter who you are or what your Performance Review said.  It can come down to money and/or if you know or don't know the right people in your division.  Some of the better employees get let go because they don't go out to happy hour with the right people-- think 5 year recess games."
good,Typical. Not much else to say. Electronics are fun to sell. Kind of neutral. But otherwise it is typical. I buy all my stuff of Amazon anyways.
good,"In my opinion. If wanting to get into retail, BBYM is a great business to get involved with. Separate processes will allow you to work in a single zone instead of working in zones you are not comfortable in."
good,a lot of standing. pay was decent. flexible work schedule. good working environment where you can learn a lot. dead end job no chance for promotion
good,A typical day included keeping the stores stocked and maintained customer satisfaction. I learned a lot about retail customer service and what it takes to keep the customer happy. Teamwork and communication with management is a big factor to complete daily goals set forth the previous night. Diversity is embraced and I enjoyed working with my fellow team members.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Best Buy. I am very electronic savvy. With this being said, I was only part time and needed to leave for a full time job elsewhere."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Being able to communicate with people everyday made the day fun. Knowing that I was responsible for the merchandise made me feel needed. I've learned that there are a lot of people out there that will do bad things for a small price.
good,Went through 2 organizational changes.  Co-workers were great to work with.  Managers were never on the same page so it kind of made the business ineffectively.
good,hours tend to get cut if there's not enough labor.  low pay.  not enough growth.
good,"A typical day at work involved setting up and improving several computers at a time while helping customers that bring their computers in for repair or troubleshooting. I learned how to be very patient with people that may not be as proficient or knowledgeable in a particular area. The upper management were all extremely friendly and nice, while the lower management seemed to have acquired their positions only because of the length of time they had worked at the location. The hardest part of my job was the pressure to sell products to customers that were not necessary in order to meet certain quotas set by the lower management in order to help them obtain certain bonuses. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to work with the newest and greatest technology each and every day at work."
good,It was a fun environment for a part time position. The experience I gained dealing with customers really helped a lot.
good,Managers only cared about what the employee could do for them. Payroll/HR took over 4 months to get my bonus pay right.
good,"Relaxed days at work. Learned a great deal about delivering quality service to customers and providing adequate recommendations. Interface with management could be better however coworkers established a friendly environment. I enjoyed the customer feedback and loyalty. Also, the discounts offered was extraordinary. Downfalls consisted of getting help from managers when dealing with agitated employees."
good,"middle management only does what is fed to them from higher up, main problem with bestbuy, every month a different strategy is put in place. Management needs to listen to low level employees more."
good,working at best buy can improve on how you sale computers. I learned how to get more personal with customers.
good,"You work with customers all day sellings electronics and services."
good,"On a typical day I would come in and run the department, check numbers and coach and train with my supervisor. I would pair up employees with customers, and help with closing sales. Through all my time at Best Buy I have learned many valuable things such as problem solving, maintaining departments to its standards, and learned how to teach out materials and perform off those teachings. Unfortunately upper management is poor. I receive no additional coaching and training, and rarely get any materials in regards to my progression at Best Buy. My district staff is almost non-existant. I might see my district staff memeber once every few months, and at that point its to threaten me about my job. Either do better or become a customer... finishing second in the district for the year apparently gets no recognition. The upper management would be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diverse group of employees we have working here. They are all great people."
good,Great job for somebody just starting out I did enjoy it but with all the company reconstructions with people losing jobs morale has gone down
good,"It's sales so your hours pretty much comes from how well you can sell products, warranties and pretty much yourself."
good,Operation of the business does not take priority over secondary tasks
good,"Work day begins at 0530 and was unknown how long work day would be until after start up at 0530. I liked the job in general, but was very inconsistant."
good,"Working at Best Buy, especially during the holiday season is a growing experience for sure. For those young talent who need to get by, there are few solid ""careers"" at Best Buy."
good,The life of a best buy employee isn't hard its honestly not but it is taxing on your personal life. I'm not saying that it consumes your life but it tries too. The management depending on your store is pretty understanding not to pushy or demanding. They do have their favorites and such is to be expected from any management. Its pretty average but the there are so many rules maybe too many rules but its retail so its not a deal breaker but again taxing on ones self interest in the company. But being in retail you meet so many depressing people in the company but you do find a few that are all around great co workers its been fun no regrets
good,They are really good with training. You get to really know the products which makes it easier to sell them. Big store a lot of socializing.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find what they were looking for. Was thrown in the job with no training and was required to learn everything on my own. Very disorganized.
good,I dislike my current situation. I feel under paid. I feel management has a lot of favoritism. Its just not where I want to be
good,"Unfair"
good,great high school. just my location has pretty bad management
good,"While I am at work,  I do everything I am able to make sure the customers are happy when they leave the building."
good,"You are jumping into a fast paced day to day lifestyle. You will learn about yourself and your abilities to multi-task and selling strategies. "
good,very exciting work environment with many chances to advance and be part of the best buy management
good,"Working at Best Buy is not something that I would consider a dream job but it will teach you how to be patient and how to handle irate customers. Although there aren't many great things to say about Best Buy, there aren't many bad things to say about Best Buy either. This job is going to be exactly what you are willing to make it. If you put the time and effort in to move up in the company, there are definitely opportunities. If you don't have any aspirations of moving up in the company, you will forever remain bottom tier."
good,"I have worked for Best Buy since 2006. Began as a line level moved up to management. I hear it depends on the store worked at but other management was unfair with employees. "
good,great place to work if work life balance is not important for you. The work life balance for management is almost nonexistent.
good,Very fun and friendly environment to work in. The training could have been much better. They just stick you in front of a computer and you go through outdated power points that don't contain up to date information. Direct manager were awesome. GM was very condescending at times.
good,was a good company to work for when they gave you the hours to work
good,"Assist customers and provided helpful insight toward the desire products.  Beside learning new advance technologies, I also learn how to deal with various personalities.  To be able to identified the lines of am here to Help and still maintain department goal in products, accessories and Service agreements sold are a challenge within."
good,"Flexible hours, management can be bad depending on who the GM is, almost no room for advancement, good if you're looking for a part time job, but overall an ok job."
good,I started by working in the Geek Squad department where I helped to repair and program computers.  I moved laterally to a position in the automotive install bay where I became certified to install audio and security components to vehicles.
good,"stressful day full of work, busy all year, great challenges."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work... if you are student looking for a part time job. Typical of retail stores, they only care about how much they make and not the employee."
good,Loved helping customers and working with so many employees by coaching and training all staff members.
good,"The job wasn't too bad, but dealing with the drama was. It's like being in high school again."
good,"When it comes to scheduling they are quite flexible, but my location made it quite difficult to advance overall . The pay was very unfair as to older employees making less than those hired fresh. The only good benefits were those available to managers, supervisors, etc. It's a good starting job, but not something you could stay with longer than a year without feeling abused. They give you a chance to expand your knowledge in the store, but don't compensate you for it."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy has its perks towards employees, but growth is primarily based on favoritism not capability.  The pay is competitive for a retail environment.  However,if you are considering a high level position, you have to network with the management to get noticed.  The only other way to get promoted would be time based."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of unloading trucks, processing customers orders, gather packages for online customers, stock shelves, load and unload heavy merchandise from customer vehicles."
good,"The company expects you to go above and beyond, while they pay you minimum dollar for it."
good,A good place to work right out of high school or college.  The pay is decent and the co-workers are usually good people.
good,"My current work at Best Buy requires that I spend time with clients working to check their computers in and basic repairs.  My favorite part of the job is the people I meet.  I get the opportunity to spend time with fantastic individuals that I create long-term relationships with.  That being said, the pay vs. the work is heavily skewed, managers have very high expectations, you are given very little time to work through what you must, etc.  The hardest part of the job is seeing a client in need, and having no resolution for them."
good,"there's a lot of times Best Buy can be fun to work at, if your younger, you tend to work with people your age. as long as you have a good manager the job is a good one, but ive also had bad managers while working at best buy who can make you hate having to come to work every day."
good,Best Buy can be a very exciting place to work.  They spend a great deal of time and money training you and ensuring that you live up to your full potential.  Best Buy focuses on the customers who are the main part of the job and working with people all day can be both enjoyable and difficult.  The hours you work at Best Buy can be the biggest downside to this job.  It is almost mandatory for most employees to work holidays and weekends but the people you work with make it worthwhile.
good,"I loved working with my department. We all clicked, knew each other's strengths and weaknesses, and did a bang up job. Management at times was a little difficult to deal with, they would become over bearing and would have their selected favorites. I learned a lot about retail, sales, how to be a leader, and how to interact with a diverse group of people. Overall, the experience was a good one."
good,Answered all incoming calls for the store answering everything I possibly can. As well as fulfilling online orders for customers in store. The job got quite overwhelming at times while trying to be on the phone and talking to someone in store but I managed to do a great job.
good,learning all the products and new things in technolgy. staff that willing to bond as a team and sell.pratcing on becoming a better salesman. hard part was stubborn customers or irate customers that are cofused on what they bought.
good,They don't make a very big effort to keep you around if you aren't a competing salesperson.
good,"This job provides great training to someone who is not tech savvy, I learned a lot about computers and technology"
good,"included working very hard to satisfy customers, not much team effort."
good,"Fun store to work at if you have the right management. Probably the worst place on the planet to work with the wrong management. I worked in 6 stores over the course of 4 years because the only way to move up is to switch stores when they have an opening. At every location the management are elitist they believe there one and only job is to manage the people there. They rarely helped customers, they never took calls (they had people for that) and asking for help while they stand in the middle of the sales floor was a big no no. The regular staff on the other hand are all usually very close and its not uncommon to have a party or two with nearly everyone there. The job itself was never over the top demanding even during the peak of the recession employees weren't asked to do to much."
good,"I would go in, clock in and typically just help customers that needed help. I worked in portable electronics so i knew all about gaming & camera's."
good,"I greet customer that come into my department, I work in the computer department.  I learn how to deal with many different customer and handle stressed angry customer in person. Management is good but can be improved upon when it comes to driving number. not so stressful on the employee that work as hard as they can to get the results vs the one that are their just for a pay. Let us switch department when we like to try something new and learn new skills and other areas of the business. "
good,Sold to government and schools electronics in bulk. Closed as it was commission sales in a non commission world.
good,"It's a retail job, nothing special. decent pay, stereotypical bosses."
good,Focused mostly on sales versus providing best support. Management varied but for the most part needed work.
good,"As soon as you clock in you are on the floor approaching customers asking if they need any help, it's your job to stay with your costumer till the end of the transaction. Everyone's job detail is different depending on the department but having a general knowledge of everything in the store is a good idea. We had to sell at least one Best Buy credit card every week. I barely retained anything I learned because of how it was forced down my throat while being a full-time student. I love almost all my co-workers and the upper management but when I moved to the front my manager changed and the whole dynamic of the job changed. The hardest part was trying to define a flexible schedule with my manager because I had school and sports alongside the job. The best part of the job was probably the pay. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"little training, little leadership, never clear expectations. "
good,"As a part time associate it can be confusing as to the actual goals of the business as it can change day to day. As full time associate one is strongly encouraged to coach part time associates at times generate schedules as well as know shrink levels daily/weekly/monthly profit and loss of the dept, etc."
good,I would have liked more stability in the company. Its a good part time job. i would not try to make it a career.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work. The coworkers are wonderful people who when working together can be an amazing team. On a daily bases customers can be mean and ungrateful no matter how you try to please everyone you will go insane but that's a day in retail no one is ever happy.
good,"My experience at Best Buy is unlike the majority of other employees due to the fact I work in the busiest location in the country.  A lot of the job entails coaching and training employees on selling skills that company has provided training to their leadership on.  I've learned how to analyze my business through metrics, scorecards and then implement behaviors to course correct financial opportunities.  The job is fun many of times, but there are longer hours and a lot of time with family is sacrificed to try and move up through the company.   "
good,Its a good place to work but customer can get very demanding. 
good,"This was a part time job while going to college.  Not much differentiates it from other retail positions.  There is continual turnover of staff and a heavy dependence on keeping supervisors / managers happy with good numbers via accessory and service plan attachments to sales."
good,"Overall, an enjoyable place to work but one clear area that Best Buy lacked in was Job Security and broken promises. I was considered by my supervisor Nishant as an ""asset to the team"" at one point, only to be let go two months later because the Best Buy was laying off. I am sure the company had to make difficult decisions to make regarding the employees. It just would have been nice if they had given me more of a forewarning."
good,Good place to learn more about sales and electronic repairs.
good,"Management focused mainly on numbers and not employees, felt like I was conning people into buying unnecessary services."
good,"Always busy, clocked in early to help, fast people to work with. Learned how to be fast, work more on multitasking, keeping your stress down when it got busy and interact with customer when they wanted their order already and keeping them calm. Being quick on the system and great team work. Fun to work with got things done quick by communicating, and having things the right way. The hardest part was when needed the day off for appointment there was no one to cover your shift and also little by little they where cutting days off and also they had me as team leader but treated me as shift leader and wasn't paid for being one. The only good part was that when it was busy the day went fast and discounts on food."
good,"mutiltasking between store phone,in store pickups,online orders and fixing order stauses"
good,"Offering solutions to customers"
good,This is a place where you get out of it what you put in.  If you want to move up in a company starting at the bottom isn't a bad thing.  This company gives you the opportunity to move up just do to rough patches for the companies known earnings its harder and very results driven.  If you can work in a fast past environment and are willing to work long days and almost every holiday managing at Best Buy isn't a bad job.
good,"I was in charge of the entire team of agents which was in charge of repairs, new pc install, warranty repairs, customer orders, in home network installs, and additional warranty sales. I learned to deal with opportunity customers, handle difficult situations, multitasking every day, dealing with multiple managers, and completing all operations on time.  My coworkers were extremely close with me and we worked well together but authority was well established. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to continuous changes with departments and standard operating procedures. Best Buy was having a difficult time in the market due to internet electronic sales, training employees to maximize sales and opportunity was a constant challenge for the fast pace turn around. The best part is when we all worked together as one to have great weeks and numbers."
good,"Best Buy is a fairly consistent place to work. They have flexible hours, and are very easy to work with if you have other obligations like school or a family. Its retail, so the normal retail duties are expected like shelve stocking, customer service etc etc."
good,"Learned a lot at Best Buy. If you are eager to move forward management will really work with you. Corporate initiatives were a little wacky sometimes, but other than that the people there were great."
good,"A typical day a work consisted on always smiling to customers, being happy and helping them out with all of there electronic needs. I learned to work in a team at this job,because when i wouldn't know something someone would help me or vice versa. Management was pretty good but strict at moments. The part i enjoyed the most was interacting with customers and watching them leave happy and satisfied from the store."
good,"primary responsibility was to run an effective, efficient, and profitable operation which was score carded on a daily basis. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy was a good company to work for. I learned a lot working there and management was very good in taking care of there employees.  I cannot remember a hard day working for best buy but it was always fun. 
good,"My department was very understaffed, which meant that those of us that were there tended to do the work of two people. This situation was only made worse when associates would continuously call out sick and the rest of us would have to carry their work load as well. There were constant changes to our Business Plan and the way it would be implemented, which would result in a lot of confusion and ultimately numerous Customer Disappoints."
good,culture is changing and leadership only promotes people in the inner circle.
good,Would be a good place to work if the company hired employees with a professional attitude and did background checks
good,"My typical day consists of monitoring queues, fixing issues or providing solutions to customers from the previous day and ensuring the flow of the precinct is not disturbed. I have learned time management, people skills, sales, marketing, managing, and self growth from my time spent with Best Buy. I feel that management does the best they can though we've had issues with favoritism at times. My coworkers we're a good team but could be unprofessional at times. The hardest part of the job was the constant problem solving as there was never really a break to catch your breath, it takes a strong person to handle the stress. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team that I worked with and the willingness to help each other succeed. Additionally, working on the viewpoint committee to build camaraderie within the store was enjoyable."
good,Good company to work for when direction is clear. Compensation is probably on the best in retail. There is also a disconnect between corporate and retail when a new company initiative is implemented. There also seems to be too many (well paid I might add) district support managers that by title are responsible for specific areas in a retail store but unfortunately this division is what makes it harder for following directions as you have two different views on approaching a new focus area. this used to be a great learning environment where we actually spent more time teaching basic business 101....now not so much since you are pulled in a dozen directions. The people and customer satisfaction is what made this job fulfilling. I worked not only for the customer but it was my job to make it a safe learning environment for my peers and the associates that worked for me.
good,"retail, real flexable with hours. staff was good to work with."
good,A typical day at the warehouse was pleasant. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help you if there is anything that you may need a hand with.
good,They push a certain way of selling and only praise those who sell an extraordinary amount of product. Hard to advance your position and be promoted within the company.
good,Wish the Store Management was focused more on being a TEAM. Would call you out over the employee radio instead of meeting with you in person.
good,Constantly working on the cash register. Interacting with different types of people and learning new ways of life.
good,"The company itself is a great place to work for, unfortunately the management outside of the store is absolutely horrible and self serving. They aren't big on promoting positive re-enforcement, they also operate on a band of brothers system."
good,Managers are quick to give praise for doing a great job on a sale but if your a good employee and need to call out be prepared to be written up or made to feel guilty.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Best Buy, but unfortunately I was unable to advance. Also the hours were extremely unpredictable, making finishing school almost impossible. I was able to learn more about customer satisfaction, as well as basic sales, which will definitely help me in the future. I was also able to get a real for a more administrative spot towards the end of me time working there, mainly spending my days at a computer and answering phone. I dealt with delivery issues, customer issues, and orders. This showed me that I would like to do something along the lines of an administration position as a career."
good,In my ten years of service I have found that the company itself is a great place to work for. The overall problem that I experienced was that unless you knew someone high up or played the ultimate suck up to upper management game you were less likely to get a promotion you were more than qualified for. I enjoyed most the challenges you faced on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the day, if it is a truck night or not. The day will mostly consist of picking customer orders through our online system, shipping, receiving, and unloading trucks. The hardest part of the job is working with other employees that do not perform their job fully, other employees have to complete their work for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to work with my hands while completing tasks. I also get to use the computer to solve issues and complete shipping and receiving tasks. Every day is different, which helps to make the job non-tedious."
good,job wasn't really structured. not much leadership from people in management positions
good,Typical day at work loads truck with customer products deliver them there is no really hard part coworker ok at times most enjoyable part is going places
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced and can become stressful. I have learned how to learn as I go and have patience and self control. They work around school which is amazing. I will not be a Best Buy lifetimer although it is an amazing job to have. I am blessed to have a job here!
good,Walk in and greet everybody on the floor and ask how their days are going so far. My co workers was the best part of the job. It's always good to work with people who know the job and work well together. I'd run reports to look at the numbers on my team in order to see what we need work on and see what we are doing good.
good,a generally fun place to work because of all the different people working and that you meet in the store
good,Good job for a seasonal or part time employee. Decent benefits and good environment
good,"Our store is severely understaffed, managers and supervisors contradict themselves by saying to do one thing this day then the complete opposite the next. I am pulled every which way every single day saying do this and that while focusing on customers and unloading truck on mondays and thrusdays. Most associates are great to work with. Benefits and compensations are just great, a monthly bonus, reward zone points, and dont forget that discount!"
good,There is no real set training but they do pay well although they do require you to know alot about there products and don't really give you any guides to refer to about the products.
good,Lots of room to grow and develop throughout the company. Work-life balance is the hardest part and takes a lot of you as a family member.
good,"I have learned that working at Best Buy Mobile can give you a lot of experience for your future endeavors. A typical day at work I am doing daily stock counts and making sure the store is in order. I basically take the life of a general manager everyday that my general manager is not here. I keep up with all of the backoffice paperwork and human resource part as well. My main focus has been on sales and making sure we are improving sales and doing everything possible to build clientel. The hardest part of my job is always trying to make the numbers better than they were the previous month, which is a challenge I enjoy. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with and the environment."
good,"A typical day at work is opening the store, keying in our store numbers, reviewing previous day numbers, sharing numbers with store employees and making sure the customers are satisfied with the service they have received. The hardest part of my job is trying to balance working in multiple departments and keeping track of all departments sales trackerd."
good,Sales Based. I focused on finding fit solutions for customers. I learned how to use the information customers provided me with to find perfect solutions.
good,"Pay was below average, no commission means no incentive to sell, but was still pushed hard to make a sale."
good,The Most enjoyable part of the job is finding the right device and plan that is correct for them. How ever this can also be the hardest part as well.
good,Lots of people to help
good,"Great starter job for those in High School, but not the easiest to advance in."
good,Nice place to meet people and network with customers-- part time Christmas money and generally a place to keep me busy and off the couch
good,"Overall, it was enjoyable to work for Best Buy, one of the key problems I noticed however, was that with a somewhat annual restructuring of management after the FY results, only about 40% of new strategy actually gets executed. Old middle managers with old ideas stay in positions where a limited impact will deliver diminishing results in a company that can not afford such results. As initiatives are completed top down, you get more of an opaque understanding than a transparent one."
good,"This was a great job well in high school, but once I was out of college It was time to move on"
good,"Best Buy was a good job for a high school and college student. The pay was great and the hours were generous! Holiday hours were the worst part about the job, but it is a retail company. The worst part about Best Buy is their management! The managers do not care about the employees under them."
good,"At best buy, it's all in WHO you know...your job performance is measured but if your not ""in"" with management or a supervisor, you can kiss any chance of advancement, transferring, or anything needing any type of upper level management co-sign goodbye!"
good,I was thankful to have a job. I learned a great bit about technology and enjoyed my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customer. While the hardest was the distance from home.
good,Geeksquad was a great out of college job which allowed me to apply a lot of the physical repair skill I had learned. I was also able to work on my ability to help customers understand complicated issues.
good,"slow to advance, employees are great!, great helping people, enjoyable employee environment"
good,I have worked there for about a year. I love working there because i like helping people with technology and solving their problems. The only downside to this is that its a part time and i dont get paid much and they expect lots of work out of us. The company has certain rules and policy that is way out of hand which is not fair to the employees that work really hard to make sure the company does well.
good,"Everyday I was expected to comeplete 4 or 5 appointments of IT related issues. I'ved learned hardware and software issues on pc, networking in homes, data management. My customer communications developed because of the services I provided for the company. The hardest thing about the job was to meet company's revenue and the best thing about the company was I was provided with a company vehicle to complete my appointments."
good,"Perfect seasonal job, good benefits, schedule can turn brutal"
good,Not room for advancement and the pay and benefits aren't competitive.
good,"A typical day includes analyzing business results, sales, employee coaching and development, labor management, inventory and pricing management."
good,"This was a poorly run store, I have a feeling their not all the same. It seems like the best supervisors all left shortly after I started"
good,"Youthful fun job, but not much flexibility or room for personality. They do offer decent benefits and tuition reimbursement."
good,Fun environment! Always first to know about new electronics and software that's hitting the market.
good,Enterprise is great for a new college graduate. It teaches everything you need to know about running your own business and how to manage people and financials. It is a lot of work-both time consuming and physically. Pay is not great until you are a branch manager. Most areas make you work at an airport location as well which has very long hours.
good,Working for Best Buy was a great experience. I loved the people I was able to work with. It was a very upbeat and positive work environment. However the company is changing and I am looking for a new and stable company and I can grow and evolve with.
good,"great coworkers, sufficiant compensation. customer focussed, room to grow"
good,"My review based on working at Best Buy was fun at first. Simply who I had for a General manager, Supervisor and Manager were very influential on my development as a Sales Associate to me becoming Senior Sales Leader with the company. What I truly loved about my time at Best Buy were with the diversity of customers that I enjoyed assisting. Once I became a Magnolia senior Sales Leader where I was part of management. I was able to build and train my fellow Best Buy Associates who were looking to advance within the company. By passing on my knowledge, and thus by doing that I was able to get a minimum of five Associates on my level."
good,"This was also a seasonal position. I worked during the holidays where it was a busy work day. Helping multiple customers and cleaning, organizing and make sure we don't take our anger out on customers when we get overwhelmed. The hardest thing was being on our feets for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part was being able to see merchandise before we start saling them."
good,"Best Buy has provided a lot of experience in dealing with new issues. Having SO MANY clients on a day to day basis, you pretty much see everything. I've learned how to handle many difficult issues that result from many different lifestyles."
good,"Its a wonderful place to work, When you start off you have good hrs after few months not to many due to Store #302 GM favoritism, Other then that con its a good place to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A day at Best Buy Mobile varies from time ti time. You deal with all sorts of clients, and help them keep connected to the outside world. I learned a lot working there and and refined my customer service skills. My co-workers are all great and we all get along very well. However, with the new management that caused a few complications. The hardest part of this job is is the security. We are constantly changing managers, and favoritism plays a huge part of our day to day activities. The hardest part will have to be not being able to say anything or speak my mind about the unfairness. However, working at best buy is fun and filled with excitement."
good,"My time at bestbuy was very valuable and i learned many lessons about how sales work, how teams work together to achieve a goal, and how to manage my time wisely"
good,Management costly overlooking to ensure sale. tough economy makes for tough sale. not surprised that best buy is going under
good,"Mobile Representative, servicing and assisting customers with selling and activation of mobile devices."
good,It was a great learning experience for me as my team was diverse and full of talented people.
good,"While the management didn't do such a wonderful job keeping day to day affairs stable, the employees were genuinely friendly. If your a good salesman I'd recommend the job, and if your not then this isn' the job for you because its pushed upon you at every moment to entice customers and push services."
good,Great place to work if you like retail and electronics. Can be very stressful especailly during the holidays. Does not really care about your home life unless you've worked there long enough to get to know the team.
good,"I have worked for Best Buy several times, and I have noticed that they pretty much follow the same patterns. The people they hire are usually the same type of person, outgoing and friendly, which is a plus when it comes to work environments. When it comes to promoting they rarely pick the person most qualified, and it is all about whose good side you are on. The usually only hire part time associates but give full time hours. If you complain about working full-time hours but not getting full-time benefits, they usually drop your hours rather than create a plan for you to get promoted to a full-time associate. Other than that it is a fun place to work so long as you don't mind the work schedule."
good,"I gained a lot of my first work experience here, but it was never too difficult. Older employees didn't help the new people too much. It was overstaffed with not enough hours for everyone."
good,Best Buy was a good company to work for. I was hired as a seasonal employee. The company includes a decent customer satisfaction network and employee job satisfaction.
good,I did job stuff there. It was cool when I did the thing that made it so that the tech stuff worked good and stuff. Just trying to get to the 150 character minimum.
good,fun place to work and good atmosphere. lots of interactions on a daily basis so it was always something new and exciting going on. lots of new products so it was always something to learn
good,Company doesn't care about employees. as long as you can make sales you wont have many problems. You will be expected to berate customers into applying for the credit card and tts
good,"I truly llke everyone i work with, i feel important at work, everyone feels safe when i am at work, my job is always completed and done rught when i am there"
good,On a daily basis I am organizing and preparing for shipment. Labeling and sorting products in appropriate place to make things accessible  for customers. Best Buy is always a productive place because if I'm not engaging with customers then I'm working with my team to properly put products in the designated place.
good,Constantly adding new work activities and responsibilies without added compensation. No real or practical training. Only online activities.  Very politically correct.
good,Fine sales environment. I experienced harassment from customer's and employees alike. I complained many times to management and nothing was done to even discipline employees about inappropriate behavior.
good,"Used to be a great work environment, however, managers changed. You have to be willing to stand up for yourself when necessary. Love the company as a whole, just wish they valued their workers a little big more."
good,"Typical retail work environment. Never had any problems with co-workers. Whenever help was needed, you could reach out to someone. The pay wasn't great though and everyone could have used a class or two about the products and work related tasks at hand."
good,"It’s an okay job. Made some good friends. I would recommend as a good in between job. It can get hectic sometimes, especially during the holidays. Employee discount rocks."
good,Working at geeksquad is more retail driven than technical driven. Have to meet certain numbers and sales within the department. Basic computer troubleshooting. Most likely the team and staff is fun to work with.
good,My co-workers were very nice. Fun place to work. Management was cool. Morning meetings were a good time. Got to play silly team building games. Learned a lot about electronics.
good,"Very laid back although with that came the flaw of very little training, most of my learning came from on the job experience. The manager and some other seasoned employees would disappear for hours on end."
good,"Strong leaders are far and few between. Managers can be so driven to meet KPI's that they forget how to motivate and inspire their team members. Thats not to say that there are not great leaders, but dependent of the culture in the market. Compensation is rewarding especially from a STI stand point, but work life balance can be difficult at times. Overall a great experience despite my initial commentary."
good,"Great place to work, If you love to talk technology all day! The ability to help people without having to make the sale makes it much more relaxed as if you were working on commission."
good,Low bar for entry but the do reward good work. Don't recommend staying for a long period of time. Management can vary from location to location but they seem to mostly be okay. Management has a lot of bonus potential based off performance of the store so that can attract a lot of negative behavior toward low performing employees.
good,You have to meet a lot of standards and do all sorts of numbers and push the Best Buy card like crazy which can be frustrating but it’s not a terrible job
good,"Everyone was very helpful and supportive.  The staff kept changing frequently, which made it hard to keep track of who works there.  I learned the duties of the back warehouse and how to price items out on the floor.  Overall my experience was mostly positive."
good,Nice environment to work in but managers tried to delegate too much work to staff without proper compensation. When I worked for the Geeksquad they did not pay what the IT field pays for the work we were doing.
good,Working there was fun. Met a lot of great people. Was able to build relationships. Networking for the future. Was able to get employees promoted and making lifelong friends
good,"Received, pick, pack and ship merchandise in a safe, productive and accurate manner. "
good,Very laid back work environment with little stress. Managers and coworkers are great with great benefits. Lower on the pay scale compared to similar jobs in the field.
good,This job lead to to where i am now being in sales. A good job to get your foot into the door if you're finding out what you like. The staff was nice and took care of situations as needed.
good,"My time was from an hourly role to a General Manager. "
good,I learned a lot about staying busy during slow hours and working g with a team to complete a collective goal. The hardest part of the job was staying as a team and being pitted against each other to get the highest scores and percentages for sales.
good,"Best buy was once a great place to work, but when they restructured+brought in new CEOs they focused more and more on profitability as opposed to employee growth, knowledge, and overall happiness. I was screwed out of a lead position twice for people who knew nothing about the department, then they completely got rid of the positions. Some time later they closed the store and though they tried to relocate us there weren't enough positions and I couldn't take a oaycut from my already substandard pay."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoy best buy but at times the pressure from management to hit sales goals can be depressing. The culture at best buy is great but when you do not hit your sales goal your boss will be down your throat about it.
good,Great place to work with the ability to learn and succeed. Something new everyday when installing speakers and tvs. Able to build client relationships to give the best experience possible.
good,"And I dont mean paycheck wise. I mean interaction with others wise. Out of the 6 different jobs I've been in, Best Buy by far has the worst management I've ever dealt with. They are very unappreciative, manipulative, and extremely limiting people."
good,good job to start off little room to succeed. they are always cutting hours. i would say apple but also start looking for other jobs. the co-workers are better
good,"Love the people and the company is good to us but we seem replaceable and there is not a lot of growth, it feel difficult to grow in this company unless management is your interest"
good,Employees work hard to create a strong workplace culture despite the lack of real effort from management. High job turnovers and reducing compensation.
good,"Not the best culture, not a lot of room for advancement, non proportional pay to duties in some departments, not a lot of room for a work life balance"
good,"After working Best Buy for many years and a few locations, I feel like I have learned a lot. I have learned that moving up is very difficult. Full-time is usually 2-3 out of the 10 in each department and someone has to either die or retire to get those spots. The benefits are meh. You're just a number in the system and management doesn't care about your success in the company, unless you're chosen to move up. "
good,"the company is a good starting point for anyone trying to move up to a better job down the line, Good for someone looking for a job until they finish school"
good,I learned a lot and I was close with all my coworkers. There was a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement. The management was awesome and the employees were trained very well.
good,"It's typical corporate, but with a twist.  The company has gone overboard with diversity and inclusion to the extent of discriminating against individuals who do not fit a category or do not champion the cause.  I have championed treating everyone like a human being deserving of respect.  But, that is a radical notion here."
good,"productive and fun. team events. open for over time. learning technical skills, enreaching knowledge in electronic domain about various brands and products. "
good,"I was working seasonally in Home Theater and Computers, as I started fairly late into the season and wasn't kept on after the seasonal period ended I don't really have all that much to say."
good,"I truly enjoyed my actual job at Best Buy however, management made it impossible to work to my full potential and were over bearing and at times down right awful to their employees. Schedules were unfair and there was little to no work life balance."
good,Recommander pour débuter dans le domaine informatique et avoir un bon bagage pour le début de carrière.
good,"Work was exciting and a lot of great people there. Downsides were terrible seating arrangements that make you feel like a number, very little work from home and relatively inflexible schedule"
good,"I had a great time working there."
good,Great place to work and nice people to deal with. Each day learns something new and experiences different things. Most advanced technology and devices you can learn and work with.
good,Best Buy is a very fast paced environment that requires you to think quickly when assisting customers. They care about there employees and try to keep the workplace safe.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working loss prevention for Best Buy required me to be polite and helpful to any customer that approached me, but also required me to assume anyone was looking to steal. While the job itself wasn't incredibly difficult, the psychological impact of assuming the worst out of people you don't know can wear down someone who doesn't have the right personality for the job."
good,"When they had the older management, things were working a lot better than they are now. a typical work day would be 8 to 4 and you would get a route have to load up the truck, have pre calls already done and then call client on way to address. drop off or install product and go on to the next client."
good,Best Buy did a good job of helping  me establish my career path.  Started out as a part time home theater rep and finished as the Home Theater Supervisor
good,The company itself was very professional and very tedious with who they chose to hire. It was a fun job but also very demanding due to sales and holiday seasons. You get to meet different preppie from all walks of life from co workers to the customers.
good,"It was an overall good experience. Coworkers were great and you can learn a lot just by being in the store.  Manage was up and down however. Most of the managers were reasonable with scheduling, which is a plus."
good,Very nice place to work.  Likes how willing the staff was willing to help. Long hours hut good pay and kept me busy and on my toes. Good place to work
good,"Trying to sell as many TV's as possible, while keeping everything clean and down stocked, plus no holidays or weekends off. ..........................................."
good,The company goes through a lot of changes and the way your supervisor manages the transitions will dictate how you feel in your role and in the company.  As a member of a field team for 6+ years I felt a strong connection to my team even though we were spread out over multiple states.
good,"Working at BestBuy was very helpful when it came to learning essential customer service skills such as multi-tasking, professionalism, and organization. Hardest part of working in customer service was when it got busy, other team members couldn't help because only 2 employees and the manager had training for customer service, so it got very stressful at times. The best part of BestBuy hands down was the people. The employees were awesome and made going to work enjoyable"
good,Company can be good in certain locations. I suggest scoping out the location. When I moved I looked for at my new location. It was a blessing I did. They were rude and seemed to work against each other rather than in a cohesive manner.
good,"Best Buy used to be THE place to work for people who love retail and technology. The campaign to ""be human"" has resulted in a stressful and underpaid environment where the leaders care more about the results than the wellbeing of the employees."
good,The culture of Bestbuy was never short of fun. The atmosphere was as great as it can get for retail. Working with tech was great because you always had your hands on the newest tech first.
good,"Its a nice place to work, because you develop many skills, like costumer service, practice your english, because comes people from all over  the world. Also you lerarn how to play in a team roll."
good,Very friendly and positive work environment.This job is one that has teamwork that is implemented.The management team worked with staff when time off was needed and understood family was important.
good,"The work environment was okay. "
good,"Personally, I was a good seller when on the floor. But it took a while to get into the swing of things because they do NOT teach you about any products you are selling. They took me and put me on the floor and told me to sell. You have to be good at adapting. It is a SUPER clique-y type of workspace ."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"learned a lot about electronics while working there, very modern company. there are goals to meet though. nice place to work if you are in to electronics"
good,Il s'agit d'un emploi étudiant qui était flexible avec mon horaire.
good,"okay pay, trained well, great customers, competitive, some immaturity among the staff. thank you for taking the time to read my review so that i can now meet the word limit required."
good,"Great in between job. The benefits are awesome, especially the discount. It all comes at a cost though. Retail is retail, after all. Definitely would recommend as a job to get if you're in college."
good,"I worked there seasonal as geek squad agent, manager was a nice person and the wage was decent. Job was pretty relaxed and goals weren’t unreasonable to attain"
good,"An awesome place to work if you love technology and/or a relaxed environment. The one major downfall was that the company made every employee (that was not a manager) 100% replaceable. It's a large company and i understand that it's hard to make every employee feel secure and respected. However, it seemed as though they didn't try at all. I loved my coworkers and the fun we would have, but I would never go back. An awesome job if you're in school or between jobs."
good,"As a warehouse stocker it can get hectic and intense. Be prepared to get sweaty and tired. Apart from that, you have to do online orders & ship out items."
good,"Typical day at best is just coming into work and ensure all costumer were service before doing any of daily routine work. Many such making nobody stealing, checking all receipts  accordingly, make sure the the shelf’s were full with supply."
good,I first worked instore and learnt how to sell and become one of the top salesman in the distract and got promoted to senior quickly. after that the promotions stop but the promise to move up did not. So i changed things up and went over to geeksquad where i had a great time besides bestbuys involvement with installs.
good,"Generally the company was well to work for. The pay was decent for the time. I left for a number of reasons,  work life balance being a big one. "
good,"Starting the hiring process, the one in charge is clueless. The Customer Service supervisor is a hypocrite and the General Manager could be better. These people only want you to do your daily/monthly numbers and won't even care to help you. Once they notice you are not good for them, they'll stop scheduling you until you voluntarily quit."
good,"Pros:"
good,Bestbuy is a good workplace to work and have great benefits and great pay and great people to work with however the managers are very favorable to people who been there the longest and give them less work to do and put more work on new comers
good,"•	Provide product delivery information to customers and regional distribution teams"
good,Good place to work and the customers are friendly. No Best Buy does not work on commission we have regular hourly pay. Sometimes we receive bonuses but the company offer other incentives.
good,"It has been a few years since I worked here, but the time spent was not awful. Opportunities for advancement were quite limited. Hours were significantly limited at times, and working part-time exclusively for Best Buy was not a viable way to live, even with roommates. Management can be biased, or unmotivated, at times."
good,"I did not like it much."
good,good place to work but has changed a lot.  pressure is a at the fore front to hit your numbers no matter what.   After awhile everyone feels like they have an expiry date.
good,The job was easy and calm but it was only temporary. There was always work and over time the mangment was great the hours as well. If I could go back I would.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,it was alright. the managers worked well with school schedule. No complaints. Worked at two separate locations enjoyed the time I was there. Left because I was heading out for deployment.
good,not a bad company to work for. flexible in scheduling. but stringent on following their rules/sales approaches. I learned alot. Ive worked for better companies and also for worse companies.
good,"The location closed very soon after I came on board. The company did work hard to relocate as many employees to other locations as possible, but some had to leave."
good,"There was not a lot of direction at times. The surrounding team members made working a pleasure. I learned skills such as time management, interpersonal relations, sales, and collaboration. Customers had individual needs and concerns, which made for a challenging yet exciting experience. Management does stress performance above all else, no excuse is a reasonable excuse. Individuals who are easily stressed will not enjoy being held accountable and micro managed constantly."
good,Fellow employees talked with each other. Good about time off if give notice. never sent home early so hours were set and one could budget. could alway talk with management
good,I really enjoyed it at first but it seems that now its more about selling someone everything then selling them the right thing. Plus the fact that they are introducing the progressive leasing which seems predatory.
good,"Was a fun place, I loved the people working nights was chill re-stocking stuff. Wasn't a bad job would recommend it to others if you like cool people."
good,"Too much emphasis on credit cards. Job made me miserable and I hated going to work. Didn't care of I was hurt, they just card about credit card applications."
good,"I get along with most people that I work with, including a few managers, but the store I work in is run very poorly and it's only getting worse with time. If you are just looking for a part-time gig, this is a decent place to work, but if you would like secure full-time employment, this place is less than ideal. They seem to be very disorganized, they are constantly eliminating positions, moving people around, overhiring  and understaffing departments. "
good,"Loved my crew didnt enjoy the job. I dont know how else to say it. A great group of people to work with but annoying unrealistic expectations for you too meet, and the training was nowhere near my house but from 9-5 so i got stuck in 2+ hours of traffic to and every day."
good,overall the people is what i liked most about best buy but they don't pay enough to be able to support yourself in the state of Colorado which is a bummer because i did enjoy working there
good,"Some managers are terrible, some are awesome, the store I worked for no longer exists. I didn't want to write this review but it seems I'm being forced to for some reason."
good,"As the title says geeksquad repair has always been a little crazy with the workload. Not really an issue once you find your groove, the benefits for full time were nice, and so was most of the staff. With the new CEO, TTS push(bootcamp) AASP(Apple repair same day) It became very stressful. 25 computers to do in 3 days, random iPhone repairs at any time, that takes you away from computer repair an hour per phone. It's pretty much an unofficial lead position with a lot of specialized job duties on top of client interaction.You will do every geeksquad job as an ARA.  Left due to poor compensation that was not competitive and could not come to a pay agreement. It paid the same as a cashier after 5 years of dedication. Also under staffed and hard to use vacation time. I would suggest staying away till the smoke clears and not taking under 15hr for this job."
good,Make friends with management if you want to advance and get more hours. Other than that it’s a very easy job to work at. Holiday time and weekends will be the most fast paced.
good,"Best Buy was a fun, quick moving environment, I enjoyed working with my co-workers but Best Buy failed in Management, Turn Over, and being able to keep workers motivated. Especially in the Mobile Department"
good,"The quotas are way too High for the payoff. You're tasked with hitting a lot of targets with no commission and this job isn't competitive pay. There is a lot of room to grow if you're In the right store, give it a lot of time and hit goals consistently."
good,"I worked for Best Buy for over a year, starting seasonal, then part time, then full time. Which is a pretty great advancement compared to what most companies allow. I enjoy working in the merchandising department the best - It is a great for people who are introverted but productive, and who love learning how to do new things. There was rarely a dull moment in a good way. The pay was good enough for where I lived. The corporate side added tons of small benefits, programs, and whatnot that was nice. However, I had move to a different town because I was transferring colleges. The Best Buy in my new location did not let me easily transfer though I was assured I would be. Instead I had to interview as if I were a new employee though there were openings for my same position. Ultimately they did not hire me and decided to keep their seasonal employees instead. Though they did not tell me for over a month, leaving me without a job and income for that time and until I got a new job. It felt very betraying. If you plan on stay where you are for a while, it can be a great job, but trying to transfer was a disaster and caused me to almost be homeless."
good,I worked here as a seasonal sales employee. I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said a million times before. There was a constant pressure to meet sale quotas.
good,"Limiting in what kind of Technical work that could be done."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Learnt a lot from working at Best Buy. Main target was to achieve sales target. Being a sales associate I got to know how to achieve the target and fulfill the customers's demand and satisfaction
good,This is a great job for someone looking for sales experience or to earn a little bit of cash but the pay is low and people are walked over. Availability is never followed and management is lazy.
good,Good opportunity for growth. Interesting group of people. Very good benefits. Management sucks most of the time. Job security is a joke. Fun place to work for a short time.
good,Overnight shift was not for me. You will need to put in a lot of effort if you are travelling to this location for the night shift. It was fair work but be sure to be close to these working locations.
good,"Typical work day consisted of working on computer issues and or face to face interactions with customers. Used a lot of software tools provided to help with computer issues. Co-workers were great. Management was kinda all over the place. Communication wasn't the greatest with them."
good,"Typically at BestBuy you are encouraged to sell service plans, protection on devices, and multiple credit card applications daily. I learned better selling skills and time management in this position. The workplace culture does seem to be beginning to decay as the management is turning on each other and ultimately blaming anyone but the true culprit in all situations. There are a few great managers and plenty of great coworkers, but you can only thrive so much without enough support from those you look up to. I worked for the company for 3 years, but towards the end I had to leave before I was brought down in the aftermath of all the corruption."
good,Too many chiefs not enough indians sums it up. Fun place to work but too many changes being made. Managers didnt want to do actual work - nor did they train their associates.
good,"Best Buy is a fun and engaging company to be with and I learned a lot. However, it is very obvious that promotions are given to those who know those who are higher up."
good,Great management and co-workers but you're pushed to sell credit cards and other services without any incentive. Working with customers is mostly terrible but every once in a while you work with someone nice.
good,"Overall, the Best buy work environment in the location I worked at was okay. I was able to gain experience and learn a few things, I do wish the management was better. The manager I worked with did not give me the best experience."
good,worked part time. the job wasn't hard but the pay wasn't great. the hours were flexible and the management was understanding but that was almost 10 years ago.
good,Learned a lot but if you can not keep up in a fast paced technology environment this may not be the best place for you. Best buy is a great company to work for overall but my particular location was very hectic and management was okay but not efficient especially if trying to work as a great team to work together.
good,"The management left something to be desired, not many career opportunities and the biweekly pay isn't the best. Overall a good starting job and a fun place to work."
good,"I worked harder at Best Buy than I have a lot of other jobs. They don’t pay you enough for everything they have you do and management can be very very bad. For a retail store though you can’t been the benefits if you get full time pto, paid holidays, traveling etc"
good,Great company if you like selling. The management team is truly invested in your success. The store is fast paced and I really like the customer service aspect of my job.
good,"The pay is reasonable, and they usually try to work with you on your hours.  I work in the warehouse, where we are a good team, and try to promote a team environment"
good,sales driven management was very flexible and colleges where very friendly to work with. Sales goals are very capable and a lot of room to grow from within
good,First job and thats about it. nothing to it better then working any other retail store though at least theres electronics everywhere. not alot of room to advance
good,Working here I’ve learned to stay focus an pay close attention. Because you can miss out on A lot. I loved how I’ve learned to grasped my own clients if I wanted to open my own Best Buy.
good,"But the GM will cut you quick if you under perform, other than that expect cool customers most of the time and a pretty laid back shift unless its early morning on the weekends."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting the opening managers and preparing for the sales floor before the store opens. Spending three years working at Best Buy offered a ton of knowledge on the major importance of teamwork and how the warehouse employees other than me is the backbone of the entire store. What I specifically handled was making sure products delivered from UPS were dropped off and received into the store systems accurately and staging other requested transfers to be picked up and delivered. "
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy because it showed me a different aspect of it. I was able to learn about retail sales as well as how to operate a cash register system.
good,I like working for Best Buy in the early years. but as times went  on I liked working there less. The type of work they were asking for didn't work the pay they were giving.
good,"Nothing amazing, a typical retail job where your goal is to sell as much product with as many accessories as possible.  If that is your goal that this place is for you."
good,"The Goals where very Unrealistic for some shifts and easy for others this made is hard because the goals where the same for the department. it added stress to this job, made some feel good and others feel bad even though from the hours they worked they sold to every customer. the office politics played a huge part if you would like working there. favoritism was a real problem with some management while other management was very good and supportive to the whole store it just depended on who was working the store that day if you where to have a enjoyable, productive day or a stressed and long day. but thats with most sales jobs i guess"
good,"Auto techs are pressured to both install, sell, service write and do admin work on-top of what the ere actually hired to do. Yet no one seems to understand wy they keep quiting."
good,"Normally, as a new hire, you walked around following a real employee most of the time. Also, you had to do daily check-ins and coaching which is a pain. The management seemed fine to me, and I was able to communicate easily with all of the workers there. To me, it seems like a lot of the workers are younger people which could be a downside for some. The hardest part was selling the GSP and TTS for Best Buy while getting people to apply for the best buy credit card. In my opinion, this took away from the whole selling computers and seemed to be more about the company than getting the customers to enjoy shopping with us."
good,"- Customer service"
good,"good place to work, lots of good people to work with, good managers for the most part. Steady pace work place. Hardest part of the job is figuring out what product is missing. Easiest part communication."
good,"it was fun, the customers where kind and remembered me. i got to work with customer to fix their things. the employees were really friendly and worked well in a team."
good,"This is pretty much like any retail job. You will learn a lot about technology."
good,so the hardest part of the job is jobwork/life balance missing alot of family stuff to make sure that the company is making $$ but at the end of the day its not a really bad place to work
good,"Overall it was an ok experience, the management was professional and the employees were very engaged with their cliental. Several departments open up the possibility for growth."
good,Sometimes hard work dealing with customers. It was awesome to learn and gain knowledge. My management team in the beginning was super supportive and I appreciate my time I worked there.
good,"Co-workers made the time here go by quickly and they were fun! I learned a lot from there. Management started out great, but during my last year it rapidly declined"
good,"Great first job- learned great customer service, how to work on a team, time management, sales and scheduling services, great experiences and fun environment"
good,The management in the section that I worked in were nice. One supervisor was unprofessional and could careless if you were yelled at. As long as the group as a whole looked good that's all that mattered.
good,"Store management makes a big difference. A good manager can make the job fun and rewarding while a poor manager can make the job a nightmare. I have worked in 4 different stores and two were the pits. Corporate culture is not as good. If you are over 50, forget about any advancement within the store. A lot of emphisis is placed on credit card apps. Retaliation if you miss your quota."
good,This place tracks everything you do. They give hours off production so if you aren't okay with constantly selling stuff this isnt the place for you. Even as cashier you have to get people to sign up for credit card apps or get protection plans or you will work 2 days out the week If not
good,Every thing is driven by store associates who are hired to do one thing but are tasked with doing anything and everything even out side of their direct roles
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Hard to advance upwards and grow in the company because positions other than entry level are very limited, pay is somewhat competitive to your region."
good,Best But really just thinks of it’s employees as numbers. Metrics on a spreadsheet and easy to sacrifice for a dollar. That trickle down is felt from store managers to department leads and associates. The opportunity for advancement is so contrived and worth he wrong manager your doomed to ride a few rungs and then be stuck there for years. The discount is very good though.
good,"Earning potential is only good if you are in management."
good,Semi-flexible hours constant customer facing. If you don't like people you won't like the job; If you do then you will. You literally are a retail salesmen keep that in mind.
good,Very great job for an individual looking for a sales position. helps you focus on customer thoughts and customer service. Great for expanding your experience in customer likes and dislikes.
good,"There is a lot of hiring and leaving in this store. The management team seems to try to listen to their employee's suggestions or concerns, but it rarely leads to modifications in the workplace."
good,"This would be a great job if they hired directly. Instead of this, they utilize and thus inherently abuse temp workers. They also have no rules with how to handle re-sellers. Their policy ranges from allowing everything to canceling/banning everything depending on who you ask. They also lack consistency in other areas as one employee will do things a certain way, a second employee will say its wrong and do it a different way, and then a third employee will say that both are wrong and do it a 3rd way. This makes it so that no matter what you do, someone will always say your doing things wrong, when in fact you could be completely right. Through it all, management doesn't care, and will also just blame you despite it being their own lack of consistency and ineffective management in teaching employees to follow a specific policy."
good,"Did not work directly for best buy, it was through a vendor, in a work from home environment, which was the best part of the job, overall. It was typical customer service, dealing with angry or upset customers."
good,Used to be great. Now the company focuses on credit cards and their Geek Squad services. All locations show great favoritism. The only way to ensure advancement is through making nice with upper management.
good,"Provide direct supervision, coaching, training, development, and performance management of supervisors and associates. Oversee all store HR practices and Employee Practice Audit compliance processes. Monitor store P&L with primary focus on storewide controllable expense metrics and partner with leadership to ensure they are equipped to make informed decisions regarding expenses. Ensure customers are being processed efficiently and effectively. Share accountability with other store leadership to develop talent and build a sales culture where employees clearly understand what is expected to deliver business results."
good,It's a good job but you never know when you might go home you might do 6 hours or 12.you have 2 breaks one 10 minutes the other 20 it depends on the day
good,"At beginning was enjoyable and opportunities we always open to move up."
good,"The store is on the way downward and the management is atrocious, when it has fully staffed management. I was there for nearly 2 years and I never had a proper supervisor, always the assistant store manager, or the appliances (I wasn't appliances), or inventory (also not)."
good,continued to improve on backroom and stocking skills. shifts consisted of overnight work on a shipment team. some night would go past the time required to work due to the size of the shipments.
good,"Working at Best Buy it’s hard to find advancement, it great for college students as they do accommodate class schedules. The pace is just as any retail company, good discounts."
good,Good job as long as you have managers committed to development as far as the store and employees. If you're in higher roles you could have a set schedule or if your part time they are flexible
good,"Nice entry level job, really great discounts, however, there is no opportunities for career advancement. Manager was nice and provided good leadership."
good,Working at Best Buy is like working with a bunch of high schoolers who are allowed to do whatever they want. The gossip is out of control and the managers and supervisors are a part of the problem.
good,Wanted to continue to learn the business and also be paid and utilized at work. Not enough hours which meant not enough money to pay the bills. Enjoyable environment when the store is busy.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"good work place "
good,"This is a good job for people who want to learn how to be a great sales rep for the biggest electronic store on the planet. "
good,Tell people about the plans that were available and was actually allowing them to receive by the company and based on credit. Talking individuals into doing credit checks and purchasing extra products with the devices that were chosen.
good,"Best buy teaches employees valuable skills that will translate to many careers after finishing college or school.  That being said, it is not the best for long term career advancement."
good,It's a retail job; do I really need to say anymore? Great for pocket cash but not enough to eat off of. A bit too fast paced given how little pay you're given.
good,Overall a great place to begin your retail career.  Lots of training opportunities and the discounts were great.  Management can be a little stiff but overall pleasant.
good,Coworkers who chose to leave their posts and socialize with other while I did customer service alone. One manager was extremely professional while the others seemed to want to go home the moment they stepped in.
good,Working here hasn't been an issue outside of disappering management and low wages. I've been here as long as I have cause I enjoy the people I work with and enjoy helping others.
good,Good start if you want to get IT knowledge. The team I worked with provided assistance in guiding me to know more about IT and initially motivated me into getting my IT degree.
good,Teaches you to work fast pace and multitask Also a great first experience and the hours are also very good especially when its peek season 10 to 12 hours shifts great holiday spending money
good,"The pay is not great, but the benefits are pretty nice. The customers make or break your day. No commision. Usually have to work with good people who know their stuff."
good,"Let me start by saying this is my experience and my opinion, others may have their own.  The management helped me in amazing ways at the start, and even aided in my moving to Autotech.  However, after I was back in the bay I was promised a certain pay, which never happened.  There was a full-time position that opened up but they literally gave me the run around until the person they wanted to apply did and they got full-time.  When they were full time they got around 30 hours a week, I get 15-20.  I love the job itself, but Best Buy is very money oriented, even to the expense of their employees.  They will make promises and make it seem too good to be true, it is.  Others may have a different experience, and there is the problem.  It should be the same for everyone, it isn't."
good,"Decent managment, not enough hours. Wanted full time but only got around 20 hours unless it was during holidays. Long boring days and no commission but sales are very pushed."
good,I love the fact that I feel welcome being a part of best buy. A typical day starts out with me coming at noon and working to close. i am tasked to do all of the tedious work within the store
good,Asked for time off to go visit girlfriend in Japan and was told that we would figure something out. The week before I leave I was asked to have my whole department sign off saying it was ok for me to leave. If they didn’t then I had to quit. Manager was in talks with one of the employees and teamed up to not sign my paper in the end forcing me to quit.
good,Let me find out that I enjoy sales with out huge risk. Moving up takes time and pay is not as much as other jobs. Credit cards are a big push and so are service plans.
good,"I really enjoyed this job, but the managers weren't nice people and chose favorites.The place itself was very nice and fun and i really enjoyed working there."
good,Could have been better management. There was no structure around schedules and it was very unfair to get in trouble when you had no clue that your schedule changed.
good,"i didn't like many of my work mates. i was never given the chance to excel as i was a seasonal employee. i wanted to move into sales, but i was stuck at till."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Started at Best Buy as a Part Time Wireless Sales Consultant.  Got promoted to Full Time within about 3-4 months.  Loved working as a team and being able to drive our team to #1 in the Territory.  After a year in the Mobile setting, I was promoted to Back Office Leader/Hiring Coordinator.  I absolutely loved this job!  It was one of two positions that actually had a set schedule.  The job included Cash Management, Hiring and Recruiting, Policy Adherance within the store, Employee File Maintenance, and Front End Leadership.  The company as a whole says they stand by their employees and want to offer them the best, but that is highly misleading.  After 3 years as a BOL, the position was eliminated through a Corporate Restructure.  In total, 296 people lost their positions that were in my job code.  The restructure went all the way up to Territory Level.  Once your position is eliminated, they could care less about you as an employee.  During the last restructure, positions were added so those who were being phased out had a position.  Not this time around.  So, I took my severance plan and ran with it.  Can't wait to see what's happening in the next few years with the company."
good,Haven't worked their in years but it was nice. The store manager was caring and great. My direct manager of the unit wasn't very good. Learned better people skills working there.
good,"Very biased favoritism in moving up."
good,"*Collaborated with and directed the skills of the team members, further activating the Standard Operating Platform, to deliver more effective customer service. "
good,Basic retail environment with emphasis on product expertise. I exclusively worked in Geek Squad and it was mostly customer service but I did learn a lot about basic computer repair. When I moved into management I was removed almost entirely from Geek Squad and my days consisted of unnecessary supervisory tasks. It became clear that the management model was overwhelmingly flat and any opportunities for advancement would consist of purely retail.
good,"Typical Day at Work: Moving from back stocking room to store floor, either watching over the environment's security systems, or assisting customers."
good,Best Buy has a really bad and strict HR and the management is really biased. The benefits weren’t that good and the extreme pressure of getting Best Buy credit cards just so the managers can bonus
good,"it was fun but pay was horrible. no raises in sight and they made sure there was no wiggle room for your life , if something happened that caused you to be late they simply did not care"
good,"A lot of dealing with people that don't really know what they are talking about, but the customer is always right. I am not really sure what typing this has to do with getting a new job but here i am"
good,I enjoyed working there but if your head wasnt up the manager or leaders butt you didnt move up in the company based on work ethics or ability... Just fyi
good,Fun work environment but main focus is all about customers and explaining various electronic devices to them and developing a customer service relationship with them.
good,Best Buy was a great company to work for when I first came out of college. They are easy to work for. Mangers are willing to work with your schedule.  Wages are okay.
good,"Steady work,laid back no more to say if I have no more to say you can't make me write to go to the next step. The job is fine the work is steady not too much micro managing"
good,"the people are all great to work with but the managers are always following someone around during sales and trying to actively coach you on pitching the credit card... even after telling them the customer has said no multiple times. pay is good, but the anxiety from dealing with the managers seems to have everyone in a constant state of panic to meet sales goals. days when the store is dead are chill but you're blamed constantly for not making sales on those days... sales goals are hard to make when everyone is scheduled on the same day to prepare for the weekend rushes that never seem to appear."
good,"I worked the front end of a best buy, mainly returns in the morning, opening the customer service desk and processing pickups, for about 9 months. My best buy was in a nice shopping center and was well blessed with wonderful employees who made it a blast to work there...somedays. I do not know if it was my best buy ,but word of mouth was that it was not, but the management were absolutely terrible at managing. Basically the way it worked was if you worked well, they would keep you just under full time hours (28-35) and essentially dangle promotions at you only to hire from an outside store. This happened with my co workers on three occasions. Now this alone would be enough to make some people upset but then the worse part is management truly does not appreciate a good worker but will appreciate a bad worker if they were in any way intimidating. Managers would roll over backwards for employees who routinely left their work stations messes and would be half an hour late and leave 2 hours early every single day. However I will say the employees behind the scenes were wonderful and helped through a lot of trying times and I remain friends with a few of them to this day. It's a hard job but it was a job ya know?"
good,typical day was stressful with little to no help in the warehouse. One of the departments that always needed double coverage but never had it. Single coverage made the job stressful.
good,This was just a seasonal job for extra Christmas money.  I was only there for a few months.  Was not able to keep it due to to other commitments. I did enjoy working there.
good,The hardest part of the job are the managers . Managers would usually bring you down if not won’t appreciate what is done . Managers would have their days when they wanted to be sweet or mean. When it came to scheduling hours they would pick and choose who they wanted to work and won’t give others house due to “ wave change.”
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, presión en ventas cuando no es por comisión, sino por asesoría de compra, trato desigual entre empleados y jefes de piso de venta. Buenas y regulares capacitaciones, otras que no tenían nada nuevo que ofrecer para retroalimentar."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,CAn be frustrating at times. Pay is ok. Better at some locations than others. Micromanaging gets annoying. Don’t think there is enough incentive for all the employee expectations.
good,Nice place to start and get some sales experience. I was able to get a lot of face to face time with customers and receive a lot of customer service experience.
good,The Best Buy I worked at was very professional and was a friendly environment. It was a good learning experience and I believe my customer service skills were improved greatly by the job.
good,Working at best buy was quite difficult only because I did not get the right and proper training. At the time I started working there were some management issues that lead me to the direction on leaving that workplace.
good,nice place to work.fun atmosphere and very friendly staff and customers.the most enjoyable part was learning something new everyday.the most unpleasant part of that particular job was the hours
good,"Es buena institución, solo falta que aprovechen el potencial de su equipo laboral, con mejores remuneraciones."
good,Best Buy was a great place to work during my four year undergraduate career. The management is great and understanding while working around student schedules.
good,Nothing notable about working here. Easy to get hired during the holiday season and the employee discount is great. The one I worked at only had a Sonic's within walking distance so either bringing your own lunch or being able to drive would be helpful.
good,"Best Buy RDC is very easy work in the department that I was in, you have to make sure that you have accuracy and the numbers to be able to become an employee through Best Buy, attendance is key."
good,management is poor and does not care about training employees they focus on their bonuses and forget the employees.  employees are have low moral and management does nothing to help.
good,Overall a positive experience. There were a few challenges and opportunity for growth beyond my skillset when I arrived. There frequent reviews of progress. Seasonal position.
good,This is an okay place to work if you've never had a job before and are trying to find employment. You will need to learn a little bit about the different kinds of products they offer
good,Typical retailer focused on service sales. Great discount and fun work envriorment. Fast paced decent pay. work load is well balanced. Flexible hours.
good,"The people will keep you with the company. You’ll fight for them and want them to thrive. Best Buy adapts very well and makes structural changes when needed to stay relevant in consumer electronics. They offer good bonus structures, discounts, and health benefits. Good leadership and work environment make it enjoyable to come to work, even when circumstances aren’t always favorable. "
good,Easy going and relaxing job with great discounts.  Great place to work on communicative and customer service skills. All employees are very friendly and helpful.
good,Not sure exactly what Best Buy wants to be. They have managed to survive with omnichannel sales. Just not exactly sure the company is going to be around in 10 years in the same footprint.
good,I think more pay and more training is needed to advance to a better paying position. There are many things that change when you look towards management positions. It's almost impossible to get those positions.
good,It’s ok it’s a place that’s manageable a place good staff that are helpful alright customer service good management and on hand supervisors that help out
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I learned I never want to work a 9-5 at a place like that. My manager and I didn't get along very well which caused a bunch of problems in the workplace.
good,Management was very nice. They do put a huge focus on making money and sales. Sometimes a bit to much cus they want you to sale. It has been a good experience but I would not work there again.
good,"Easy to get hired, I’m-ossicle to rise up. Basically everybody is friends there and only wants to work with their friends. The people are very friendly though."
good,"As an agent of the Geek Squad, I worked in stores. Assisted sales staff on what services to provide customers. I set up the new computers customers purchased and diagnosed issues with computers brought in and offer recommendations."
good,"If you work in sales, you will be stressed to upsell to people who don't have a great amount of leisurely income."
good,"At the time I worked there, they had a cult like drive for add on sales.  They were not and still seem to not be very customer service driven.  Not sure how environment is now."
good,"It's a basic retail job. I enjoyed working with the team I worked with, but theres no way to know coming into it if you'll enjoy your team or management. Not a bad job for a teenager starting out, or as a second job, but definitely not a career."
good,my workplace was very well rounded and had great people working. the people I worked with were very nice and knew how to end up with a happy customer.
good,Community was a good place to be involved in and i had fun with most of my coworkers. Management was iffy and sometimes hypocritical. There is a lot of different areas to work in and you do have the ability to try new things with internal applications.
good,This is a good job while in high school or college. I really can't say much more relevant as I was employed here almost 20 years ago. .................
good,It's a great place to work for teenagers in high school or college students. The opportunity for advancement is very tough. Some people will work for years before a promotion.
good,"the job sucks, but the people who work there are cool, management was very disconnected to their employees, management would always be beefing between other departments in the store"
good,It was one of the better places to work I can't lie if only they would've provided more hours I would've stayed. The pay was ok but then again I was a part time employee.
good,"It was a pretty okay okay, laid back job. But I will say that the managers gives hours to who they favor at the time the most. You’re expected to basically force customers to give them your number or shove the Best Buy credit card down their throat with every purchase. I worked front end and when trying to call for help it was as if I was asking them to commit a crime."
good,I liked my co workers and got along with them but I did not feel like I belonged there and when I was let go I was mad at first but now I feel that it was for the best.
good,"Best Buy's culture is a good one at a high level. The intentions are good, but if the people implementing the culture are not, then you end up with a bitter and diluted version on what the culture could have been"
good,"The interview process was very short, and working there was a good experience over all. The biggest deterrent was the sales pressure that happened. The more you sell, the more hours you were scheduled but as soon as you were not selling as much, the less hours you were scheduled."
good,"learned about computers, tablets and how interact with customers. Great atmosphere and co workers and would go back again. Pay was ok but could have been alot better."
good,was an after school job i was the cashier balanced cash register answered high volume processed returns cleaned the front of the store  during slow times and before closing the store
good,A great place to start your employment experiences.  You get high pressure sales without the added benefits of commissions.  You are held to sales numbers to help increase or justify the hours they schedule you for.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"idéal pour emploie étudiant , saisonnier ou même temps plein."
good,"Your enjoyment of this employer totally depends on the management. went through 3 and enjoyed my time with the company until our last manager i worked under, complete disregard for her subordinates in terms of fair and UNBIASED considerations for certain promotions/lateral movements around the store positions"
good,"a good starter job but nothing else really, you cant really grow and management was poor. The store manager got fired. The other managers were too strict about things."
good,I worked at best buy over twenty years ago and have no idea whether or not it is a good place to work today.  I'm only doing this commentary because i
good,"Very good place to work I"
good,"The company as a whole is a good one to work for. It all comes down to the management team of each store. I have work for the same store for a little more than 3 years. Some managers worked with me and help me grow, others could have careless."
good,Competitive and great at developing their employees. The only issue that can arise is that the work culture can sometimes be controlled by a single person disallowing for a feeling of the team collaborating together to fix inherit issues.
good,I learned what it meant to deliver exceptional customer experience. I learned what customers were looking for when it came to quality of products. I enjoyed every morning having a group huddle to go over where we were in relation to the other stores and the plan for the day.
good,"Offer a diagnostic check on the machine, charge diagnostic check towards the service or total purchase, make the suggestion to offer them to buy a new machine as the previous one will cost more to repair; in comparison, to buying a new one.  Offer to transfer hard drive data and any specified settings to the new machine for a service price.  Offer customer with an extended warranty.  Offer to assist in any purchases they may need or already have in they're possession.  If closing, help with cleaning and throwing out the trash for the morning shift."
good,"Working at Best Buy was an ok experience. The sales team was nice but the work felt like a grind. Training was ok, but more training time would have been good."
good,It has its good an bad as every company does.  The pay was nice but the hours were horrible.  I had no life outside of work and the higher up you move in the company the more hours you work to the point of even on your days off there are 2 to 3 conf calls or meetings to attend.  But good culture and at the time had good opportunities.
good,Not a bad place to work. Online rep. training was pretty good actually. If they paid more i would of never left. the people that worked there were very nice and helpful from start to finish.
good,The people I worked with where awesome. One of the best sales teams I have ever worked with. Even though I do not work there anymore I still keep in touch with a lot of my former coworkers and some of the management team.
good,Ok place to work. I love electronics and Best Buy gave me a chance to work and sell them everyday. At times very fast paced and other times very slow.
good,"Each store can have a completely different feel. Some stores are about unity, helping each other out, and assisting customers/clients. Other stores may have cut-throat employees, management that doesn't act when needed, and an unnatural focus on metrics. Most stores possess qualities from both columns A and B."
good,"If you are looking for something to get you through school, or a temporary job that pays well then Bes By is a good place. There are lot of rumors that spread throughout the whole company."
good,"Working with my co-workers was always fun. We always tried to make the workplace enjoyable to be at, but management was big on playing favorites and treating people differently based on how they felt that day."
good,Everyone that works there is fun but there is no incentive to perform better. Managers are okay but don't motivate their workers to do better. No excitement .
good,"I enjoyed working at best buy and enjoyed my coworkers. The only reason I left is because I needed to go full time to support myself and when I interviewed for a full time position, they did not give it to me, forcing me to quit to find something full time. All coworker felt I should get the position and the person they gave it to was out of favoritism"
good,It was okay for college. Mostly just have to meet their sales goals and get enough people to get credit cards and you will be golden. The job is pretty easy.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,i would upload crates and pack boxes. i was here seasonal. made good money for the hours i was working. days were long. i would start early morning and come out late
good,not boring work. decent employees to be around. however everyone feels like they are your supervisor. alot of micromanaging but if you have thick skin brush it off.
good,"Job was initially fun, but quickly became tedious and with the removal of commission lacked any serious ways of providing employee recognition. Management was constantly changing and failed to provide any real structure. Too much division and poor communication amongst management."
good,Unless you are going for a manager this is just a starting job.  There is little growth opportunities and heaven help you on blackfriday if you have to work the line.
good,It wasn't that great to work out because i was introduced shortly before black friday and wasn't given many hours to train on the floor. Given no help upon the day of black friday weekend as to where any of our sales product were but nonetheless some of my co-workers were great.
good,"Geek Squad installs is a perfectly okay place to work. The hours are static which is great for retail and the coworkers are typically pretty great people. The biggest downsides are the management and the pay. Management does't do a good enough job of keeping clients in the know when it comes down to them and end up leaving the agent out to dry when clients are upset about something out of the agents control. Pay is much better than in the store however once out in the field it seems like they are expecting work to be completed that is out of your pay range, especially when there are others who make more due to their advanced job title for the larger scopes of work but management wants you to do the same work for less pay."
good,You must be a very competitive and skilled worker. Be on time to work and be consistent with your 2work. In this environment you will learn how to deal with different attitudes and mindsets
good,"They have the tools to help you really get a grip for sales. there isn't a ton of pressure if you don't do great from the start."
good,Job wasn't crazy awesome but had good management and staff were helpful to one another. The job can get stressful at times but provides good work opportunity.
good,"balance tills for registers"
good,"I worked in the Geek Squad and the staff were great. The worst part, unfortunately were the customers. In my experience, it didn't matter what the problem was with the customer's computer it was my fault. It just takes a toll being yelled at all day for things you have no control over."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work. It provided me with lots of work experience for later jobs as well as helped me with my future goals by providing tuition reimbursement. I would recommend working at Best Buy to anybody who likes technology and wants to gain valuable work experience and workplace skills, all while receiving top notch benefits."
good,Everyone is very helpful and willing to assist. There are many opportunities to move up in BestBuy as well. Flexible hours and understanding managers.
good,"Management needs to be changed, left that place because manager had too many favorite employees who could get off the hook from everything. Once you give your 2 weeks, management treats you like you were nothing."
good,It was a nice place to work. I just needed a job closer to home and better to work with my new family.  You can learn and grow there and they are willing to help with that.
good,"It was alright, I did not get as many hours as id like. The chance to be hired full time seemed impossible. The Hours were okay, once you get used to waking up at 4:00 a.m."
good,I enjoyed working here and I didn't have a complaint in my years of service at the corporation. I would recommend this company to anyone willing to work in a tech company.
good,"Best Buy is an okay place to work.  It's best for people transitioning from college to a steady full-time job. The discounts aren't that good ether.  However, depending on the department, one could get discounts/commission.  One can also learn about computer, drones, and other gadgets in the store."
good,"they do not care about you, it's not really terrible but no matter how good a worker you are you are ultimately expendable especially in the first 90 days"
good,shark tank like its a commission based job but it is not pay is good only if you are a young kid in college not much room to move up just was not very happy with best buy as a company
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"very sales oriented and in some departments you were put at a disadvantage. my main reason for working there was they paid above the minimum wage, and their discount for employees was awesome."
good,This is a great place if you have flexible hours and can be scheduled at any time. They will work with your school schedule for the most part. The management is a little lackluster but the discounts and co-workers make up for the disorganization.
good,"No commission = No incentive for sales associates"
good,"it was a good time, only seasonal though, manager had told me they would hire me as part time and they never did So I'm a bit disappointed in that area."
good,"Best Buy is typical retail. They feed you BS about caring for the customer but change programs that benefit the customer to be more beneficial to the company and then want you to lie to the customer to get them to purchase the program. The hours were terrible, the goals were unrealistic (especially with the change in the programs) and upper management were simply looking for ""yes men"" rather than ideas that could improve the company."
good,"It's a good first or second job even, but as far as advancement and raises, it isn't good. It takes a long time to be recognized and you have to be fully dedicated."
good,"Non commission sales, however depending on traffic you will assist other departments. Learned about cellular plans and cellular technology. Team culture is great."
good,Decent place to work at.  Would recommend to try to work for Geek Squad if you want to take a more technical route.  You will definitely learn the products and services.
good,"The job was ok. The pay was not good. They constantly pushed employees to perform like salaried employees. However, we were not paid on salary. Little motivation."
good,"It's not bad really. It just depends on how things turn out."
good,"It’s a interesting working environment "
good,"Nice Environment, many opportunities to succeed if liked by management. Team Oriented environment the hours would work well for someone who is single or in school but, it would be pretty hard to maintain a family in my opinion and work at best buy. Especially during the holidays and how America has amped up Black Friday."
good,fun at first then it went downhill due to new management. It was my longest job and I did meet and learn a lot about modern day technologies and how people look into new products.
good,I worked for NCO who was subcontracted by Best Buy. I took Best Buy calls and helped with ordering and helping people with what they wanted. I was not very confident on the products because I am not a very computer or technical person. We had to up sale on every call and I am not a pushy person so I had issues with this.
good,"A competitive and at times fast-paced work environment. Can learn alot about customer service no matter which department you work in."
good,Working there could go one of two ways; most days were slow-paced and others could be hectic. I gained product knowledge and sells skills. The workplace culture could improve.
good,"A good place to work if you're straight out of high school.  The Metairie location 572 is not willing to hire full time, so if you're looking for a full time position this location may not be for you."
good,"Demanding, and the team leader/managers don't really care about your own well being. Injured my back, but they still made me work, even though my doctor told me not to do anything physically demanding."
good,"The job was rewarding in some way, otherwise it was ok. I felt the manager of the department not supportive.The workplace culture was  accepting. I learned all about appliances."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was a seasonal part-time. The benefits could be better. it is only 5%, however, you can buy on the clock. There were long hours, a lot of times without notice."
good,The management they have here in Tuscaloosa at the store I’m located at is horrible and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. The coworkers and the atmosphere was fun as long as the GM was gone.
good,"It was an OK environment to work in.  If you know your products you can sell a lot of merchandise.  Customer base was good and had a steady flow, management took care of us"
good,"Not a bad campus, overall pretty ok work culture. Always handled work life balance well, but suffers from the same issues as nearly all large companies, which is excess training."
good,The job was ok. the pay was horrible. managament was ok. A lot is expected of you during the busy hours of the year. It kind of stressful environment during chritsmas
good,Coworkers are great and customers are sweet. Best Buy teaches you different traits to help you succeed. Management is hit or miss depending on the location.
good,The day I stared they had me do online tests and watch videos. these were surprisingly effective. The hands on training was lack luster do to the employees not really being motivated.
good,"It was ok, you don't get what you put in. Manager usually benefited from your sales goals more than you did. But if you're a high school kid or a college student its is a great first job."
good,"If you are working for Best Buy or considering it in the future, I strongly recommend you think twice! discrimination and favoritism is a huge problem. The workers are so rude too."
good,Did not like my new manager did not have the same family feel so i left on good terms. I loved opening the moore location but after management changed the storr feel changed
good,a lot of drama between the workers and mangers. managers choose the people they like the most and promote them and move the rest in positions that they arent so good at and move them around until they find a good department for them.
good,"I would go back to the company...My time there was alright, it wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible either. I learned a lot about technology since I was in P.C  Sales. The knowledge has benefitted me to this day. I appreciate they hired me when they did at that time and continue to shop and be a loyal BBY customer as well. "
good,"BestBuy, working fast paced, some career advancement, Learned many things, workplace environment is normal depends on management and coworkers, hardest part of the job is to get hours, the most enjoyable part of the job is the discount, and branding."
good,I had a good time working at Best Buy over all I worked in 3 stores in 3 different cities and each one were a little different. the Phx location was a great location but the manager there was terrible he was a micro manager and basically made you do it his way and if you didn't he was almost near yelling at you like your a baby and make you not want to do anything. SV city was a different experience I got promoted and got a raise so I loved it in the little city store. then I transferred to Denver where I ws there only a few more months but had a good experience there too
good,It was a decent job that offered enough hours. During the holiday they wanted me to work from 10pm to 6am. They offered me a different position but I desired an office job rather than retail because it would have more predictable hours and play better with my school hours.
good,"Good workplace, but School was overwhelming. Needed more time for myself, schedule was getting too busy. Clock in, meet customers, conversation and make sales transactions."
good,"Best Buy is an easy place to work but dont get stuck there. its a friendly environment, but it working there wont get you enough money to raise a family or create future investment unless your planning to move up to management."
good,"This was a great fit for me.  I enjoyed helping individuals put their media area together.  Offering extensive information suggestions and facts, it gave customers confidence in their purchase."
good,"Overall working at Best Buy is a fairly laid-back and relaxed job, but like any retail position it demands far too much sacrifice of personal time and well-being for far too little pay.  It requires that to hold any full-time position you will never get to see your weekends or holidays ever again.  The work is generally enjoyable, but sometimes you feel pressured to sell insurance policies to people that don't want them.  The management at my store is generally very good, but corporate management is very distant and unaware of real problems at a store level and what should be done about them."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This was a great job while I was in high school. Much better that fast food or many other part time jobs that a high school kid can work. I am still friends with may of the people I worked with back in the day.
good,It was a pretty straightforward job. Pushing the Insurance plans and warranties was rather taxing but they will strongly emphasize you must do this to be successful.
good,"Unfortunately you sell thousands and thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with absolutely no commission or bonus compensation what so ever. There is blue crew bucks bonuses, but the only way to get it is for every department in the whole store to hit goal. So your department could hit goal and every other department every single month but if one misses then you won’t get the bonus."
good,"Good Management & Culture"
good,Workplace culture is good but job growth opportunities within the company are limited. The store I worked at was in a smaller more rural part of the country and the policies and procedures Best Buy has set up do not function very well in that area.
good,I work as a repair agent for geek squad. The work is very basic but it's a good start. They pay is ok for what your doing but it could be better. Other companies do pay more for the same role.
good,"Best Buy overall is an ok company to work for. You have greats benefits with the company once you become a full time employee. The downside of company is that you have to know someone for any type of advancement. I’ve been full time at Best Buy for over three years applied to move up in the company 5 times at various stores and the locations I have worked, and I’ve never been promoted to the next level. Management is very biased and promote and give raises to the people they want even if they aren’t a great employee."
good,Great place to start you career in IT. You can develop you customer service and supports skills. Fast paced environment and some stressful. Geek Squad culture is laid back.
good,working at best buy you're trained in your department so you must know what you're talking about then talking to customers. Even if that means that you're studying about the product outside of the store.
good,"As an employee in a District based role I had the opportunity to work in multiple locations and with the many departments within the store."
good,"I learned a lot about customer sales techniques, planograms, merchandising, and down stocking.  I enjoyed the overnights and the gaming hardware launches"
good,Read the title. Good for college kids smart enough to help people get the right electronics. Not really a long term career option unless you move into upper management quickly.
good,"I started off part time and worked my way up after graduation. The hours were flexible based upon if they like you or not.  You received more hours if they liked you, not so may if not.  I chose to relocate upon changing employers.  Of course, this is a small town."
good,After working for the company for 5 years I would say that over the years there was a shift in management style. I enjoyed working for the company and would go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,I like it their but it will depend on the management of your location. Personally mine sucked but you really rolled the dice. Pay was okay but it was better then other stores.
good,"Good starting job with advancement at the store level. Part time, and full time positions are both good to have and you can advance within the store.  Advancement to corp or to upper mgt is difficult."
good,"Seasonal work selling computers, not a bad job, it is what got me interested in technical work, however it was not a career.  If you need some work, it is one of the better retail outlets to work at."
good,It has been many years since I worked for Best Buy.  At the time I felt you needed to be part if the in group for advancement  The culture is very close and outside looking in requires some work to be a part.
good,no job security and rude higher ups pay was horrible they didn't care about the employee  I don't have anything else to type..so Im just filing this up with letters so I can get to the next screen.  DO NOT WORK HERE!
good,"It's a good job to get your foot into something if you're going to school and want some extra money, but little career advancement generally speaking."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,its a ok job  if the store is located in a area that don't have a lot of people to buy then you wont be able to get raises because of the store revenue even though your department might be excelling
good,"decent place to work (at the time). Great for youth, if going to school. however cant maintain a family on the wage.Career advancment is medicore, good discounts."
good,"After the closure of all Future Shop locations in Canada, I found myself out of work. After a brief period on Employment Insurance, I found employment with Best Buy Canada for the exact position I held at Future Shop. Because they were the same company, I had already all of the necessary experience and knowledge to be a gainful employee and team member. I did not find the experience to be equivalent however; an over-bearing management system and lack of commission on sales lead me to find work elsewhere."
good,"Supervisor duties daily game plan project numbers and trends business plan,schedule personal.Stock,inventory sales training and culture.  Ability to be independent and autonomous. Great staff at my time of employment."
good,Working at bestbuy is fine. Its retail. I worked in the warehouse and was expected to stay late into the night working at the store. Always understaffed.
good,"Good communication skills "
good,I was challenged from customers to figure out each small problems they had with their computers. I learned how to fix every problem through doing with own independant research.
good,"overall is a good job for someone looking for part time work, had little to no issues with management besides the GM but he no longer works there. Individuals that you work with are usually pretty cool."
good,"-Employees can be fun"
good,"Depending upon the work you do or the management team, one's experiences may vary. In the store I worked promises were made, but those that did promise never fulfilled them. "
good,was a decent job.. management wasn't the best but that's with any sales type position.. they only care about numbers. coworkers made the days better. wouldn't really go back unless they paid me double
good,"I didn't have a problem working here. I just like busier types of work. I would often find myself having nothing to do during the day. I was never scheduled more than 20 hours a week and I ended up moving, so I had to quit."
good,"Working here, has been both stressful and overwhelming, but I met some of the best people I know. Work days vary with the managers, but the people you meet make it worth it. Helping customers get what they need, rather than what's expensive is nice, but it doesn't really feel like it's rewarded in the store. I often found myself not meeting sales targets when I helped my customers, rather than objectify them and forcing them to buy things they can't afford, and make them apply for a credit card they don't need."
good,"-Great place to establish your ""Rhythm""."
good,Just kind of the same thing over and over again but overall was quite the experience although the training can be much but also very useful and the people are fun
good,"Its a good way to interact with customers and to learn a lot from everyone and also improving one's communication skills."
good,Lots of changes. Was there during layoffs. No communication. Great place for work home balance. I worked there almost 15 years. The offices are in Richfield.
good,"Working at Geek Squad was exciting and full of opportunities to learn, with the caveat that you still work in a retail environment. Even as a repair technician I was required to push certain sales goals. Compared to other retail companies Geek Squad pays really well, but compared to similar help desk positions... not so much. Geek Squad culture is really fun if you like to get into it, but you'd be one of few as very few people like to bring it up. After seeing multiple technicians leave for better paying jobs and coming back to visit - the Geek Squad is way overworked for the pay."

After seeing multiple technicians leave for better paying jobs and coming back to visit - the Geek Squad is way overworked for the pay."
good,The only thing that bothered me about working at Best Buy was as a college student it is difficult to get enough hours into your paycheck. There were very few full-time employees and more part-time employees which made it hard to be able to pay for things and go to school at the same time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I like best buy I just wish we had more fun while being the best. I feel like all managers are to uptight about hitting numbers but lose sight at having a good time.
good,"The days could get long, but they were enjoyable."
good,I really enjoyed the work i was doing and stayed with the company for quite a long time however towards the end i was not getting the hours i needed in comparison to the amount of work and dedication i was putting into the job.
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work, but managers were mediocre at best, awful at worst. Many did not respect that family came first for employees. Coworkers were usually alright, but at times they would not pull their weight and it made it difficult for the rest of us. Some were absolutely fantastic though."
good,"Great place to work, staff was friendly as well  Overtime was always available and the overall job was low key and stress free, provided with autonomy, no complaints"
good,Best Buy taught me a lot about customer service and problem solving. This job helped me build confidence when speaking to customers and the workplace environment was healthy.
good,I think Best Buy is the best place Ive ever worked. I Have loved all the mangers and they treat everyone well. I am frustrated with the lack of advancement. I have worked for Best Buy for over 3 years with no movement. The work/life balance does suck as there is no set schedule. Hardest part of the day is defiantly dealing with customers. Not all customers are bad and not all customers are great. Most enjoyable part is knowing that people leave the store happy.
good,nice location it was close to my house. I was there for a few years but they lay off all the time. You need a degree if your working in an office but the field no.
good,A fun and fast-paced work environment. A place to continually learn and evolve from shifts in culture that directly tie into everyday life. I was happy to work there.
good,"was a vpl and was treated not as good as i would like to have been, the benifits where amazing. i had to help customers with att products and only that as i was paid by att. but was forced to walk around and help out when  i needed to be working on selling att"
good,la capacitacion es sobre la marcha no tienes tiempo para asumirlo
good,"you work like a slave with little to no growth in the company, promotions come from who you know not how hard you work. the people are fun but i wouldnt work here if you wanted to move up"
good,"Management is decent, the pay is way too low for the amount of hours and the amount of sales you make. They need to have some type of commission there."
good,They made sure we had fun on certain occasions. Even had a Turkey Bowl football on Thanksgiving. And they did feed you here and their. Great support system.
good,"You must interact with various customers, many impatient and some uninformed about technology. It gives you a chance to inform those whom do not enjoy learning about technology on their own and puts you in the driver seat to help them get what they need to make their home life more enjoyable."
good,"I found the job to be very competitive, Something that I didn't expect. but then again it is sales. The managers micromanage you. This job would be ideal for a very energetic person who loves to interact with people but also have a lot of patience. They are very strict on reaching your quota."
good,I learned a lot of level 1 troubleshooting while working for Geek Squad. The calls and opportunities to work with users was substantial. I managed my own schedule time
good,"good company"
good,"It was a good job"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Was part time in order to receive discounts. I assume it is like any other retail position. Although, at the squad there is much more customer facing."
good,typical day included taking care of client needs with their technology.  For some it meant getting them paired up with a sales associate and helping them get new technology to make their lives better.
good,"A typical day consists of me working with clients in order to build the proper solution that they require based on their needs and to talk about what's possible with them depending upon which section of my department they are in. I am the person that everyone in the store looks to when they have a Smart Home question (Portable Audio, Networking, Security Systems, Smart Home Assistants and Automation). My main qualms with the store come with upper management and some of the entry level management. While they certainly are able to talk about Best Buy's culture and creating the best solutions by enriching people's lives with technology, they do not always back this up. My store runs rampant with favoritism, unfortunately, which ultimately ends up hurting team morale. My favorite part of the job, however, is each interaction with every single client. There has never been a time where I have not enjoyed showing people what exactly is possible with technology."
good,"Upper management is constantly changing, lower level employees are often expandeable during a restructure. Jobs have been outsourced as of recent years."
good,"Very fun place to work, family environment , nice hours, and treated you fairly. Totally enjoyed my stint there and learned a lot from everyone dealing with the tech world."
good,Awesome job. Plenty of room for advancement if you're interested  in a promotion. Hours are flexible but also vary depending on need for workers. Would recommend as a part-time job.
good,"You were forced to sell magazines and service/replacements to every customer even if they didn't want them. When it was busy it was busy, but there was also a lot of slow times too."
good,very flexible not enough pay. Open almost every holiday. The tuition reimbursement is good bonus as well as the benefits. employee discount was a plus too.
good,"As a whole, the company is fine. It's a competitive environment and will keep you on your toes. If you're going to work there I would suggest you enjoy tech. It makes the job a lot more fun."
good,Great place to work unless it is during theholidays. Management over looks scheduling and doesnt take into consideration how much you are working or over working.
good,"It was alright the hours were ok and the pay was alright its a good place to work and learn new things, the workers there are friendly and some what easy to get along with"
good,"Best Buy corporate HQ is a sprawling crowded place that reminds me of the campus of a large University, if the University was mostly attended by males over 30."
good,"✓	SWAT Inventory Specialist ensures inventory integrity in the store through a variety of inventory adjustments and data collection tools. "
good,Best Buy is rebuilding a culture in which they want to see their employees succeed and grow within the company. It has been a great stepping stone for many people who want to venture off into higher sales positions or the technology sector.
good,"I was my own boss, but was responsible enough to get the work done, it wasn't rigid with my hours if I was running late because of kids that wasn't a problem."
good,Overall they offer decent benefits good pay and a good discount. Work life balance is horrible. Some leadership prefer to turn the other cheek rather than help or take action when necessary.
good,I liked working with Best Buy because everyone was a team. They were always nice and made you feel welcome. I really enjoyed working for them. They treated me fairly.
good,I am often happy to see my co workers when I come to work. They always seem to make the job fun. I also love the job itself because i am good at it and like to see things organized and presentable.
good,"Great culture, everyone is there to do their job, and do it well. Solid discounts."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Walk in. Clock in. Unload truck. Organize and unbox merchandise. Put on sales floor. Go and put in on the shelves. Clean up. Clock out. "
good,I used to love going to work but under the new management not so much. They have their favorites and they don't seem to look at seniority or hard work.
good,Great place to work. Gained a great deal amount of knowledge. Never had any complaints working here. Overall good. Managment and supervisors are great help. always there for you.
good,what can I say best buy is an ok job to work at depending on the location. a typically day going to work was ok depending on who was the manager was k
good,"Great place to work! However, the hours were very sporadic and never the same."
good,It was a good job when I was there but as I was leaving they brought in new management and made the position unbearable.  It was good while I was there.
good,"always about hitting your numbers even though you are not commission. "
good,"Seasonal for 3 months, 10 to 12 hour long days and immediately cut me off after Christmas with no warning or contact from them. Not having to deal with customers was a plus and will get you good familiarity with the store layout"
good,"Fun place to start your career in the country."
good,The store I worked with had very friendly individuals. A few I knew from going to school or have met which made it easier to fit in. I enjoyed working at best buy.
good,Decent job while going to College.They worked around my School Schedule. Was a fairly easy job. Minus the Corporate Retail Culture. Not too bad though.
good,"fun"
good,"Environnement très technophile, mais la philosophie de l'entreprise ne cadre pas avec la mienne"
good,"They had many changes in management and structure changes during my time there, I would have no experience that would benefit a review. I see no reason I would need to review them as my time was a long while ago."
good,"Overall a nice environment- as I worked in the Geek Squad as an ARA (Advanced Repair Agent).  I loved the work I did, but we were extremely underpaid and had to deal with a lot of negative clientele. "
good,management wasn't the greatest when it came to customer complaints but the work environment and people were good. In general a decent place for a first job.
good,"The benefits were commensurate with the work, and they offer a lot of professional development opportunities.  The company invests in it's staff and strives toward their success."
good,"I worked for best buy 23 years ago, so my experiences there are no longer relavent. I enjoyed working there, but it is not the same company anymore, so it should not count."
good,"Company was highly fast paced, engaging and competitive. Managers expected high sales expectations. Close relationships with other employees is a must to succeed in this environment. Pay does not compensate for the difficulty of the work done but overall the company is pretty fun to work for. Have fun while being the best."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Too much focus on metrics, need to focus on customer and needs. Credit Cards are pushed mercilessly at customers. Culture need to be focused on the customers needs not metrics. Management Team was great."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for 5 years in different positions ultimately becoming a Geek Squad agent. It was really fun, the people are great, management wasn't too bad, the only reason I left was because I was Part Time and the hours were cut drastically. After I left the position I had was restructured and didn't exist anymore."
good,Working at best buy will help you become a better salesman and talker. Hours are scares whenever its not holiday season. Management is sometimes too harsh and unrealistic with goals. They often act childish.
good,"Best buy has great values and ideas, plus all the awesome technology to learn about (and buy with a discount).  However, moving into leadership isn't the best experience I've had.  Depending on the level of management you are in, theres typically a lot more responsibility than the job title calls for."
good,Best Buy is a fantastic place to work for a younger person that does not have a family.  The company culture is amazing.  The hours for management can be long and expectations can at times be unrealistic.
good,Focused on customer selling and relations. Managers want to package additional items with customer purchases such as ink with printers or protection plans and tech service plans with computers.
good,"overall fine experience, did not mind working there. some days were longer than others but that is expected in the workplace. Would recommend to anyone looking for work."
good,Company has no work life balance. They will work you as many hours as they can. they expect you to deal with it and when you schedule time off you are looked at as no team player
good,i would like to work at game stop because i love video games ever since i was a kid .ware house i can do because i'm a hard worker and the pay is good.
good,"• Being promoted in my first work from a Market Expert position to a Controller."
good,"Overall a fun place to work and start out. The company is really focused on functioning as a team which is nice, but not all members that works are obviously team players."
good,I dont really remember what it was like working at Best Buy. I remember the people who i worked with were always helpful and nice. I needed the extra money at that time and it served its purpose.
good,Work is usually start with checking what pricing needs to change for the day. Then I would check what planograms are assigned for the week and what needs to be finished by the end of the day. Then after making sure planograms are set I would downstock the store which involves checking empty product areas in the store and finding the missing product.
good,Overall not too bad.  Got to learn new things about installations.  Coworkers were alright.  Becomes kind of repetitive after a while.  Busier during big sports seasons particularly for TV installations and such.
good,The environment was always positive and I enjoyed the people I worked with. I was able to learn and integrate new systems I never knew before. I learned a lot about the sales side of a company.
good,"It's been over four years, I don't really remember anything about best buy besides how I left which wasn't on purpose, they just never scheduled me again."
good,"Overall, Best Buy was a decent place to work PART TIME. The compensation is not great and, for most, falls below the standard for similar corporations. The work can be rewarding, but management is driven more by achieving favorable sales statistics than the welfare and morale of their employees, which can make a long, slow shift genuinely disheartening."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Lots of people work at Best Buy for the outstanding employee discount. Opportunity to advance if you have the right skillset. Great for anyone that doesn't mind minimum wage. Entry-level sales experience.
good,was not there long did not have many hrs . whenever I started working there I was helped a lot and had a good floor management but i was not satisfied with the hours I was given to work .
good,There was not a lot if recognition for the hard work that we gave. There was so much that a manager had to do and it would take you years to advance in the work.
good,Best Buy was for the most part an enjoyable place to work. There was non commission so it was less stressful to continue with sales with customers. I worked in the appliance department for many years and had wonderful co workers and a great department manager. I proceeded to customer service department where it was a little more stressful in dealing with upset customers. But my ability to calm the customers was very helpful.
good,Meeting new people everyday was refreshing but having goals based around services and credit card offers gets annoying. Flexible work hours except for Oct-Dec but thats expected in retail.
good,"It was a good job to have while I finished school. It taught me a lot about sales, and how to cater to your customers. Overall a good job for someone starting out in sales."
good,i replenished the store with merchandise. i made sure the store was full of product. set signs for each ad. replenishment of the entire store.management was alright.
good,"The Job was decent I enjoyed my hours as well as the coworkers and head supervisors ,I can truely say it was a learning experience from customers to merchandise."
good,You work with at least 10-15 customers a day in a regular full time shift depending on how busy your store is. Your co-workers can make or break the store.
good,All the mangers do is promote who they like if you want to move up you better hope you're related to someone ot they like you. Besides the favortisim I do enjoy working at BestBuy the workload isn't too much beisdes when it's around Christmas time.
good,Best Buy 829 leadership at the time I was working was completely biased. Leadership would only give opportunities to those who were friends with leadership and would not give fair raises nor promotions. They did not understand people who had medical needs or who had children.
good,"management was inconstant, but overall a good place to work. Management seemed to worry more about customers and less about daily goals, this is for upper management who's sole focus is daily sales projections which are based on previous years. Deal with customers as they are currently, and not based on what they might buy."
good,"If you are looking for a solid retail job, Best buy is probably up there. It has its downsides, but I can't think of a better chain when it comes to discount, training, work environment, and flexibility of schedule. Recommended for those in school"
good,Typical retail work environment. Not sure of current benefits and pay as I am no longer employed there. Retirement benefits and stock options were offered when I was here.
good,"good stepping stone, depending on the store you work at will depend on how management is how the hours are and how busy the traffic will be. expect long hours expect to get called in and its retail so black friday"
good,"Best Buy is nice place to work no doubt but if anyone wants to get a stable career its not the place s/he should go for. The employee accommodation is good but compare to hourly rate the stress is really high since end of the day you will be evaluated by numbers. On top of that, the duties are very much repetitive therefore though your number or performance is good but to some extent it makes people monotonous. However, the most bad thing working in Best Buy is that there is no career growth!"
good,"Best Buy is full of smart, achiever-type personalities. There are a lot of great groups of people at Best Buy, but there are the occasional bad group that you can get associated with. When that happens, it's no fun. If you don't get into one of those bad groupss it can be very rewarding. There isn't a ton of training for managers to manage people. They're great at their actual work, but a lot of times, not great at developing people. Again, this probably depends on which department you're in."
good,"Clock in, go to your area, work, communicate with management with the progress of your area. Maintain cleanses and items are where they should be. "
good,"I only worked here seasonally but it was a decent job, got to meet a lot of people. Need some decent sales experience to move product and not have people go else where to buy"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Tasks and responsibilities remained constant and outside management and care rarely occurred. Co-workers were hard workers, and were clearly committed to making best-buy a better place."
good,"you can not really trust the management team. "
good,"fast paced"
good,"Best Buy offers quite a few benefits but there is also a lot that has to be dealt with in order to receive them. Like most jobs, multitasking is highly suggested so I would recommend this a start up job."
good,"Pleasant Hill, Ca "
good,The transformation Best Buy has made over the past five years is amazing.  Customer focused services are challenging and a clear focus of their future.
good,They give a lot of automation over to the driver. This was years ago and it may not be applicable anymore. This information seems to be necessary to enter.
good,Great company to work for if you are willing to put in the hours.  Good benefits and great atmosphere.  Training is great and prepares you for your next position.
good,"If you're looking for a good entry level position in a technology field, this is it. It's very easy to build good relationships with people there, but at the same time, it's rough to work there. Personally, I was never 100% taught how to do my job in a ""hands-on"" manner. I was thrown into the mix and was told to sell. At the location I worked at, while I had good relationships with the managers, they were never truly helpful in a lot of situations. I had gotten reprimanded for not knowing how to perform two different transactions that I had never been taught how to do by my lead manager who was supposed to teach us how to do those transactions. Working in customer service was definitely not an easy task at all. However, I did learn some very valuable life skills that will help me later on in life as well, such as how to deal with an angry person in an efficient manner, how to talk to people with more confidence, and how to build efficient workplace relationships. There is too much pressure to sell however, considering Best Buy is a non-commissioned workplace. Members of the sales staff are pushed to sell services and warranty to clients and customers, and often as a result, come off as pushy to the purchaser."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"management wasn't that great when I worked for geek squad, but work was easy and steady and always something to do. the people that worked there is what really makes the job enjoyable."
good,Best Buy is one of the best companies to work for! Made connections with coworkers and customers alike! Never a dull moment on the sales floor! Being able to come into work everyday doing what I loved to do made the job enjoyable!
good,"I worked there as a teenager I was actually a junior in Highschool but had to end my short stint to focus on grades but all in all, I liked the experience as well as all the people I encountered I even met a few higher up's and an MLB player for Astros"
good,Met a lot of people good and bad. Probably wouldn't go back. Didn't schedule me enough hours so I ended up having to leave. Also they want you to really try to sell geek squad protection which is really annoying.
good,"Everyone I worked with at Best Buy was very friendly and easy going. I learned a lot more about technology than I knew before working there. In the warehouse I learned a lot about what goes on behind the scenes to make sure we kept the store tidy and in order throughout the day. The managers and supervisors there where super friendly and easy going as well, they understood you when you had something going on. The culture was great. Everyone got along and when we had team events they where usually something very fun and interesting. Hardest part about the job was probably the warehouse and moving all the big appliances around. What I really enjoyed about Best Buy was the people I worked with, it was always a fun but productive time."
good,"Was a fun and vibrant experience. Clean dress code that boosts ego in a professional manner. Excellent training services. I feel like the wages could be better, but overall I worked with great people which makes it very bearable."
good,"This was a fun job where I learned a lot about new products in the tech world however the General Manager didn't know how to speak to people correctly, customers and employees."
good,"Great management they're always Helpful, but some of the leads can Learn a little more about  team work and being respectful to there associates instead of treating them like whatever."
good,can be a great place to work but as with most retail it depends on location and management. I reccomend talking to employees before deciding on a location.
good,A lot of customer interaction.  Faced paced during holidays and weekends.  Hardest part of the job was trying to overcome unhappy or upset customers and find the best solution for them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationship with repeat customers over several years and having them ask for you by name when they come into the store.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"You will see everything working this job and learn some of the most important life skills that everyone could use in life. I did everything from clean out a compactor, unload a truck, put products on the floor, act as a sales associate, get products from the back, deliver products to peoples cars, and fulfill online orders... all in one work day."
good,its was a good work place to work with best buy it was the part time hours and was the problem. It wasn't enough hours me at the I need them. My co workers was have cool and nice too me. I miss working with them.
good,"Work compensation when being recruited could be better, but those who have someone working in the field would get paid better and are advanced higher lot quicker than others. The management is all over the place from time to time, and no one knows what to do at some times."
good,"You get around minimum wage and it's non commission but the supervisors and managers expect so much from you. My coworkers were fun and you get a discount, apart from that it's not the best place to work. Although, you do get lots of good customer experience because it's super busy and you deal with all types of people at Best Buy."
good,"I have been working at Best Buy full-time (More than 5 years)"
good,"I have been with Best Buy for a little less than a year now and everything about the place is great except for a few things. Number one people abuse status 100% within best buy and there's nothing you'll be able to do about it. The schedule is absurd and shifts are never the same and constantly change each week. Working part-time if you even get 1 shift a week you're lucky on some occasions. Also, they are unable to give sufficient shifts for people to live off of but still hire more employees to further make the issue worse. The pay is nice but you don't work enough to ever make any money once they fix this issue then it would be a more admirable place to work at! Lastly, they think that just giving you a raise and once again not giving you anymore working time will keep you happy but it is impossible to live off of there paychecks."
good,"Productive Workplace"
good,Worked there years ago. Cant really remember what it was like. I was a teenager working there. I do remember fun times meeting new customers. Competitive.
good,"Best buy is a corporation focused around customer service.  Some of the technological things they have such as computers and more are supplemented by Total Tech Support and more for your needs.  The Sales atmosphere is good and productive, but can be severely limited by management.  Some managers prefer to only hire their own internally, so if you come from another store expect to work hard to try to fit in."
good,Can be fun but like many big box stores they are being killed off by the internet. Geek Squad was fun and always busy because people are always breaking their stuff.
good,"Great as entry level sales, but don't plan on staying a while. All managers play favorites and steer customers to specific sales people, I have even seen some say that certain sales people pulling $11k sales was not attributed to that particular salesperson."
good,"The hours are inconsistent but the work is pretty chill, and the discount is amazing. The team is very friendly and nice to work with, and they are eager to teach you new things"
good,"Go in and sell your department "
good,"I liked working at Best Buy when they were at 75 carter drive in Edison. We moved to a new location in Perth Amboy where as management got weak. People started stealing, calling out, and the performance of the distribution made us lose our bounces."
good,"If you are in to technology and are natural socialite then this job would fit you well.  "
good,"Best buy is a great place to work for anyone who interested in learning about new tech coming out for the average consumer, but lacks in actually teaching you hands on about any new tech. The average day consisted of meeting with your department lead, inform them of your goals for the day, then you were on your own two feet to meet the goals. One of the best things that best buy offers is the opportunity to be around all sorts of technology and interact with people of all skills levels interested in the same field, every day was different and while you job was to teach the customers and sell them a correct product often times it was a learning experience for the rep."
good,It’s a okay company overalll. I think it can be better for us ten beacuse the period polenta that are there in the management aren  That understanding
good,"indifferent wish there was more hours. other than that it was decent. cant really complain too much in all honesty. the discounts are cool,  but the hours really do suck."
good,"Management needs to communicate with staff much better. I was a seasonal employee and didn't know I was let go until I couldn't log into the system anymore, never had a performance evaluation, training was little to none you basically had to teach yourself your position, only provided computer training not fully pertaining to actual position. Management at times would talk behind employees back to other employees about their performance."
good,Job helped me with learning things in leadership also was able to travel and learn a lot about certain technology and networking. being around new tech was the best part of the job
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The management was power hungry but were able to give you as many hours as you needed if you were on their good side. They pay was starting out at $10/hr.
good,"Mondays and Thursdays are ""white goods days"" in the warehouse. this means that there is a shipment of TV's to be received as well as unloaded counted, and put away by whoever is working inventory those days. Wednesdays and Fridays are ""Brown goods days"" where there is a huge shipment of 3000 pieces or more being broken down, sorted, and put away by a team of around 5 people. other than that duties include shipping and receiving online orders from UPS, USPS, FEDEX, XPO, and Office Depot, as well as carryouts, downstocking, researching shrink, maintaining product status and license plates, as well as supporting the sales team."
good,"I worked here during the holiday season of 2016 as asset protection. Overall, it was a nice place to work. Asset protection consists of being a greeter and observing CCTV for any instances of theft, when noticed, you can engage the customer and contact the police for theft. At the North Aurora location, I had very few instances of people trying to steal."
good,Not the place to stay long term but a good first job to learn from.  It was a great place to makes friends and connect with future business contacts.  Ok pay.
good,"worked part-time for about 2 years in home theater department. Pretty relaxed atmosphere."
good,"It's a retail environment and there were many demands placed on all channels. It has been so long since I worked there, I'm sure many things have changed."
good,"The Company is a great company to work for.  The culture is one that values the staff and believes in each persons ability to bring their special value to the table.  "
good,"The management is good."
good,working for bestbuy is very stressful the managers put extreme pressure on employees to sell their geek squad protection. If you do not sell at least 13% they write you up. The other team members for the most part are the ones the make the company worth working for.
good,The company has under gone a complete over haul since I was there. As I have learned from ppl who stuck around it is much better now. I hope that is true. It was a hard day of working the floor with some many eyes on you all day and a never ending push to sell everything at any cost... even to lie...
good,"Un job parmi tant d'autre dans le détail, rien de remarquable."
good,"Good start to work but to further career was not happening. The stretch assignments to ""become"" work above my pay grade. Little to no recognition for working there and being top sales in my department for 2 years."
good,"Very inconsistent workdays and hours. Pushy Sales goals for the people working the registers or in the wireless departments. Pressure to contact customers, knowing they aren't interested in your assistance."
good,"Cool fun place to work, fun to work there, yeah it was fun to work there, I had fun working there, discount was cool too, super cool discount. It was cool"
good,"Enjoyed my time at BestBuy. Met wonderful people, great for networking. Typical retail ups and downs. Room for advancement if wanted. Lots of opportunity."
good,"Nice job and really good training programs. Very good discount and benefits depending on what you are looking for. The job varies from store to store mostly, management at the store I was at wasn't the best."
good,I enjoyed my job at best buy as it gave me the opportunity to excel in my career in management and accountancy. Your job and success at Best Buy falls in your own hands. You”ll get what you put in! Hard work will pay off! Keep selling or Best Buy terms “happy selling”
good,"The management really determines your experience with the company. All in all, its a good part-time job for a high school or college aged student. I don't really see that much room for advancement at the retail centers."
good,"It was a great place to work during college.  If you have any interest in electronics, it makes the job easy.  Plus you used to get good discounts.  They also provide you some scheduling availability."
good,"Pay was decent, but hours were low.  Store is holding onto an old operations manager that doesnt know what shes doing and should be in a retirement home"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It's a lot of work. You have to catch on really quick. 3 times a week you have to unload and pack up trucks. Then you have to put all of the things away. You also have to do inventory.
good,I was hired in sales for a seasonal position at Best Buy during college. This position allowed me to become more comfortable with sales and speaking to customers as a professional.
good,"Depends on your manager. First store I worked at my Manager was Amazing. Second store. Horrible. Its all about which store you pick, which area and so on. Stores in areas with more money are usually more ahppy cause theyre hitting their goals and everyones getting bonuses"
good,It was a great place to learn the basics of customer service. Best Buy and the Geek Squad truly put the client first. The company also has a great culture of sales excellence.
good,"You can never be bored working for this company. There is a huge focus on always improving. I pretty much learned all aspects of running a business during my time there. The quality of management will vary by area - some great, some not so much. There is a strong culture built around people with the employees coming first. The downside is the traditional retails hours of nights, weekends and holidays. The upside was competitive pay, benefits and being around the latest and greatest technology products made the work exciting."
good,When I was at Best Buy they had invested in brick & mortar.  They needed to embrace online as well.  The new CEO understands that and seems to be successfully implementing that approach.
good,Good environment if you don't have much experience. Great to learn how to sell and develop your communication skills. Depending on the size and location of store things could get very busy.
good,"It was an interesting job, i liked the work environment and the people i worked with. I learned how to deal with costumer service and important features with computers."
good,"It was pretty cool working here, I just didn't like how they paid us so little when the minimum wage in Cali reached a certain amount. Good first job if you like sales, but not my cup of tea since I'm an engineer."
good,The work environment is just like you would see in a commision based atmosphere but without any of the benefits. The stress I saw while working there was unpleasant and harmful to peoples health. The first time I worked at best buy if you didn't hit the goal individually provided your hours were cut to almost nothing until you out performed your peers to get their hours taken from them. Awful awful work environment.
good,"It was okay, there was a lot of favoritism there. They required employees to meet a ridiculous amount of standards each hour.  It was a lot of work, and you get underpaid!"
good,I was a geek squad tech for 4 years and I did like it but I could never move up to full time. So I ended up leaving. I really did enjoy working there but not a place for a career
good,This is a good job. This employer keeps the employees very busy at the store location that I worked. I believe the people there work well together despite the business for fun things outlside of work as well
good,Worked at the customer service desk handling exchanges and returns. Sometimes helped on the sales floor to. Workplace management was stressful at times with some managers.
good,worked here a long time ago. not sure my view would be applicable. Sales associate was fun very accommodating with school schedule. As a manager later on you were worked crazy amounts of hours. Compensation should have been much higher.
good,"worked you to death.  Paid well. good benefits, very male dominated industry.  Hard to move ahead as a woman unless you were part of the good ole boy gang"
good,Learned customer service and retail skills. Able to work cashier and handle money. Also worked in best buy mobile selling phones. Enjoyed atmosphere and meeting revenue goals
good,To be honest i mainly worked there for the employee discount.  It was able interesting trying to find ways to enjoy working in sales without going crazy
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was one of the top performers of the store in terms of revenue, margin and services as well as a strong character that drank thank the Best Buy koolaid and the admiration of the store employees, yet i was consistently passed by for advancement and was the lowest paid employee at the store."
good,"A typical day at work I am making contacting customers accessorizing their cart and making sales. I learned how to approach different types of customers. The management does their job, no complaints. The Best Buy culture is to be yourself while being the best and were all geeks so it makes work fun. The hardest part of my job is contacting every customer because I'm responsible for 3 departments on different sides of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the team and planning how we are going to achieve the departments goals so we can all get a bonus."
good,"I enjoyed most of the people I worked with except one or two managers. They did not communicate efficiently with associates and they were later fired( which took way to long)"
good,Had a great time working here among my peers. The management should be more organized and vocal. Great discounts and benefits. Overall a good place to work.
good,"This was my first job and I was hired during the holidays and was fairly busy.  I was hired as a loss prevention agent, and the job was fairly easy.  Overall as a part-time job, it was ok."
good,"I only worked at Best Buy part-time while I attended college, but I learned a great deal about sales, retail, and electronics.  Best Buy open the doors to other jobs in my career."
good,Daily wages. We were subcontractors to Best Buy. Sometimes didn’t get off work until 11:00pm. We had to be at work by 7am and left the warehouse by 8am.
good,I like working for best buy. everyone was friendly and wanted to help us succeed. The culture and store atmosphere was outstanding. would definitely recommend them as an employer.
good,"Loved working here but the fact that you were tracked on sales (And they tracked very closely) but didn't make commission didn't make sense. Management/team leads will usually only focus on the hard workers, and the slackers tend to just be there no matter how many times you tell leads they aren't helping. Hours can vary unless youre fulltime,as a part time you maybe get 9-20 hours a week when its not holiday season. Most enjoyable part is your coworkers, they keep you sane when its dead in the store and your manager wants you to sell a lot that shift. Learned good sale techniques but not all will work despite what management says."
good,"It's retail. You know what you are getting. Unless you really feel like pursuing a career here just use it as a stepping stone. It is a job that demands a lot of your time. No weekends, no holidays (in fact you work most holidays), and 10 plus hour days if you are in management."
good,"Best Buy can be a fun place to work .  The employee benefits are great.  It is a great part time job, but not a place to advance. Great place for a first time job."
good,This is a retail location. You are always busy. Best buy has great benefits including the discount. Leadership team is good with meeting your specific schedule of your own.
good,"Am always interacting with customers products sales, concerns, products returns,  products exchanges and recommendations to better technology and support for their products."
good,"There are few who will think Best Buy is a proper career choice. If you can make it past the lower levels, the higher ups do get compensated well. Bottom level employees like me do not get paid well compared to other like positions in other electronic retail environments."
good,good retail store. I enjoyed working here but the hours were not great. I worked every weekend but overall they treated me very well and i learned a lot that served me well.
good,"Boring, slow, not paid fairly. The people who work there are awesome and very fun to be around. The managers are great, but the job is very stressful and pays almost nothing for what you are required to know and do."
good,Good job to have has as a student. Not much room for growth. Managers pick favorites and lots of miscommunication. Great discounts on games and electronics.
good,Good Compensation and benefits. I spent 3 years here and was sought after by another company.  I really have little more to say about a place I worked 16 years ago.
good,"No matter your performance, they reward everyone the exact same. You could lead by every metric and the person hindering the department gets just as much recognition as you. I have learned a lot there and am grateful, but I'm looking for a place I can move up, and a place that lets me get rewarded for my hard work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,assisted customers with daily shopping tips maintained inventory during truck delivery days restocked the sales floor after closing hours maintain a safe and hazard free stockroom
good,not a bad place to work. the location in braintree has questionable management. a shift leader would leave for hours and come back at the end of his shift. the assistant store manager would leave to get his phone fixed
good,"Contact/greet the customers, find out their needs, provides solutions and close! Managers with dictates from above can be a real problem when they are weak managers in the first place. Sell, sell and then sell more.  However a major challenge is dealing with people looking, but buying online... Good Luck!"
good,"Best Buy is a company that on paper should operate in a very straight forward manner and, in many respects, it achieves just that. However, as an employee, there are confusing directives and uncomfortable metrics that are put in place that can make a sales consultant feel more like an up-sell specialist than a knowledgeable  customer resource. From the credit card to higher-profit earning accessories, it seems that the bottom line of a consultant is to risk souring a simple product sale by saturating each client with scripted, awkward up-sells. I personally even witnessed tag teams coordinated via in-ear radios to have multiple employees approach a customer ""candidly"" to hammer in the necessity of adding geek squad protection to an item just to hit their numbers. An odd choice of focus to place on a team of salesmen that do not make commission. "
good,At the time it was a good stepping stone to another career path. Especially if you are going to school. Im sure the enviornment has changed. But a great starting job.
good,i just want to express that working at best buy I have meet some phenomenal people. I believe at the time of my employment the atmosphere was very political and at the time i was employed.
good,"I worked at the front lanes, which meant i was a cashier. The job itself was enjoyable, and the customers made my day, but no room for growth there..."
good,They paid me really well and the job was relatively easy with not much to do aside from assist customers but that was also an issue for me because i like to be kept busy. I learned a significant amount of problem solving skills and customer care. I learned how to operate work systems and computer systems. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the ability to somewhat easily move up in positions on the job if you prove yourself capable. The hardest part of the job was management. There was a variety of leadership issues when it came to them switching often or when it came to the treatment from managment to employee.
good,"it was a seasonal job that turned part-time. it was a decent place to work at. However, the management team didn't communicate well which led to a lot of overseen and misguided conflicts within the structure of the company."
good,"Its retail expect retail hours, pay, and working on Thanksgiving since all the retail company's don't really care about letting employees enjoy Thanksgiving anymore since they all open then instead of Friday for Black Friday."
good,Decent place to work. It was in Edwardsville and I lived in Alton. So riding the transit system presented a problem. Needed more hours and more pay to pay my bills.
good,"The work place culture is fast paced, and is great for people who like to be in retail and customer service. Just like most retail jobs, during the holidays there are more hours and job opportunities."
good,Working at Best Buy was an interesting place to work. I learnt alot about devices I did not know anything about prior to my position. There was always something to do or someone to help.
good,good starter job if you like technology and a customer service job.  Great start to learn sales strategy on a non commission base and learn about product margin
good,"1. expected to work 10-12 hours per day but unable to charge the same to client. This leads to less pay compared to amount of work being done"
good,I worked to open a new location and worked with a team that received corporate training at the home office.  This was a really good place to learn the ropes of customer service.
good,"Enjoyed learning about products, working with staff, and enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. Definitely hard to work with school schedule."
good,"I have learned lots of skills in management that I can move forward with in future jobs. "
good,"Morning shifts - really busy (no chance to breathe until it slows down around 2-3 PM). "
good,very poor work/life balance.  better suited for people that do not have a family.  long hours expected daily for management as well as coming in on days off
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked as an early 20's college graduate and didn't see myself advancing in best buy. I left for better hours and pay at a bank. Now I currently am pursuing a different career altogether. "
good,"Best buy only cares about bottom line proffits , the managers are nice enough but if the bottom line is not being met they are not happy and let you know through your head set"
good,"a typical day at Geek Squad is dealing with irate/stuck up customers and fixing computers, i really didnt learn anything at Geek Squad. Did alot of educating to fellow agents. Management sucked really bad, micro-managing and abusing their authorities. The work place culture was one of the best thing at Best Buy, you get to meet people of all race, work with really cool co-workers and the discounts was also another perk of the culture. The job wasnt hard at all, its just dealing with customers and their foolishness. i really didnt enjoy my job due to the fact of how cut throat this company is."
good,it was a fine cookie cutter job where the staff was ok the location was ok it was an average JOB.  its a perfect job or college kids and single people
good,"Best Buy like many of the big box stores are struggling to stay relevant these days, but they have seemed to be doing one of the best jobs. It is a basic retail job requiring you to know about all of the electronics and they emphasize the sales of services, as this is where they make their money."
good,"Working at the Best Buy Ancaster, was a pretty good place to work at. I was there only for seasonal so it was definitely always busy and made time pass by quickly. I did enjoy working there and the management team and employees were very great and fun to work with."
good,"Great place to work, flexible hours, decent fair pay. Lack of career advancement. Great employee discounts. Overall not a bad job for someone young looking for flexibility"
good,"There were a lot of politics on a high level of management and they all had different mindsets of where they wanted each employee. Lack of communication caused a lot of conflict within the store. Management became poor in my department after a couple months of consistent issues with upper-management. "
good,"You have to maintain a sales per hour, and are forced to ask every cusomer if they would like to apply for the best buy credit card( they like you to have one applicant a day). Pay is decent for a part time job,but would not recommend full time for lack of advancement."
good,"enjoy everything about it and the challenges everyday but the hours didnt fit my lifestyle once my kids were born, compensation could've been better because of the long hours worked"
good,"Working at Geek Squad wasn't bad, although they do push you to try and sell add-on products such as antivirus and additional bloatware for customers' computers.  Some of the staff can be easy to get along with, but the sporadic work schedule and constant push to make you  be an annoying salesman can take its toll."
good,troubleshooting laptop and climbing the high school ladder. like the work just not the the people some where OK and some i didn't. love the training when it was given
good,Cool place to work for to get yourself going.  Its great for people who love customer service and helping out clients to identify the right products for them.
good,"Bon emploi étudiant"
good,learned alot about TV and other electronics  management was very good to work with was willing to work with my school schedule  Best Buy was a very good company to work for while i was in school
good,"I used my time here to help pay for almost all of my college courses with the tuition reimbursement program for full time  employees. The discount is the best benefit to the job at 5% over cost on all items, some of which like HDMI cables that were $149 drop to under $20 for an employee. The downside with the company is full time is considered 32 hours, the healthcare costs went thru the roof for a family plan, and constant restructures makes management a risky choice for job stability."
good,Geek squad is a good start in the IT field but it feels more like a sales job that a computer repair position. You get poor hours if you do not get good numbers and sell well.
good,"A normal day started out with me going and clocking in and going to my register to get ready and start checking for the customers. After it slowed down, I would go through all the aisle and make sure they were faced and fixed neatly"
good,I thought that it was a pretty nice place to work at. If you do not like communicating with customers then this job is not for you. It is really not that bad at all.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy is a great company to work for great benefits exciting place to work in especially if you love electronics. very fast pace environment and must be knowledgeable.
good,I enjoyed working there but the business culture does not suite me. I just need something new I need to support my family and can not do it working there.
good,"ok company provided for family money was great "
good,Excellent work experience came with the job u learned about electronics and how to sell and maintain them I learned about connecting things to make other things work using stuff you wouldn't think to use
good,"It is a great job, the pay could be better. a lot of restructures are happening because the industry is changing to more online, the room for advancement is getting smaller and smaller each year since I've been with the company."
good,It was just a second job for me to supplement but for what it was it was decent for what it was. Didn't have much room for advancement were I was but I didn't have much interest.
good,"Best BUY CANADA										       Calgary, AB"
good,"The business changes almost as fast as the products sold.  During the tenure with the company, we went thru 6 different changes to company structure.  While I always found a role in the company and store, there was always that possibility that things would change and the role would not be there tomorrow."
good,every thing in the company is base on politics and who likes you as a person not necessary your work ethic. HR only cares about bottom line profit and not expert relationship with its assocaites
good,I used to love to come to work and was hopeful to move up on the ladder. New management is rude and inconsistent. It is a horrible feeling to be under appreciated.
good,"Working at Best Buy was challenging as a high-speed retail environment with sales goals that needed to be met on a consistent basis."
good,The experience is amazing. As technology progress you are updated about every new piece of it. You get to sale these items to customers and witness the happiness upon their faces
good,"Everyone (customers, management, coworkers) treats the Merchandising team like the cleanup crew. Wrecking planograms as quickly as we set them, failing to price or change prices of product. Few employees downstock or maintain planogram integrity. Management is content to tell everyone what to do without ever lifting a finger to keep the store tidy. Might be better on a sales position, they bonus more and ha e actual benefits. Merchandising would be fun if it weren't for the unhelpful employees and program bugs."
good,Good Company. Decent Pay. Gained a lot of experience in multiple fields. Held multiple positions. Lots of room for growth. Good benefits for full time employees
good,"In order to be successful in Bestbuy for the specific role I had, you have to be quick and always on your feet. Working diligently while also working clean and ensuring customers needs are fulfilled."
good,"selling tv's an appliances, learned a lot about tec, great managers, culture young people,hardest part working holidays, most enjoyable learning every day"
good,Job could be stressful because of the volume of people at times (either too many for staff or not enough). Overall not a bad place if you need a job temporarily. You will have no life around Christmas time
good,"typical day was average "
good,it is very repetitive deal with customers day in and day out like most jobs. if you are the best on the sales floor then they will never promote you because they do not want to lose the revenue that you generate.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Easy job to do ' the environment it's very calm. The communication with associates and managers can be better ' I love working at Best Buy beacuse it fit with my other working schedule
good,"Typical day ranged from stocking product, customer interaction, cleaning the floor, or working the register. I learned how to effectively deal with customers, price and stock product, and maintain a clean workspace. Management was generally good. Workplace culture was friendly if goal oriented. Hardest part was adjusting to the fast pace initially. Most enjoyable was working closely with a team, adapting and then enjoying the fast paced atmosphere and a few friends I made along the way."
good,"Make sure the layout of the floor that is sent by the corporate office is what is displayed for the customer. If merchandise is low, replenish the product so we don't run out, if we are low put in a order so we can have enough and never be sold out. Check prices, if they have dropped or have increased, make sure the prices are displayed accordingly"
good,"I worked there for four years, went through a couple general managers and had people come and go alot. Good job if you are attending school or want something on the side. Sometimes they put people in charge that make you wonder how they got the job."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy, it afforded me the opportunity to get to know new people and music. I also enjoyed the movies and the employees there as well."
good,"Best buy is a decent company with fair pay. The way the company treats their employees needs to improve, especially the salary employees. As a salary employee they can change your entire start time weather it fits your life or not. You can apply for a am shift and in 6 months they will move you to a pm shift. Your only option is to move to the shift or find another job. As a salary team member you work a lot of overtime with any compensation"
good,in the past Best Buy did focus on the development of there employees . I no longer work for best buy but I woos assume that they still do. culture was an op but
good,"I worked for Best Buy for almost three years. The management was ok, until the new ones arrived and got rid off anyone that didn't share their views. I don't think they had the best views..... The one i worked at went out of business. Anytime i came into town i would stop in.... everyone was on their phone and nobody asked if i needed anything. Very different from when i started."
good,Worked there years ago staff was friendly and lack of hours for new hires they forget about you alot even if you continuously call in to make sure when youre working. Poor supervising
good,"Best Buy was a lot of fun to work at when I first started. Now that we are open almost every holiday, its more about the money than employees. I never would had thought I was going to have to work on a Thanksgiving day and give up spending time with family. That is what life is all about, and to take that away wasn't cool."
good,I like the people that I work with. I think the people that are working in retail are undervalued and under appreciated. Some of these people are the hardest working individuals that I have ever met.
good,Management training was fantastic for new managers. All types of training included to improve your skillset.  Job can be highly stressful dealing with customer and employee issues
good,none I really just want to not do this and it made me do something and I guess I will write until its down with the words do you know foot ball season is here
good,"This job is great for learning foundational skills for computer and technology, customer service, and time management. BestBuy offers many tools to their techs to aide repairs."
good,"Best Buy. What can I say. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  I loved it and I hated it. I looked forward to each day and dreaded each day.  Overall, not the worst, not the Best?"
good,"On a typical day at work you have to have good shoes on because you will be standing for your entire shift, breaks were not long enough. I did not like the store manager.."
good,"Working for this company can be fun and annoying. Having to see a bunch of cool technology is pretty cool. You learn how to sell more and sell better. You talk and intereact with people which can be both very fun and the other way around. You have to keep the place in good shape for better customer experience. Although, the company saves everything you do in statistics and if you do not meet certain requirements, they're going to pressure you to be better or else..."
good,"At Best Buy I was offered the opportunity to accumulate and apply the appropriate knowledge and expertise through continuous learning and self-development, enabling me to provide excellent customer shopping experience."
good,It is a stepping stone for my experience. there is no career forward progression here per say but it is experience.  I have picked up a few simple skills and some was good refresher for me.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"There were a lot of changes when I worked their. Stores were being closed, people were quitting. Team building exercises were not great to come in early for."
good,"It wasnt a bad place to work however the management team seemed to care less about the employees and more about the bottom line, there was no closeness between employees and management"
good,Would come in to help open the computer sales department. Set up displays to make sure they worked properly. Help customers make decisions on what to purchase for their needs.
good,nice place to work. but not enough hours to really make much money. people are nice. product changes often which is fun. good management. decent location
good,A rare retailer that has been able to dynamically react to changing market conditions. The company has been able to optimize selling space through partnerships with vendors. The CEO has been the visionary that the company and its investors have needed. These changes have led to operational complexities due to the complex omni-channel strategies.
good,Working at best buy made me realize that I needed to improve my education status in like in order to advance to positions that I wanted.  It also taught me the necessary customer service skills that I use to this day.
good,"Check in and help customer with diagnosing  computer issues "
good,I loved what I did. It was a good place to work. Some employees were lazy. Overall I liked my job though. Work life balance was great. and most of the employees got along.
good,Best buy does not give commission for sales although they expect you to sell a certain amount per month to get good hours.  Policies became more corporate as the time went on.
good,"pretty nice place to work at, trying to drive as many sales as possible,even without commission employees are put under pressure to sell a lot of store services. Beside that its a friendly environment with good benefits and great employee discounts."
good,"Best buy was a great job and felt like family at times. "
good,Fast paced fun environment. You will never work with a better group of people. Can be stressful especially around the holidays. Hours are tough if you have a family due to working every weekend and most holidays in addition to late hours.
good,it was a good place to work at but the longer you had been there the more they expected which was okay. they let go of all temps which i was one of them so i sadly had to go but i really enjoyed working there while i had the chance
good,"Fun environment, takes alot of work but once you get used to the environment it is a very fun and fast-paced place to work in. There is a lot of room for knowledge and inprovement."
good,"customer interaction"
good,"The attrition rate is very high because of the Inconsistencies with how workers are treated; hard work and Ethics are not appreciated or respected. Management has favorite people with special privilege's. They let work overtime when they really don't have any work, some employees allowed to hang around and do very little while other employees are forced to pick up their slack based solely on their personal relationships with team leads… Management has a disconnect with the day to day operations of the company. For that reason, they constantly make bad decisions, and in recent years the company has lost the most valued employees but the management doesn’t realize that there is a problem."
good,"It was a fun environment to work at but the pay wasn't the greatest. I know they stay away from commission pay, but it would be nice to implement commission instead of bonuses"
good,"Working in Best Buy allowed me to meet great people and learn valuable lessons to take into other jobs. Management isn't always the best nor is it the fairest. You'll often see issues where there is favoritism in play or managers not doing their responsibilities all that well. The salary isn't the great either. Unless you plan on moving up the ladder (which is also difficult because of favoritism and other factors), the salary is not the great."
good,I liked the job a lot of driving around meeting new ppl all the time it was cool just wish it wasn't a temp job for Christmas but if they wanted me to come back I would
good,"It was ok place to work easy job but really little oppurtunity for advancement.  Laid back atmosphere, nice people to work with  ,2 10 min breaks and 20 min lunch break"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work if you love technology and helping customers use it.  Holidays are difficult which is normal and quality of life balance is a struggle for various roles due to the work schedule.
good,"Best Buy is fun and competitive, I highly enjoyed my time working there. The only complaint is that there was no commission based on sales which was hard if you were in the top percent for sales."
good,This position isnt for people who are more social than not. It was fun at times but most often boring. Some of the management had favorites but i did like the opportunity to cross train and pick up hours in other departments
good,This was a great job for me when I was in college. The hours fit around my school schedule and management was helpful with that each semester. Best Buy seems to have gone through some tough times so who knows how long they will be around still.
good,"Fast paced, knowledge of the product that you were selling for the "
good,"Best Buy was a mixed bag. On busy days, you'd make a ton of sales and end up helping a lot of people and your day would fly by. On slow days, it'd be a drag to the point where even with small mundane tasks, it does nothing to help pass time. You learn how to use programs to look up what a product has to offer and how to set it for a delivery to a customer's house. The managers were pretty firm but friendly for the most part. The most difficult thing is trying to help customers out on a product that you're learning about yourself. However the fun part is seeing how excited those customers were when they asked you about something you really liked or was excited about. Talk about priceless"
good,"A mediocre experience overall, mediocre pay, average to below average management, could either be busy or absolutely slow. Overall I'd describe Best Buy as a complacency factory that doesn't pay quite enough to be a full, long term career choice"
good,"This job was a very sweet and salty mixture, the team of employees and management were always nice and helpful, they also did a lot of team building exorcises. Unfortunately the hours (as with most retail) are awful."
good,I can not really write a review about this company because it has been too long since I have worked here. But from the present colleagues that still work there it has changed drastically.
good,"Employee discount is fantastic. Leadership is excellent. Pay is very competitive for retail. Employee retention seems very high. Overall, I would recommend the company to anyone."
good,la empresa es buena simplemente que cuando entras tendan un horario y ya no se puede k cambien
good,Worked at the company for quite a long period before entering management had some amazing leaders and some subpar. The holidays are incredibly stressful as management. You are salaried are scheduled 50 hours minimum and during the holidays this shoots up to 60-70 hours per week so kiss any life outside goodbye.
good,"I haven't worked for Best Buy in 17 years so I have no idea what they have to offer now, but as a customer walking in to buy a laptop for my daughter a couple months back. I will never go back because the sales clerk was rude and laughed at us. When I worked there my clerk would have never done that"
good,"the job is very easy, you learn the products and sell to people. its pretty laid back, only stressful during holidays. Need to be able to talk to people"
good,When its fast its stressful. Management will do anything to keep a customer happy but lacks that same skill in the employee department. When it gets slow it's SLOW. there will be times during a shift where it feels like the space-time continuum stops.
good,"Working here while you're a teenager/early twenty year old is fun. You get to work with a lot of people the same age as you, and people are constantly encouraging each other to do better. However, this being a retail job, the black friday hours are long, but Best Buy does what it can to make the job experience better."
good,This was a temporary job until I had found a healthcare job I enjoyed. Once I found my job at Country Meadows I left this employment. This was a typical retail job. I learned communication with others is the key to any job.
good,"Okay job, discount is great. Pay is blah and hours too. Was getting close to 40 hours a week at first then I started school and it dropped. Now done with school and still no hours are given to me"
good,I worked in several different Best Buy stores over a 12 year span.  It can be a great place to work if everyone works together and leaves their egos at the door.  Company has a good vision and changes with the environment to stay on top.
good,"Best Buy was the job I had before finding jobs in the field I wanted. I was working here because I needed to. The is when I learnt that I wasn't meant for sales."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall working with technology is a very fun environment and you will meet a lot of really interesting, fun and energetic co-workers.  Typical days in sales consist of finding solutions for every customer that comes in and solving complex demands in a short period of time.  A great deal of pressure is put on associates to pitch and sell credit cards to customers."
good,"I worked here over 10 years ago, nothing I have to say now could possibly relevant - again, getting really irritated with this forced rating and 150 ch"
good,"other then peak season, you were never sure what your hours was going to be . wasnt a bad work place though. they treated everyone well and fair. people were decent"
good,"This is my first company in IT career. I learnt a lot in this company. "
good,"The place itself is fun, many times the teams are fun to work with but it gets difficult with many customers. Also, during low sales months management becomes very strict about getting more sales and credit card applications."
good,Rumors of company not doing so well from all levels of management. Staying over hours is expected. The job and company are great however no real job stability.
good,"Company has to always appease the shareholders first and foremost.  the associate is a ""number"" and not part of the company.  each year it seems there are layoffs in stores and corporate.  over 7,000 people in corporate and stores laid off in just the year I was there under the new CEO."
good,"In my opinion Best Buy is a typical retail company that competes with other retail companies. They have excellent training programs that helps you learn the merchandise you sell an proper standard operating procedures.  They have a great insurance program that is eligible for full time employees.  I have worked at 3 different stores and one of the things that I have noticed in all of the locations I have worked is that the Managers have a bad habit of sitting in their office leaving the employees to do as much as they can to run the store while they do whatever it is they do in the office.  It isn't too bad if there is only one manager on duty but the more managers that are working, the lazier they seem to become.  Another grief of the company that I have is that during the so called ''Black Friday"" sale Best Buy employees are now FORCED to work Thanksgiving Day.  I say forced because all Best Buy employees have a Blackout period where you can't take days off from November through the second week in February. I have seen many employees get terminated because of this policy.  This to me is beyond ridiculous."
good,"in a course of a day I would speak to clients that had problems with appliances and schedule a technician to come to homes. I would also , at times decide in what order the technician would be going to which home.  For example, if a technician had more than 1 job in a certain zip code I would schedule those stops right after each other to keep costs down."
good,"distribution is a fast pace job if your willing to work its a good job. good benefits, and time off. good orientated company had a lot of fun working with the team."
good,Was not a fan of how management showed favoritism. Never kept their promise to what they would say. Would run competitions but never gave a reward. Some managers would not show any respect to their employees.
good,"Pay is not the greatest but not the worst, nothing really offered for anyone on part-time employment and they try to only hire part-time employment unless they want people to work in management, this way they do not have to pay benefits"
good,"There were plenty of hours offered, most of the year you could work as many hours as you wanted. They leadership, changed so much, which in turn made the company change so much that it was really hard to keep track of. Other than that they were a good company"
good,"Working at Best Buy was no doubt a great experience, but the major push to sell credit cards and services I may not necessarily believe in can get quite stressful. The opportunities to promote are there and the pay is fair, but I always felt that no matter how well I may have been doing, there was always something that I was doing wrong."
good,"The job was fun. Management was poor, I worked here while attending school in my teens and it was a great experience. Not many benefits but is a great place if you are a teenager"
good,A manager can either drive your company or ruin it. I enjoyed helping out customers and i loved my co workers. I learned so much about different products in the store. We were really the latest and greatest.
good,Have not worked at Best Buy for over 13 years. I left because I was hired on at a different job. The store manager didn't like the fact I was National Guard and was being taken for drill 1 weekend a month. He threatened to manage my performance and hold me directly responsible for my departments sales numbers if I was there or not due to my military obligation
good,"I did all kind tasks at Best Buy customer service clean and stock,Pricing , change of technology .lean to interact. I was trained to approach. Customers. In a professional way to make that sale."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"it was ok working there"
good,Overall good experience. Cared alot about stats and sales more than anything. Wanted to you push customers into selling more than anything else in the store
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, diversidad de horarios y de trabajo."
good,I worked at several different locations and mgmt at each one was quite different.  the location i enjoyed best was Costa Mesa. Mgmt was thankful and the customers friendly.
good,took calls from customer who were complaining about best buy/geek squad.  i learned the quickest way to learn about a company is to work in customer relations.  management was there when needed.  the hardest part of the job was hearing best buy employees disrespect the customer when they called to tell me about an issue they were having in the store.  working from home.
good,"I learn a lot in  the A/V world. It's so fun to design a home theater with automation  As a designer and a sales person, i would meet with my clients at their houses before i design a system that fit their need."
good,Good experience for entry level IT Pros. Simple by the book instructions to help guide customers to troubleshoot from their homes while gaining experience in the field.
good,Culture was good. People were ok. Benefits were terrible. Pay was terrible.  There was nothing enjoyable about working here. A lot of favoritism from upper management.
good,You will need to have a great deal of patience if you have a high level of tech experience. You will meet many great people and almost all of the people I worked with cared about helping people.
good,Management often cared more about numbers than there own employees. Good place to learn customer service at a young age. The customer always comes first.
good,"Best Buy was a friendly environment, although pay and benefits were not good in my opinion. I was successful in my position but the pay was minimal. I worked here during college."
good,I love the people at this company but it is not run with efficiency. A lot extra work is needed to pick up the slack from a lot of employees. I learned a lot here that is valuable and will help me in my future.
good,"Great job for beginners but part time is 30 hours but if your not performing well or the manager doesn't like you then your hours get cut back, I have seen 10 hours given to weak performers while top performers get 32+ hours. Also trying to move from different departments is difficult especially if that department is practicing favoritism over professionalism."
good,"While the people and experiences are nice, the overall outlook as a career is poor. There is no real way to advance without having to stay at a low paying job for years before having a chance at one. There just doesn't feel like a way to be an important team member when there is no room to grow."
good,"•	Provided solutions that ensured customers’ end-to-end needs were met by means of leveraging all channels including hardware, accessories, connections, content and services. "
good,"Worked for Best buy for only a few months over the holidays. Seemed fair, knowledgeable, and truly cared about the employees and customers.  Would work for them again in the future."
good,"This company is very sales driven, which can be stressful during off seasons. They make you compete for full time positions based off of who can sell the best."
good,"I enjoyed the job, the one's I worked with, not the customers, not the hours that got dropped to almost nothing, yet great environment and coworkers at this place."
good,Great place to work if you need to create some type of income.  Job was easy  with easy metrics to obtain. reliable brand and benefits. Growth opportunity unknown.
good,"Review numbers from the day before as well as review numbers for the day.  Coach associates who were not reaching goals for the store.  Make sure all clients were being help promptly as well as understanding their issues and resolving them.  Meeting with managers in the store to go over goals for the month. Make sure department was clean and up to company standards."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Its been a very long time since i work at Best buy great starter company. To get hands on training and learn management skills and customer service...
good,Accommodating to young individuals who attend school.  Basic training and company knowledge provided by trainers.  Hands on job; learn as you go type atmosphere.
good,I was young and got a great employee discount. What was also great was that most of us were around the same age. I banged a few of the chicks that worked there. It was a great place to get a blow job.
good,"I worked in the warehouse, and I really enjoyed the experience. My coworkers in the warehouse were great people. The management was really great, and understanding of my medical needs."
good,"It's Retail! Very detailed SOPs that are hallmarks of most large, corporate businesses. Advancement is mainly predicated on time served. Pay is on the lower side compared to amount of time required to complete high quality work. But again, retail."
good,Its a good job for tech heads get to play with all the new tech first. Hours are fair and helps keeping a balances life and the discount is the best by far.
good,Fun place to work at if you enjoy technology. Pay is low but benefits are pretty decent if you get on as full time. The discount is the standout feature.
good,"Working at Best Buy was a fun experience where I was able learn a lot about the elements of sales from some of the best sales leaders in the industry.  Great place to work part-time, since full-time hours are demanding and pay may not be there to balance out the time away from family.  "
good,"Nothing to report out of the ordinary. It's your typical , college kid job filled with confused young adults thinking they are going to change the world by selling flatpanel TV warranties and Monster cables. "
good,"A typical day at work -pick the product, load and unload trucks. "
good,the company focuses mainly on hiring part time associates and full time positions are lead positions and require dedication to train and coach other employees
good,Lots of departments to work in and always knew products to learn and become familiar with no matter which department you work in. Typical retail hours which includes weekends. No commission but still expected to sell products and services.
good,"It's a great job while you're in college, but however its not really the place you want to be long term in a career aspect. Management plays favorites at any store you go to, so it makes hard to move up the ladder. The full timers look down upon the part timers."
good,"I worked as a cashier and in the appliance area. The fact that I was bilingual helped me attain this job. It was a heavily male employed store. Overall, I gained great customer service experience."
good,It is a good entry level job to get your foot in the door for some IT related work but im not sure how far it will go on your resume for another IT job of higher skill
good,"If you don't plan to move up, don't stick around too long. Can get bogged down in retail politics very easily. If you do however plan to move up you have to spend time on the sales floor, non exceptions."
good,"It was a nice place to work and grow skills, but it is heavily geared toward constantly upselling even when it's unneeded. Friendly staff and days went by very fast. Efficient on managing breaks when needed."
good,Just buy into their motto sell their useless stuff meet the goals by making customers buy stuff they don't need and you'll excel well. Because no one cares what you do unless you sell things and no one returns it.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Friendly place to work.  Flexible with hours and very family oriented.  Work was always a challenge.  Management was hands on and available for any questions or training issues.  The group I was in was very much supportive and a team.
good,Best Buy was an easy job but it was an endless job.  There was constantly something to do which was nice because it helped the time go by fast.  I would recommend this job to anyone who needs a part time job.
good,best buy is a great place to work in terms of gaining proper sales experience. Management is nice and helpful. You also meet a lot of people which is great for networking
good,"Good way to get started with electronics, you learn a lot and with good people as well. They teach you all the skills you need to know and then some. Work environment is great with lots of positive attitude."
good,"Best buy was a fun place to work but the pay in mediocre for the work they ask you to do. They are also way behind and insist you track you work on pen and paper,"
good,the only downside to the company is that the say there is room for advancement but when it come down to it. they expect you to work harder and tell you this is what you have to do to get to the next level. when you reach that goal they do not have a position for you or they say the company is moving in a different direction and these are the new goals.
good,"Overall, this was a nice place to work. I enjoyed my location and also the extensive training that was provided to all team members. It is a knowledgable place."
good,"As a one of the veteran employee having worked here for 15+ years, I worked in different areas of the building and can say have tremendous knowledge and experience of the systems, WMS.  A typical day at work starts with gathering information about the shuttle returns and assigning work to employees accordingly."
good,I did not enjoy working for best buy all that much. I learned a lot from the people around me but didn't enjoy the company I was working for or the way they trained the employees.
good,Environment was a productive one as I was able to understand and grow in my carrier. There was a lot of enjoyable work to do and the colleagues were also a good support.
good,"Best Buy is a corporate run company and it shows, most management are nice but some are not employee centric. They have great benifits for full time employees."
good,"it was a bad workplace to work at, the managers were not very friendly and the place was not being managed very well. The managers only cared about their positions and did not care about employees at all!"
good,Was a good job for xmas but it was only temp. As soon as xmas was over then they let us all go but they did treat us all really good for being temps. it was a good job and i did enjoy being there.
good,There was too many problems going on in that store with a lot of personal drama which made it a very uncomfortable work place. Great company but not good workplace.
good,"This was not a great job but at least it was a paycheck. There was a lot of standing in one spot for hours. Poor training, after several months I only had limited knowledge of how to operate the security camera system. Had to deal with overly sensitive customers who got offended just by asking to check their receipt as they were leaving."
good,"The work was usually easy, but since I was seasonal the management didn't much care for me. A day at work was slow paced most of the time. The best part was the employees."
good,This is a great job if you are in high school. Benefits aren't that great and neither is the pay. I would not try to make a career there. But like I said great if you are young
good,most days was spent unloading trucks or picking orders for customers. I learned how to operator fork lift and inventory. Good atmosphere to be in. Management was good. There was always meetings to let us know we was doing good.
good,"Best Buy is determined to stay afloat and relevent in a quickly changing retail reality. They have a certain respect for workers, but shed specific jobs quickly and readily. "
good,"During my time with the company I was able to work with many great people and sell a lot of amazing products to put smiles on the faces of so many."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Overall the store can be productive but they often get lazy every once in a while depending on time of day. Management is very considerate of outside lives and is willing to work with you n certain circumstances but fall short on actual duties in the workplace to often then not. Most enjoyable part of the job is the many different type of customers that come in the store and hearing their stories trying to figure out the best solution for the problem. What I've learned from this job is to take care of yourself mostly however make sure your coworkers are taken care of in their proficiency and knowledge to ensure their is a balance in your department. You should never fill like someone is doing most of the job than others.
good,Throughout the day I just basically helped customer pick out Tvs and game systems and give the best customer service possible. then I would cover peoples break.
good,"I have worked for this company in various roles for the last few years. I have found it to be a fairly enjoyable experience. I have however, found the 'gap' coaching to be counterproductive, especially with little emphasis on recognition and behaviors, rather than metrics. I found it very difficult to provide for my wife and two children on this income alone."
good,Cared more about the company than my development. I was part time and in college and along with being short staffed the chain was not managed the best.
good,High paced and fun depending on how much you know and how much you care in informing or helping people. I found this being the better part of the day. Now when it came to selling I usually only sold the products they needed. Never sold them anything more which didn't go well with my superiors but they never really game me any lip for customers would always leave a good word either to them personally or online. There was room for growth but it came with doing things I didn't believe in.
good,"too much politics; and petty management that play favorites, but do not act as management should with direct reports.  "
good,Cool place to work. Liked the work and liked the management. Learned a lot and taught a lot. Really missed working at BestBuy. Assignments had enough time and less pressure.
good,"Typical work day would be kind of slow. Its a good job, just to slow paced for me. I like to stay busy constantly.  The company has great benefits for their employees."
good,"The discount was great and my fellow employees were good to work with. They put together a good team of people. However, I was alwasy pushing to get more hours to no avail."
good,"Responsible for promoting GSP, making sales quotas, no extra pay for making sales, rude store manager, pitching credit cards nobody wants. The co-workers are nice."
good,Working at Best Buy is laid back although you will find some inefficiency that are company wide and can only be fixed at the corporate level. Overall a great place for a student to work while in school. Management is reasonable.
good,"Not really much to say about Best Buy.  If you've ever worked retail, this isn't much different.  No set schedule, required to work every black Friday, you work your shift and go home.  You have to voice your intentions, if they are to move up.  You won't always be heard.  Benefits are unremarkable, and management is typical."
good,"I did not work here long enough to provide a lengthy review but, overall, the store that I worked in, Dadeland Station, received a lot of traffic and sold a lot of inventory on a daily basis. They were very fast paced and the management did a great job of providing enough breaks, support, and education about their products to their staff. All in all, if you enjoy working in retail stores, I'd have to say this company treats their employees the best out of the rest of those retail places. Very good leadership and some great trainers who will help you be extremely knowledgeable on every product the store carries."
good,"Working at Geek Squad City seems to be the same as typical warehouse work, even on the repair lines. Units that need repair come and go, and become as completely indefinite as boxes are in shipping and receiving."
good,"Work hard and you'll be treated well. There's always something new to learn about and the discount is pretty great. It's the most family like environment I've ever felt in a work place. There is favorotism however, which makes it difficult to move up."
good,Its a good place to learn and this is the limit I am trying to make the limit is the limit of the review I dont think it is fair to force someone to write a review
good,"Started out at the bottom as a pt cashier at 17 and worked my way to second in command of the a store as an exempt employee. Seen it all the good the bad and the weird. Lets face it its still retail. Best part of the job is the fellow employees, the worst part of the job is the fellow employees. The leadership team makes or breaks the experience and overall store. Customers are the bright side being able to help people genuinely."
good,El ambiente esta bien aunque hay favoritismos y poco crecimiento laboral la paga es muy baja ya que te dan pocas horas te hace crecer como persona y vendedor aunque te exigen vender y pues aveces no hay nada de gente.
good,the management was terrible and does not care about the family or health of its employees. I was in the hospital and got fired because I couldn't come into work.
good,"Was great for a long time management came and went tho and a lot of store policies change so alot of changing as well as product change, not alot of room for advancement,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The job was very boring and hard on the back. You were confined to a small space and could not leave unless someone came to relieve you. Sometimes this took 30 minutes or longer.
good,"Management can be better, not the greatest. Workload can be too much for one individual but i manage to get the job done. work life balance is great. workplace culture is good."
good,"It's a typical retail job. The discount is probably the best part. Not any more or less fair than most retail jobs. I wouldn't try to make a career out of it, but it's ok for part-time or seasonal help, or for college students."
good,"A typical day of work at Geek Squad for me was coming in and completing morning paper work and then work through the computers we had in the back which were in need of repairs. Also completed shipping and other carious tasks that pertained to my job"
good,was fun. but wanted a career in the medical field so that what I got. I like Best Buy and would work there again. I love electronics and still shop there
good,Best Buy was a fun place to work especially if you're into electronics. but again I wanted to get into the medical field so that is what I did. way happier now
good,It's s good place to work at not bad pay or hours and the work isn't bad to do overall not bad place to work for had a good time there and good environment to
good,The sales associate position is a fast paced position. You have to greet every customer and tend to their specific needs. Some days are slower than others.
good,"A very good company, however depending who your leadership is can make for a very difficult job. Results are the number 1 priority and how you achieve those can determine your success."
good,"We all know that they will eventually be replaced by amazon its just a matter of time. They are grasping at straws to stay alive, this manifests in the form of bananas company initiatives and buzz words which employees are made to recite to customers lest they incur the wrath of the managers. average pay, not all that taxing of work. This is a survival job."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you are a college student or a parent due to the flexible scheduling and working with you on your hours. It's easy to talk to management about any questions or concerns you may have. Some days, specially around the holidays, you will be working very hard and much longer hours. Moving up is very difficult. But overall it is a fairly well company to work for."
good,Typical day included doing security rounds and checking surveillance. The culture was very much high schoolish. A lot of cliques and not much dedication to work.
good,"I've only worked at two stores in a total of about three years with the company.  Honestly from my own experience, there's still some work to be done. But it is great for those who are really in to electronics and things."
good,It is not a bad place to work. Employees could be treated better but they do their best for workers' safety. I do believe they could do more in terms of benefit.
good,"Bestbuy est une place avec une bonne ambiance et un environnement de travail agréable qui m'a permis d'apprendre beaucoup sur le service à la clientèle, la vente, l'informatique et mobile. Je suis reconnaissant envers Bestbuy et je n'ai que des bones choses à dire.  Si il y a une chose qui me fait voir ailleurs est le salaire."
good,"The retail consumer industry has changed over the years, companies responsibility to the employees has fallen short to the obligation to appease shareholders."
good,"I enjoyed working with individuals who had an interest in technology and a passion for helping people find the right fit in a computer or tablet, however management was often stubborn and pushed for rule changes that hurt productivity and morale."
good,I do not want to answer this question about every single company I have worked for.  You should not force people to answer this question for every employer.
good,"Pros"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The company worked will with the fact that I was pursuing an education with the intent on moving out of that industry after graduating. Great perks and an awesome team of people.
good,I enjoyed Geek squad even though getting promoted was nearly impossible. The culture there is amazing with the wide variety of people that work there. There are yearly raises based on your performance.
good,not a bad company to work for.  decent 401k plan packages.  great discounts.  lots of work but fun environment.  part time does not receive health benefits.
good,"It was very fun considering that I am 18 and love electronics, but for someone looking for consistent work or full time work it is not the best. Overall its fun for part time but not very reliable."
good,"The employees were all cool for the most part, the managers are fair, and the job itself wasn't too difficult. At times the store got busy, especially during the holidays and around tax time, but once I got the hang of the job things became a lot easier. Typically, I was responsible for receiving shipments into the store and preparing customer orders to be sent to their home or picked up from the store. I worked in the warehouse so my other responsibilities included keeping the warehouse clean and making sure all the trash throughout the store was thrown away. I also helped customers carry large items to their cars."
good,"pretty good company nice people and great benefits. hiring process is a little difficult but if you jus keep calling for the hr manager, youll eventually get a response."
good,"I was let go sooner than expected and was told they would call me back in a week or so.  When I didn't hear from them, I called and was told that the agency rep. did not work there anymore and they didn't need help."
good,It is a really easy college job but managers are not the best. They sometimes hire people who are not the best when it comes to learning the products and do not learn how to interact with customers well.
good,"Like the electronics they sell, Best Buy is very straightforward and interconnected. They train their employees decently enough for their protection, and the customer's best interest."
good,Great place to work and move up to a supervisor level. Learn all aspects of retail from the back room to the front room. Opportunity to move with in is a great prospect.
good,"Great Staff, however when it comes to black Friday - it is not fun. A great ""first job"" experience. Everyone is nice and help you fit in. If you are not certain of something you can have your buddies to help out"
good,Best Buy was a good job. Fairly ranged age of co-workers and decent working enviorment. I feel like its is a dead end job however. I would work this job part-time.
good,Very busy with a lot of tasks to be done and no time.  District always coming to stores with different visions per different district position. Company does not care about employees.
good,Management does a good job of keeping customer flow in check but regularly does not schedule enough people for shifts causing customer dissatisfaction.
good,Extremely fun environment and customer base. Some of the managers are very rude. The product is fun to sell and the other employees are very friendly. Good pay and benefits.
good,I enjoyed working at Best Buy the customer base was varying and interested. I worked in Home Theater and gained a lot of knowledge. Management was good and the organization was pretty fair.
good,"Best buy wasgreat to for, Pay could have been more but the people and friends you meet working there make it worth it. Some of the Mangment are not experienced enough to be in the positions they are in."
good,I worked at a mobile store that was managed by a guy who was also being forced to managed 3 other stores at the time. The store closed only two years after opening..
good,"A typical day of work on the sales floor is that we are expected to sell $800 per hour; approaching to customers within 10-15 seconds when they arrive in our department making sure they find what they're looking for. We are also tracked on the performance how many credit card applications we have customers applied with each employee. The enjoyable part is working with some great people and it's easy to get along with coworkers. Overall, I learned new things working in the computers department about the new technology we get into the store and it's good to educate customers on the laptops we sell in the store as well."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Can't imagine working full time there but as a part time job not bad, there isn't much to advance to, job can bring some challenges but not  too difficult, people there are easy to get along with, overall it was an alright experience."
good,"Best Buy looks out for their employees, and the people are great. At times I felt like they didn't compensate me enough for my skill set, but that really only happened when we where extremely busy."
good,"It has been a good long while since I was employed but I do remember this was the first job I had out of the service. It was pretty much cashiering and it was a difficult adjustment from being a Marine. I was written up for being at the hospital when my son was born and not given opportunity to advance, it may have been coincidence but it seemed reserved for the females to advance or take time from work for their children. I was given a pretty flexible schedule for school and the environment was nice."
good,"Though it looks like a fun company to be apart of, it really isn't. If you are looking to be apart of a career-oriented job, this company isn't the one you are looking for. I would recommend it as a part-time job or another job on the side, but not for full-time work. The pay is not something you can support a family on. The management in stores are lackluster at best. It sucks when the employees, especially on their operations side, are breaking their backs and get little in return in terms of awards and accolades and isn't treated fairly by management. The traveling part does suck because you are away from your loved ones and you work overnight which itself is difficult alone."
good,"They provide you with little pay, but people who are fans of technology can go on to have great careers with the company and make a decent living."
good,Youll find yourself enjoying the environment and people around you. The scheduling is shaky and random at times. Management is more focused on hitting statistics or numbers instead of helping employees find ways to improve the way hey do their jobs. Ideal if you're looking for some extra money without getting to involved in the corporate chain.
good,"Management has something to be desired, not alot of flexibility when it comes to time off and going to school. Hours arnt always very consistent, so you don't always know what your going to get."
good,"Inventory was by far the worst job I've ever had. I've had a 24/7 on call job that paid less than inventory, and I liked it more. I often worked 8 hours 7 days a week, usually with as little as 6 hours in between shifts. It was seasonal, and I expected this, but what surprised me was that the full time people were doing the same thing. No one did their job right (I don't just mean they didn't do it by the book, I mean what they did was completely wrong.) and working so many hours everyday, it was almost always me who was there when a manager got angry."
good,My overall experience at Best Buy has been educational and beneficial. I've learned about business acumen and working with different types of customers. Management  always took an interest in my goals and development inside and outside of the company. Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. Hard but not impossible. Most enjoyable part was working alongside my co workers and leadership team.
good,"best buy is a decent place to work. i have been happy there for about a year, the job is a great gate way for me to be able to move on to bigger and better things."
good,I enjoy working for best buy I would just like more than 8 hrs. a week.  The staff is fun to work with and be around.  I enjoy working with customers and in receiving.
good,Working at Best Buy is great if you love tech but there is very little room for advancement unless a management spot opens up ( which very rarely does).
good,The people you work with are going to make/break your experience working here. Customers are commonly high tempered so be prepared. The everyday work is very repetitive and can even put you to sleep.
good,"Agréable environnement de travail"
good,"motivating, coaching and training employees, meeting sales goals, analyzing and developing strategies regarding business metrics. Enjoyed talking to customers to provide a great purchasing experience. Difficult to keep up to date with all the latest and greatest technology, required weekly research. Learned valuable information and strategies to grow a business."
good,After the  holiday  season you  will only work  a little  bit of  hours even if you are full time. The company is also very strike with the employees.
good,"The place was a simple place to work, not the hardest.  Pay was a little low.  The company environment relies solely on managers, if they arent enjoying it you wont either."
good,"Enjoyable if you love technology and being around it constantly. Stressful at times, especially around the holidays but isn't unbearable. I would recommend it for some people"
good,I had so much fun with all of the Best Buy employ and the management of the Best Buy is really good and all of the manger are very nice and I learn from them.
good,"Sales"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy consists of talking to lots of customers and finding out what device best suites their needs. You are expected to attach geek squad to most purchases. I learned that the more time you spend listening to customers instead of you doing the talking, the more sales you will most likely make. Management was decent but it definitely felt sometimes like their could be cliques within the store and people in those cliques maybe got a bit more special treatment. Co-workers were great, a really nice, fun group of people. The hardest part of the job was definitely trying to attach all the extra accessories and warranty coverage. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and talking to customers."
good,"When hiring they'll promise a lot of money, but not the case after working there. A lot of empty promise. Cant just dangle the carrot like that. Will have a lot of people leaving the company."
good,Fun and upbeat work environment. great place to work if your a fan of all the new tech coming out. Very flexible hours with great management to help you succeed
good,"I loved working on customers vehicles. However, I had to do 3 jobs in one. Answering phones, being a cashier, and an Auto Technician were not 3 things I could do at the same time. This happened every day I worked there and the company rules forced employees to be afraid of losing their jobs. Would not recommend."
good,"management was awful, many got fired for soliciting their employees,  work gets easily done when everyone knows what they're doing,"
good,"I was thrown out into a pack of wolves per say, they didn't really train me so I learned as I went. It gave me a bit of freedom, but freedom isn't always the best."
good,improvement to my customer skills being in different settings in and outside the home and gain new skills along the way with installing appliances from waterlines to gas connecters with ranges and etc..
good,"Best Buy has been a great work experience for me. Having bounced around to a few different positions within the company, there has always been a consistency of good leadership. The most enjoyable part about this job is the extremely flexible hours. The hardest part about this job are the many flaws in the company's various ""systems"" that we are expected to use on daily basis and sometimes, unrealistic goals set by corporate."
good,"Flexible hours, great if you're looking for part-time work. Easy work life balance, fun and diverse working environment. Perfect for college students."
good,Not really a memorable place to work. I was very young and it was a retail job for the time. I remember Saturday morning meeting when I wasn't scheduled... was not fun.
good,I worked for this company over seven year. I had started as a part time associate and worked my way to a manager. The pay was great an so was the bonus. Working in this field I had alot of experience and was well qualified for a job promotion untl one day they hired someone in the field without experience but had a degree. I decided to go back to college and further my education until my time comes.
good,Working at Geek Squad during the 2014 holiday season was the peak of my retail career. Working more than 40 hours per week was a catalyst for the development of my customer service skills.
good,"good pay, nice coworkers "
good,"Best buy's culture is what makes the company great.  Awesome training programs.  They really go all out, unique company in this aspect.  My one complaint would be the starting pay."
good,You had to deal with customers that came in about prices on items that other associates in different departments told them that wasn't true and overall it was a lack of communication
good,It can be a very political environment. If you don't get in with management you will be stuck at the same level with no chance to advance. The job is not commission based but it is very much sales driven depending on the position and can be very stressful.
good,The work days was fast Paced. I learned about process times and shipment dates. The co workers were good individuals. There was no hard parts and the days was enjoyable.
good,"operated stand up reach truck forklift loading and unloading product off truck trailers. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This is a pretty good job.. I would recommend it to those who like sales, but do not need much $$.. That is one of the reasons I left, but I met some nice people.."
good,Worked in home theater sales as a part time job while in college. Was a decent job but as with any retail job holiday hours were unforgiving. Most co workers were good to work with
good,"It was pleasant working at Best Buy however the management of personal time and work are not an even ratio--they work you hard. "
good,"Managed sales team of 50 plus agents for Training Quality and overall customer experience."
good,"Would wrok here again for the fact that there are alot of electronics, good customer service, and sometimes freindly staff to nerd out with."
good,Great place to work. Pay may not be reasonable at times but there's plenty of opportunity for growth. The managers were all very helpful and skillful.
good,A relaxed workplace with great people. Hours were flexible and the supervisors were are helpful. Would definitely recommend a friend to work here.
good,Not a bad place to work. Not a lot of opportunity unless you want to relocate. Lots of employees come and go here it seemed.
good,"Management was decent. Initially, there was a great general manager, James, and when he left the store it started to go downhill."
good,Working at Futureshop (now BestBuy) was a very rewarding experience i learned a lot about sales and how to properly talk to customers. The management was strict but within reason and the co-workers were very relaxed and eager to teach the newer workers the ropes.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Samsung, the people I worked with were great and so was the pay, but management was not so great. Often they expected more than what could be done in such little amount of time."
good,I had fun with the tech in the store and when it was slow i would demo product and try to learn all their features. Not a bad way to get paid in my opinion.
good,"A typical work day can get a little stressful when your are trying to accomplish several tasks and take care of clients and employees."
good,"I made a lot of chill friends working at Best Buy. Employee discount, I was able to get a lot of cool gadgets while I was there. Standard customer service job."
good,"over all it is a good place to work, i took it for what it was. I knew i did not want to be in a retail store but was not sure what i wanted at that point. "
good,"Company and management are ok. Literally just ok, like slightly above average. Coworkers make it above average. Just don't expect great pay/benefits/anything."
good,"decent company if your looking for something to get by. Fun atmosphere, great co workers. Every employees tried to help fellow employees during peak hours."
good,Normal retail position with chance for advancement if you push hard enough. The management is helpful if a little hung up in bureaucracy. Some times sales tactics are put second to paperwork.
good,Loved the people I worked with! The worst part about my job was the early 6am meetings and extended late holiday hours. Best part of all the employee discount.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to learn the basics of sales and salesmanship, compensation is not that competitive and there is no extra compensation (other than Mobile); your experience will depend largely on the store management"
good,Working as a team  makes the dream. Helping every customer that walks through the door. No customer turned down for help. All customers leaving with a smile.
good,"No room for growth."
good,"Very easy job, just too far to drive .I picked orders for stores across the states & put them in containers & sent to shipping."
good,Working here was fun and I had great co-workers that made me excited to be there. Most of the time it was pretty easy going but sometimes would get a little stressful due to meeting target sales when things were slow.
good,"Very fast paced environment.  Working hours and shifts are not very regular and steady.  Training in customer service is excellent, and emphasis is placed on product knowledge when serving customers."
good,"I've been working with Best Buy as a merchandiser for about 4 months now, and I have to say that I do enjoy some of the work that is offered to us. The other part of the work is less than satisfactory."
good,this job was typically you would go in and deal with customers all day. I like being part of a team but I wanted to take my talents elsewhere otherwise a pretty cool company. nothing against them
good,It was an OK work in environment although management was a little dis-functional all the workers where a joy to be around
good,Working for BestBuy has its perks. Great discounts as an employee and good benefits if full time.I enjoyed the staff and co-workers. Holiday parties were fun
good,"Starting work is fast paced. you have to get used to making sales within the first few days on the job. The job did not offer much support to new employees, and did not show much regard to the customers."
good,"Average job with really nice employee perks. People are cool, easy going and friendly."
good,Pay does not amount to the work put in. Not given the proper acknowledgment for the work that one has done successfully. It is nearly impossible to move up in company.
good,"At Best Buy, they try to act like you're in the absolute best place to work, like your getting so much from it, when really you're getting $10/hr with no commission and its hard work. It was a fun environment though, My managers were awesome and fun to talk to. I enjoyed my co workers a lot."
good,it ok the people on the  job make it an undesireable place to work and advancement is impossible unless you get into the click
good,one thing i like was i got to meet new people everyday at work. people from around the world. benefits didn't star till you reach the year mark instead of the three month span
good,"Best Buy overall wasn't too difficult of a job if you have a decent grasp of modern technology.  Overall training can be sparse for new employees, which can cause a gap of consistency among workers.  Management was always good with giving feedback to employees and was good with explain sales goals and metrics.  Best Buy may be tough as a career for some, but can be a great overall starter, or bridge job for many."
good,"I would run million dollar departments and a very store to make sure every single customer was being taken care of.  Making sure all my employees are caught up on all trainings, are utilizing all their time properly."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Benefits and Time off. Best Buy has values and corrective action plans. Lots of opportunity to advance. Spent a lot of time growing with this company. I have gained tons of customer experience.
good,"unloading a 30 foot trailer and replenishing the store with items. I have learned that team work make the dream work. Management always encourage us to keep getting better. Co workers made my work day fun by cracking jokes everyday. Hardest part of the job was getting my hrs cut every week, Most enjoyable part of my job was getting discounts of items."
good,This is a pleasant place to work at. Nice environment and fair staff and management. I would recommend this company. I would recommend this company.
good,Helped customers with various questions about electronics. Performed returns/exchanges and diagnostics on all electronics. Worked well with co-workers and all of management.
good,"This place is okay to work, the worst thing is management. They really suck, and don't know how to work with the employees"
good,"Not a bad place to work to help get the bills paid. Good opportunities for advancement through the structure. Low pay for the first few years. Great place to meet people and improve on your interaction skills if necessary. Very inconvenient scheduling at the location I worked, may be different in other stores."
good,"Sometimes a lot of work, and not worth the pay. Holiday season is a nightmare. Easy job to do. "
good,"Typical day is helping customers with finding products in the store, ordering them online or having them picked up in the store. I also organize and replenish products. "
good,"My experiences have helped my skills in developing customer relations, management, plan development skills in fast paced work environments. I was able to adapt to a new field where and taught me that not only can I adapt to changes, but that I am capable of learning in a fast paced environment."
good,"Coworkers are definitely the best thing about Best Buy, and management has been great with the exception of a few unnamed individuals. Overall, my social skills have improved greatly, and the only really challenging thing about it is learning the selling points for the vast selection of items."
good,"A typical day at work included greeting customers, checking customers qualifications, and recognizing their needs. I learned how to multitask and better communication skills. Hardest part would be meeting daily goals."
good,best buy is an amazing place to work at but the wrong management is often hired as well as the wrong employees. The employees who deserve praise don't receive it and the employees who deserve criticism don't get it
good,management was sort of all over the place. wasn't quite organized. Schedules where never done on time. Training could of been more insensitive
good,"It Was A Decent Place To Work I Accumulated Great Skills But It Was Short Lived I Took What I Learned And Apply It To Any Position That I Come Across Past,Present And Future"
good,Answered phones and assisted customers with problems. directed them to the correct department. Sent customers to management when requested. Sales associate with all the departments.
good,"Very productive and I always walked around my job. Sometimes tiring, but I was able to maintain a healthy lifestyle in this job. It was a good job to have while in school ."
good,helping people with their computer related issues. many different challenges with multiple solutions. you get what you pay for and best buy will deliver.
good,"Working for geek squad is easy if you have some technical skills."
good,"Worked here during the christmas break, learned a lot about customer service and a great place for your first job. Would definitely work again"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Every morning they have an icebreaker that even if you are having a bad day, it usually turns into a better day.  They are fun to work with and always there to help you go above and beyond.  They coach you to be better and do better.  Constructive criticism and always positive."
good,"The job was kind of fun at first but some of the managers were draining and in the end, it isn't really worth the discount. But I did make friends there and it helped me when I needed it."
good,Quick pace atmosphere with new challenges every day. Full of opportunities with a lot situations to be creative and find ways to make customers happy.
good,"assist customers"
good,fast paced sales job with customer facing and handling issues. great perks with discounts and vendor relations. retail hours on holidays and weekends
good,very good at training in sales techniques and personal development. Co-workers are very helpful and even eager. Typical day started and ended with sales lots of sales.
good,They'll keep you busy day in and day out. There's many levels of bureaucracy and that can be a gift and a curse.
good,one thing that bestbuy did good was teach you a lot of god skills. Communication skills and other work related skills. but for me the company made to many changes to quickly and couldn't ever decide what direction they actually wanted to go
good,This job is an excellent job for someone who is looking for full time work with consistent working hours.  It is good opportunity to learn the computer and electronics business.
good,"Hard to keep your revenue goal to where management sets it as... specifically if you dont know any other department... specifically in my department (Networking, health/fitness, portable audio)"
good,"Working at Best Buy Canada was a great experience to view the underside of the customer service belly. You learn the greats and the lows of the customer service world. But that's retail for you. Management is good, however I felt as if they carried to close to the corporate end and didn't carry original character to run the store. Pay is ok as an entry level position, and internal growth into the corporate end is common. However, you must last through the busy days of technical education and  retail hours."
good,"Great to learn communication skills and retail enviroment, work place is heavily decided on management if your management is bad you will work 10 times harder due to lack of management skills or you will learn nothing."
good,"Very good company to work for, there is a lot of information that you need to learn however, which can be somewhat stressful."
good,"You will have a really fun time working here. You meet a lot of fun and interesting people and are sure to create life long friendships. If you were thinking to work here as a student, at times the job becomes stressful and overwhelming in maintaining a healthy work-life-school balance."
good,i enjoyed working at Best Buy because of the people I worked with. they were very helpful. good people to work with. enjoyed the challange that came with the job.
good,I believe the company itself is an amazing place to work at with great opportunities with the variety of positions. However it is a bit difficult to advance your career to other areas in the company based on the area in which you start and the quotas you may have to meet. the workplace is challenging and provides excellent skills that trains you in many areas which can help you grow and further progress your achievments.
good,"I worked for only half a year when I realized that I needed to find another job for the simple fact that almost every manager at the store I worked was leaving the company. Also when I was working there many of the managers were let go and then rehired as supervisors with much less pay to save the company some extra money. Workers are not paid commission, but are pushed to sell credit cards, protections plans, and merchandise as if they are. Best Buy is only good as a temporary place of employment to gain work experience otherwise look elsewhere for a serious career."
good,"Okay for a temp job, but I would not advise anyone who is pursuing a career in anything but corporate to stick with this company."
good,Training is not that great and the company really doesn't look to help people progress into something more than just a retail shift worker.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"if commute not bad, great and fun company to work for. sometimes can be stressful during black friday but thats expected for a retail environment"
good,This is a great place to work in if you are in school or trying to get your first sales job. Not high on pressure and they give you plenty of resources to learn your craft.
good,you learn to work as a team work in addition you learn about different type of divinity. they still need a lot of work related to management. the hardest part of the jobs when the customer asking you question and its not relate to the department you aren't working
good,"A typical day at work some are fun and easy going, basic upgrade, software installation and virus removal. While other days are very challenging, uncommon issues arises, hardware upgrade and difficult spyware and virus removal. "
good,"Their processes are really boring. They do not use new technology. Their systems are out of date. They are too worried something bad is going to happen, and do not allow for better processes to come to light to make things easier."
good,Every day is different and the people you work with are generally great. Good discounts and a ton of fun toys to play with.
good,Talk to various potential customers on a daily basis. Interacting with team members to maximize productivity. Also regular training exercises to enhance performance.
good,"Pros: Great workplace for a full time student that needs a side job etc, awesome company benefits. You meet awesome talented coworkers. "
good,"room for growth within company, there is some favortisim towards some employees; very easy retail job not as hectic and stressful as other retail companies"
good,"full time for peak season and after peak dropped to 8-20 hours a week.Needed to find full time work. Cleaned store,watched for theft on video,spider wrapped expensive items to deter theft/"
good,"worked here for a long time.  wasn't paid nearly enough at first for the amount of work that was expected.  A lot of leadership changes and job uncertainties.  Was told that I was at the top of my pay tier and wasn't able to make more, which turned out NOT to be the case and was one of the reasons I left."
good,Very limited advancement if you are picky about what you want.Fun place to work but plan on spending years to get where you want to be making very little money. It doesn't seem to matter how much experience or education you have.
good,Its all what you make it.  If you work hard you can definitely make a career for yourself here.  You will want to learn to take notes and keep up with your stuff.
good,"While I was only there for a seasonal position, my experience there wasn't the greatest. Despite telling them my schedule conflicts, the job given to me turned out to work graveyard hours and very limited with my school schedule. I didn't get paid my first month there because of some massive errors in the system that wouldn't recognize me as an official employee. The managers had a major lacking in presence when I needed help and communication, the environment was ok, employees were tolerable, the job would have been better for me under a different position."
good,best buy is a good place to work at if you are in school because they are very flexible with scheduling. They expect way to much out of the sales associates with no compensation. No commission but they do pay ok hourly rates
good,Was a great place to work. Even in the recent years with all the changes in business.  Recent upper management lost site of diversity of business ideas in local demographic areas needed to drive client retention and loyalty.
good,Fun environment to work in.  Have morning meetings to get everyone motivated! Used to play volleyball before work. Pro and Con is working with the public.
good,"Stock purchasing options, tuition reimbursement, employee discount.   Learned a lot about customer service, sales, and other skills that will help in future jobs."
good,They try work with ur schedule. bonus pay . however u have to keep getting credic cards weekly or they will cut ur hours. they are big about sales and required to be able to assist customers at any time.
good,"Advancement within the company is hard to come by, and most times going the extra mile is neither rewarded nor acknowledged. No benefits for part time workers, limited for full-time. Consistently worked over discussed limits. Extremely sales-oriented. Poor tool support."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Geek Squad was a great company to work for. During my time at Geek Squad i gained essential experience with handling and repairing computers. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I could provide a world class computer service experience for my clients. I also loved working with my co-workers. They have become my friends whom i still talk to on a daily basis.
good,"it was just helping customers, and stock. not much happened here, wasn't aloud to use the cash but was able to do everything as if I was an employee. I was in the gaming section of the store."
good,"I was responsible for wireless sales and giving great customer service to each customer. Also, I help translate or speak Spanish to those customers that need my help. I have to be knowledgeable in electronics and adapt to change very well."
good,"The biggest flaw Best Buy has is hiring and promoting people that aren't necessarily right for the job, but just because of the time they've put in with the company."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy includes helping customers, putting product out on the floor and occasionally doing carry outs for customers. I learned to never expect the same things to happen in the work place. The management is okay at the most. I have some very amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job is picking up the slack for the folks who work in customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on each and every customers face."
good,"All in all I'd say BestBuy is a fine company to work for. Very friendly work environment, and very team/goal oriented. Management was very good at coaching and teaching employees how to properly get the job done. Schedule was flexible with the exception of having to work one mandatory day out of the weekend. As far as Pay, it was decent for a ""retail"" job at the time, but it seemed that when it came to raises and advancement in the company favoritism superseded actual qualifications. I'd say this is an ideal job for students in school."
good,Best Buy was a good place to work. The worst part about this job were the weekend and holiday hours which most employees are required to work every year.
good,A typical day working at best buy is pretty laid back. Management expects you to be able to fix any problems on your own. I answer the phones and help the customers get what they need sometimes other stores mess up orders and send the customers to us
good,"Usual sales jobs but was often lacking employees, frequent complaints from customers would support it. As part-time hire i was receiving 30 hours a week, often kept on edge of full-time employment."
good,Typical retail chain store. A lot of employees that come and go. No life during Holiday season and have to work on Thanksgiving. Pay was decent for retail. Discount is only good part.
good,"Best Buy pays pretty good. Helped me get through school. Good discounts for employees. Hours are good, depending on if you are full time or part time. Decent job."
good,"In my tenure at Best Buy, I have had the wonderful opportunity to retain different positions across the company. That has allowed me to grow and have a complete understanding of how a national retailer operates."
good,"I typically work rotating shifts, so my lifestyle has to be very flexible due to this.  I enjoy the atmosphere, and interacting with customers on a daily basis.  What is most challenging in my current role is overcoming obstacles without the help of leadership.  I take it upon myself to do what I can to maintain a positive employee and customer experience with little to no resources."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, not so great on job security."
good,"The only real challenge comes on black friday. Your job then is to go around and help customers find what they need. I was instructed to keep doing this past that holiday then got complained about by other employees because I was doing so. The first day I got there, I was told that I should quit and find a different job. When I approached management, they stated that the employee would be dealt with. That employee received no consequences and repeated in telling me that I should quit often."
good,"My work experience in Canada has been rewarding because I learned different techniques servcio customers has helped me improve my service every day"
good,"Many great products and different variety of items "
good,"Started part-time, worked with a lot of amazing and fun people. great work environment but not a lot of room for full-time employees or further advancement."
good,"Each position has a ""cap,"" and the sales are non-commission. This makes it hard to really strive to do any better than you need to, because the closer you get to that cap the smaller your raises become, regardless of what your value may be. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Overall, Best Buy is not a bad company to work for, if you get the right store with the right managers. Consistency it's not Best Buy's strong point. "
good,I have learned to be a good salesmen at best buy Canada the environment is very positive and there is no negative pressure to perform
good,"My job consisted of sitting at a desk, taking in calls. I meant customers from all over the area which was interesting. My associates were nice and helpful."
good,just mostly helped out with customers with purchases and answered any questions they had. Also attended maintenance when needed as well.
good,"Best Buy was Ok. They play a lot of favoritisism. If you're not their buddy, they will not give you hours, and they will treat you terribly."
good,"Retail mindset, talent, and majority of sales reps from stores. Still heavily focused on retail and transaction selling. Too many barriers and retail culture overrides channel/B2B standard practices where competition has a huge advantage to win business and partake in channel/vendor perks."
good,had a great time. great deals. should pay more. favorite part of the day was clocking out. hardest part was punching in. i have nothing more to say
good,Best Buy is a great job for a person needing to build sales experience. You will learn how to read people and convert knowledge to works quickly.
good,Unless you want to be in management I would not recommend staying long term. It was an ok part-time job that worked well with my school schedule. Holiday Season is a no time-off zone. Good luck making it to your family on X-mas and Thanksgiving if they are hours away because the very next day you may have to work.
good,"I loved working in this company because I was able to help people find the right product that they needed. Plus being able to help them, made me happy. This place was located in Hawthorne ca."
good,"Retail store, it's not different than any other retail job. There are good days and bad days. I did learn quite a bit working here and caught the technology bug."
good,if a student this is a great company to work for. will help with schooling and also work around your schedule. can sometimes feel like high school but it also feels like a second family and management is nice. hardest part is when working on a order that is complicated so you are trying to fix it with the bride and making the client happy. sometimes clients get mad and curse at you but management has your back and helps resolve issue well. coworkers are great cause its a second family and you always see them so bonds form and feels like home. always learning about new product and how they work and there benefits and downsides.
good,"É uma empresa nova,tinha acabado de se estrear no mercado português,notava um pouco a falta de organização,a relação funcionar patrão não era das melhores"
good,"Not much upside, good if you need a mediocre part time or a nice discount. Management is terrible, and a waste of time contacting HR."
good,"Since this was my first job as a repair technician, it was a good learning experience for me. Also i got along well with the my colleagues and enjoyed working there."
good,Great place to work with the opportunity to advance if you put your best foot forward.  Best Buy has a lot of perks and great vendor relationships.
good,it was okay job i was just a cashier so i did not do much. was kind of boring standing around all day. it was nice being around technology.
good,"good work environment, but low hourly rates, overall the employee atmosphere is well rounded and friendly. i would recommend teens coming out of high school for this job."
good,Can move up through the ranks if you are willing to relocate. Can be very stressful during the holiday season.  Ability to make a great salary compared to other retail companies.
good,I liked working for Best Buy it was a very good company to work for the managers were ok people to work for I had a fun time working for the company.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Reps forget to eat lunch because for the commission structure. The DMs are sales leads themselves. They should all be car salesmans.
good,"great place to learn the ins and outs or general retail sales, and stocking. Served as a great platform to sharpen my customer service skills, and leadership qualities."
good,"Lack of strong management, fairly laid back environment with good perks and good people. Hours can vary extremely especially in the slower months."
good,Was giving a chance to meet a wide variety of people from all different parts of New York city. It was a Phenomenal experience>
good,"The company grosses billions of dollars in profits every year. Employees are paid near minimum wage with no benefits. Lot's of company propaganda, employees are just numbers."
good,"Being properly prepared, educated and understanding the risk involved so that the risk can be reduced to a manageable level."
good,"Yo era responsable de aperturar tienda fungiendo actividades de gerencia, organizaba una charla matutina para compartir los resultados del dia anterior al equipo de tienda, me encargaba ademas de hacer el arqueo de cajas y asegurar todo estuviera listo antes de aperturar tienda esto incluia experiencias encendida, precios actualizados,frenteo de producto, resurtido. Durante el dia era responsable de alrededor de 14 personas de 4 areas diferentes (mercadeo, inventarios, prevencion, swatt) siendo responsable de ellos debia capacitarles, de manera diaria asignaba actividades adicionales a las que se hacian comunmente, supervisaba su ejecucion, me aseguraba de que se recibiera y enviara mercancia correctamente, supervisar el correcto acomodo y orden en bodegas, ejecucion de planogramas, conectividad, experiencias de tienda funcionales, encargada del personal de mantenimiento, temas de seguridad, brigadistas y simulacros. Aprendi a trabajar en equipo, a tener buena comunicacion con todos, saber dirigirme a ellos, ser un buen lider. La gerencia era responsable de dar los numeros de tienda a traves del trabajo de los supervisores y empleados, por lo que se hacia un plan estrategico  se trabajaba en base a los presupuestos. Mis colegas y yo siempre trabajamos muy de la mano, logramos hacer un buen equipo y ayudarnos mutuamente para lograr los resultados de tienda. La parte mas dificil del trabajo eran los horarios ya que en ocasiones me tocaba trabajar de noche, fines de semana obligatorios y 10 a 11 horas diarias. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo  son los valores que se viven, el ambiente"
good,It is a very demanding job especially during the holiday season. Management sometimes expect too much out of their employees.
good,"Often given opportunities to showcase interpersonal skills, but for the most part not much more than a retail job. Sometimes tasks are not delegated accordingly amongst team members."
good,fun place to work but no stable hours management doesn't handle employee problems properly management talks big pay is above normal for the work required
good,Good part-time job that helped with maintaining a balanced sense of customer service. The leadership at my particular store was excellent.
good,"Working on the Project Team a typical day would be working on planograms. This job is really a merchandising job which an employee would basically set products or displays where it is assigned to in the store. Another task would be adding or changing signs throughout the stores. If the employee works for the over night team he or she will travel within the district. The overnight Project Teams are the ones who are responsible for changing the layout of the store. Basically removing products from one section of the store to another, tearing down/ building isles, and setting up displays. Basically the overnight team will have the heavy workload compared to the day team. The day team work in the morning and are mostly assigned to one or two stores. The overnight team will travel on average 60-300 miles or possibly further. Also the team is normally 3 weeks out at a time in single job. One more thing is that overnight project team members are barely home. So for individuals who are single and have no kids, then this would be a fun and good job for him or her."
good,"I worked as both Asset Protection, and as a Sales Associate."
good,"Management at store 335 was terrible. They did not adhere to company SOPs and that is why I left. I was happy with the day to day operations, and learned a lot before current management took over."
good,"Good place to work when management is good. Currently management isn't that great, not enough people working there to support the work that needs to be done."
good,Learned a lot about wifi and hot spots for computers.  This job was very customers focus.  It was a demanding job but the staff was very helpful with everything.
good,Working for this company was a good experience over all. I gained valuable management skills through there management training program. the people I worked with were absolutely phenomenal and that was probably the best part of the job. The hardest was the constant turn over of upper management. There was never really an opportunity to build re pore with direct supervisors because of the moves in departments or because they were being replaced constantly with new personnel.
good,"The cool thing about working at best buy is the technology you have access to. the only down side is that, its really not used to bring the customers in. Meaning if I'm a customer and i want to purchase an iPad, its stuck to a table and i have to bend down and play with it. instead of it being interactive."
good,"In the right location.  Best Buy is a pretty fun place to work...  That being said, it can also be fairly disenchanting in a location where management & employee turnover is fairly regular."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,a day working at best buy was very exciting to me getting to work with great people and doing the job i loved i could not complain
good,"The workplace was very disorganized and I was barely getting hours. I learned how to sell and properly talk to best buy customers, up to the managers liking.The co-workers were friendly and very helpful, the hardest part was dealing with the managers and consistently having problems with my hours and the days I was suppose to be working."
good,"Opening and closing the store, stocking, managing customer affairs, handling finances, and making myself aware of new company changes and updates as well as becoming knowledgable on any new products."
good,"When i first started working at best buy i loved it there but then they changed management and it went down hill. They don't allow you to grow with in the company because the managers won't even give you a chance to interview if your not a ""favorite"". The pay is also terrible, I've been there for over 3 years and get paid less then 10 dollars. Mangers take advantage of you and they are grimy, you have to watch your back there."
good,Great company to work for. The atmosphere is great and the employees are fun to work with as well. There are great incentives as a Best Buy employee.
good,You can make it a fun place to work if you're willing.  Although it is all about the numbers to judge on how you grow and develop with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is working and helping the customers. There is a high turnover rate due to colleagues moving on to other ventures and going to school so it was hard to get to know new people. My position was beginning to get monotonous after being there for over eight years with no new tasks or projects put upon me.
good,"The team is good and it is fun most of the time. Holidays are incredibly stressful. The customers can be frustrating at times, and the sales culture."
good,"The job was fun for employees. But you could also see the structural problems of management and the way the company operated from the ground floor employee level. From the sales floor, you could see redundancies and customer behaviour that made you question how the company was making money sometimes. And this eventually led to the falling of Future Shop (similar model)."
good,It was a good place to work and helped me out learning new areas. Worked there many times and enjoy going back every year during the busy season.
good,Company is a fun place to work but many inconsistent practices.  Constant change. Good employee network programs.  Company interested in supporting veterans better but still need to improve programs.
good,Good people to work with but management did not respect most part time employees. Not so much the CEO but people below him made things hard. Also a lot of lying just to sell an item which didn't settle well with me.
good,This company is a high energy and fun workplace. The hardest part about what I did for them is someday's we got a car that would take 8 hours to work on. My co-workers were great and fun.
good,A great place to work and learn all the new technology out in the world. You will be meet a lot of great and fun people throughout your Best Buy journey.
good,"It was a pleasure working for Best Buy. This job defiantly improved my critical thinking, and time management skills. High level training and employee empowerment. The company's culture is the best part of working with your teams are very exciting most of the time. The day to day challenges of dealing with stores across the nation, and in Puerto Rico provided me with a large network off associates that provided valuable knowledge. This Knowledge I used to sharpen my overall business acumen in productions and operations."
good,scan boxes put labels on then place on conveyer to shipping to then be loaded onto truck to arrive at stores for customers to purchase
good,The people were nice and the company was well structure but i applied because it wasn't commission so i wasn't pressured to sell things to people who didn't need them. Then the management began to apply pressure that i didn't believe in.
good,"Normal benefits available. quite Stressful job"
good,"consisted of multiple different jobs, shipping receiving, returns of damaged good, testing damaged goods, re packaging. Friend environment."
good,"What was a valuable brand and business turned into nothing more than general customer service for anything that plugged in, in addition degraded true mission of GS by having us do general customer service tasks such as price match, selling, and appraisal of trade in items."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"very good company to work with equally in professional and in personal very supportive staff and excellent work culture."
good,"A fun place to work as long as you keep your mouth shut. Management really doesn't care about employee advancement unless you are willing to kiss. Honest and constructive criticism is taken personally and people in higher management just enjoy doing the meetings."
good,I've had a great 4 years working with Best Buy.I worked with a lot of great people. I feel that I was a great asset to their company on a  day to day basis. No complaints with my work experience at Best Buy
good,"It was a fun place to work for. It wasn't full time, so no benefits. Mostly stocked shelves when the trucks came in, did the Sunday ad set, and displayed product when the planogram changed. Coworkers changed kind of frequently due to nature of the job."
good,It was fun to work their cause of the co-workers and management. You learn a lot about technology and how it makes easier for a person.Management was always respectful and if someone made a mistake they never talk to you like you where a kid.Co-workers where a lot of fun to work with and we always came up with a game plan for the department.The hardest thing in that work place was that one a co-worker went to their break or lunch and they werent no one to cover that their department they sent you to cover and you didnt no anything about the product.It was always a pressure and fun place to work their during the holiday season.
good,best buy is a fun place to work if you're very interested in electronics and like to help people with their technological questions. You learn not only about today's technology but more about what is going to be coming in the future.
good,"Management gave me work hours at night so I could work my other job in the morning."
good,Co-workers are the only thing fun about this place. Management throws multiple tasks at you at once with no time to complete them.
good,Management has always been a issue and always will be. But the job itself is a good job especially for teens or college students.
good,"I showed great customer service and leadership skills"
good,Difficult to get management help because they are always on the customers side. Typical day include following orders from management and the hardest part of the job are the customers.
good,There was a lot of variety in days work. A lot of politics.Co- workers were helpful. Best part was to deal with different types/ cultures of customers coming in the store.
good,"Come into work, lay phone on counter. Walk to desk, begin deconstructing MAC hardware.When finessed, turn into refurbishing,"
good,There was no real training . I was thrown in my first day on black friday with no knowledge of products. I was on a learn as you go basis
good,Worked 14 hour days at times 16 hour days in acclimate weather to get the job done efficiently and safely. Supportive Management and we had a very strong staff.
good,"Team work has been one of the greatest aspect of the job. The teams I've been a part of have been able to grow and adapt seamlessly. Learning about new technology, usually before the public has also been very exciting."
good,"Sold Phones and accesories."
good,"Good company to work for. There is a lot of room for growth, especially if you live in the Twin Cities area. Cares way too much about numbers, and management usually isn't great. Policies for getting rid of bad employees are too strict, so you usually have some terrible coworkers they will not get rid of."
good,"Most associates are fun to work with. Depending on the location, there may be a lot of politics to deal with. Many individuals get passed up for position due to friendships despite their qualifications. If you love retail and sales then you will love working here. Don't be afraid to move from store to store, many district and territorial managers look for individuals who have worked from the bottom to the top at various locations. Just don't get stuck..."
good,Would not want to work here unless It was my only choice.  The hours are long and you are on your feet the entire time.  Holidays are busy and unless you enjoy working in retail you will not enjoy this.  It is a somewhat cool environment with the new stuff that comes out but pay is pretty standard.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I must say, I love the job and the people I work with! However, it is in my opinion for all of the knowledge that I posses about certain daily activities that we are required; they do not compensate with pay. I have been there, now going on three years and I'm not complaining about anything except for the pay for the issues at hand for a multi-channel sales representative."
good,"I worked here before the recent recession. Therefore, my experience is both good and bad. In general, the experience is one I am grateful to have in my life and sorry that I had some of the experiences while there. The culture at the time was awesome! The training was constant and never-ending, but I was always informed. The best employee discounts on products and services ever! Employee benefits at the time were incredible! Great employee stock purchase plan, 401K plan, and vacation time! Always had to work holidays, weekends, but its retail, so have to expect that if you're full time."
good,"Work was great, 99% of the people were fantastic. Although, management needed improvement in employee relationships and day-to-day training as business needs changed each day. The best thing about working at Citi were the people and customers. The hardest thing about the job was dealing with all the rules that apply in the credit card industry. I learned; not all can be trained with caring about other people."
good,very involved on all day to day management tasks. Continue to strive for success and meet daily weekly and monthly goals
good,"Best Buy pays their leadership team well, but the work/life balance is horrible. Weekends off are non existent. Best Buy provides training for sales associates, but should do more things to make sure their leaders receive adequate training as well."
good,It is a great experience to have a Management team that leads by example and puts great emphasis on the importance of the employees. Also a work environment where we all are able to grow as individuals and as a company.
good,"Helping people while during school, learning how to listen to people and dealing with other peoples problems. Best Buy was a good company."
good,"No room for advance, but the job is stable and manager is willing to work with your school schedule. Great 1st job for anyone looking to gain some real life experience."
good,"Opportunity to learn and grow, change departments, management potential after a LONG stint with the company. VERY poor work-life balance"
good,Working with technology is a plus for a retail position but management at the time was not very strong. Poor communication between departments and chain of command.
good,"Fun place to work but strong on numbers and overall production."
good,It is a good company to start but it is also a big corporation and you might get lost with low visibility. Fun co workers and management.
good,Overall a good place to work.  A productive work environment that made the job easy and a solid group of people to work with.
good,"Working at Best Buy was like being in high school all over again."
good,Fun place to work but most upper management terrible and clueless as to everyday activities. Very high turnover rate due to displeased employees
good,"Great company to work for, plenty of entry-level opportunities. However my time was short-lived and I didn't stay long enough to really get a good feel of how the company was. Great manager, cool coworkers and decent pay. Not terribly difficult to move up in the company if you want to."
good,"Best Buy has a wide variety of products that they sell within their company, as well as teaching their employees how to sell those products. They have a variety of opportunities and learning outlets within their company."
good,"This is a great place to work for seasonal employment, part time etc while you are a student. The management in store can sometimes be lackluster in communication and the pay isn't phenomenal but you can learn and gain experience in sales and service and support. And if you love tech can’t beat this place to be surrounded by it."
good,comerstormer oriented and focus on sales for profit.  great employee discount.  did not work there very long because of katrina
good,"Best Buy is great starting point if your passion is technology.  However, you may regret working for this company over time.  Favortism and double-talk are the norms and implementing productivity goals looks more like sales goals without using the dreaded word commission.  Discounts are amazing but if this is your primary job, you may not be able to afford to take advantage of it."
good,"The store that i work for has no respect for there employees, I understand that the sales team is there to sell but to try to cram a sale down some customers through even when it is a non commission store its pretty ridiculous."
good,I would help customers to the best of my abilities. Management was strict and rewarding. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was finding items in the unorganized warehouse. The most enjoyable part was the tanks i received from a customers after helping them with their purchase.
good,"The job started well, but now I'm looking for other work while I finish my degree.  The pay is decent, and coworker are friendly"
good,i was employed with best buy for almost 4 years. i enjoyed my time there the only down fall about this job is that you don't get paid enough for what you do even if you're the top sales person for a whole year. The only reason why i was there for 4 years was because my job was secured and i had a bond with my co workers other than that the pay is horrible.
good,"Genuinely helping clients with issues with their computers are a pleasure. Unfortunately, there're hardly any customers like that and most feel entitled for every little thing. The problem is the ratio between the good clients who really need help and the bad clients who just want free stuff (and usually gets them). Management does a poor job of dealing with the ""entitled"" clients. It's usually a warning to the client that they're making an ""exception"" and then goes about giving them free or heavily discounted things. The best part of this job is actually the other agents. Since every agent understands the stress that comes with this job, the chemistry between us is well balanced."
good,"fast paced, timed drive thru"
good,Working for this company is great. They provide great hourly pay and quite a few benefits. The people there are fun to work with.
good,"Its a fun job but very little opportunity to advance and management changes often."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of training and supervising a team of technicians and managing their productivity, as well as, managing any customer issues."
good,"Responsible for ringing up customer purchases"
good,"It was a fun place to work. They will continue to keep great momentum for all employees, especially during the holidays."
good,"What can be said?  You work retail hours (which is crazy during Black Friday weekend and Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years holidays), and deal with the general public (both good and bad).  But I did learn a lot about computer repair (hardware and software), and got really good at removing malware and optimizing performance."
good,"The managers were cool, I got hemmed up in a heap of drama & left because of it. I worked at Geek Squad, and I handled computer check-ins."
good,I caught on to the processing fast my co-workers were very helpful. I didn't like that people had been working there years and expected you to move at their past the same day.
good,"great company, very fun, the people are fun and the job for the most part was fun. they could pay a little better but other than that great company"
good,Decent pay for a first time job. Not many opportunities to move up. Management was not very good. Work environment was often overly competitive because of very stern sales goals.
good,"A typical day working at Best Buy consisted of helping customers find the items they need, as well as helping them make their purchases. The best part of working at Best buy were the job benefits that came along with being an employee there."
good,"-Go after revenue "
good,"I worked with best buy for almost a year and a half. I worked Home Theater and Warehouse in multiple positions. I was paid low but more than other employees. I was Full Time and the benefits were actually good but I wasn't aware at the time. I got overtime every week. Out of a 5 day work week, I easily worked 50-60 hours every week. Typically because I was a warehouse associate for most of my tenure and trucks would take all day long and sometimes days long"
good,Working at the Best Buy was a good experience. It was a memorable experience as it introduced me to technology in depth. Management was very polite and open to ideas for employee development.
good,"Work was fun and exhausting. Trying to get a customer to understand why you can't take back something, that they spent thounsands of dollars on , but didn't need was hard."
good,in the beginning everything was fine until we started getting no breaks and mandatory overtime. when asked for fulltime they didnt want to give it but always had overtime
good,BBYM allows for quite a bit of freedom in helping the customer. They also generally believe strongly in training. They'll send you to trainings across the country to make sure you're at your best.
good,"It was an interactive experience. I was working in the holiday season so it was incredibly busy. While we were not motivated by commission on the sale, the environment was very competitive."
good,"Typical day is booking appointments and rooms, ordering catering, reconciling expenses, booking travel arrangements, scheduling meetings and taking meeting minutes, preparing photocopies and other requests. Management are very approachable and require your nurturing attention and are caring and grateful for all your effort. Co-workers are very helpful, bright, quick and all smiles! Some departments are not connected while others are close knit. Hardest part is the multi-tasking between multiple competing priorities while trying to satisfying everyone but sometimes satisfying only a few. Also, lots of hard work and long hours put in for this company. The most enjoyable part was meeting the fun personalities in this company and feeling the people are approachable with a comical and quirky sense of humour."
good,"Working at Best Buy I felt as if I was working for a cult. All employees and managers try to hang out, outside of work. Chants and pep rallies before each shift. Very young and not very knowledgeable staff. Mostly College kids trying to get by."
good,Overall great enviorment to work in; but Managment struggled with communication to employees. I learned a great deal about up to date technology. My Co-workers were very easy to get along with.
good,"some people kept the job for the discount, i stayed as long as i did for the amazing people that supported me. customer service doesn't change from place to place, but i can't find these same wonderful ""blue shirts"" anywhere else!"
good,"Since it is retail, hours are all over the place on. There are sales goals daily but the main point for it is to ensure the customers are being taking care of."
good,"I learned Customer interaction skills, and register. I worked in at the cash register. I stocked the soda's and candy every day. I also helped with some destines of what candy should be placed where based on product sales."
good,"Great place to interact with customers and showcase my customer service skills. I learned how to supervise a large stafff and how to organize and run weekly meetings. Management was very supportive and always there to help. The job became difficult when customers expected too much in return to issues they had with there product or order, being management was very supportive they were always there to assist in these rare occasions. I enjoyed meeting allot of people and building lifelong relationships."
good,Fun place to work and was great if you like big box retail and other such things. Discount was pretty good and store was busy
good,"If you like to work constantly, this is a place for you. It's fun to work here, but if you can't handle impossible to educate customers... this is not a place for you to work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"If you're into technology, and like to learn about new products this is a great place to work. Management is the same I believe in every job, you have some good ones, and then you have some bad ones."
good,"A typical day at work involved diagnosing and repairing everyday personal computers and equipment."
good,"During my time at Best Buy I was very frustrated by the management group and their lack of trust in employees abilities to execute. People were marked and if you got on the wrong side of a director you were pretty much done. I personally could not get out of there any faster. That being said, I know that many changes have happened there over the last 10 years so take the review with that in mind."
good,"you learn about luxury sales, build great relationship with your reps.  not a lot of hands on training, need to be motivated to work hard and make money"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work if you're starting off, possibly without a degree. Typical work/life struggle in any retail environment, of course holidays, etc always crazy. I did receive tuition reimbursement which allowed me to knock out my last 10 classes for my degree, which came in really handy... but not sure if it's been changed since I worked there. Typically sales and customer service were hired externally and started off around $8-10 an hour. This may have gone up since I work there. Within a couple years, I had moved up several times, but restructures caused me to have to apply for different jobs almost every 6 months to a year. Felt I was treated fairly by management overall, just don't get emotionally hung up on your job there. When the company isn't doing well, it cuts hours and positions quickly."
good,great place to work not many hours the staff seemed like they had favorites and if you wernt one then you got no hours I really liked doing this job and the hours were great
good,helping customers and being able to show off the new devices all in one place. I also like the team I work with we all help each other out when it comes to our customers.
good,I stocked shelves for the store during the Christmas season. I was laid off after Christmas. It was the kind of work I like doing by that I mean unloading trucks. I just did my job.
good,"It was an excellent opportunity to showcase my acquired LAN/WAN/PC knowledge. The management team was on par with what was expected of them. Provided an excellent staff room, complete with vending machines, coffee makers, tv. And free lunches were sometimes added as incentives to drive sales up."
good,"Just an average retail job. Easy to get to know people, friendly environment. A lot to know about policies but nothing too difficult. Management was easy to deal with. There are favorites in the company though."
good,"When i first came on at best buy i was still young, looking to prove myself, and there was a lot of excitement as you start up with any job."
good,"A typical day at work in the current position I hold consists of a lot of paper work. I start the day off by completing counts sent by corporate and even some i create myself. With any variance (positive or negative) I research why there is a variance and who caused it as to maintain and accurate shrink number and culture."
good,"You'll have fun working at Best Buy, the managers really care about their employees and really want to see them having fun while getting the work done."
good,"PC Home and Office Sales Associate"
good,"Best Buy is a retail company, so it's expected that this will not be a fantastic place to work."
good,"Demanding place to work, not everyone comes in to shop . It's like a Place for people to gawk at all the cool things raging in high volumes all at once. All the newest gear and sounds, it just keeps peoples interest going sky high. Not saying there will be nothing to do , but sometimes its slow. Managers aren't the nicest, they have quotas to follow."
good,I was only with Best Buy seasonally so I did not have much time to learn the complete in and outs of their daily workings. During my time there though I did meet some wonderful co-workers and managers. Everyone was happy with their job for the most part and eager to help the customers that came into the store. The hardest part of the job was the lack of job security due to being seasonally employed. Otherwise it was a pleasant and productive job experience overall.
good,"Best Buy is a company that wants you to experience the fun and glory of technology and the fun toys.  You get hands on experience with tablets, PCs, gaming consoles, music, and full on home entertainment system with Magnolia.  There is also the Apple and Samsung in-store mini-shops with Apple and Samsung sales professionals to help you with their product.  The Best Buy Mobile store has all carries and will help best pick which is the proper choice."
good,Best Buy is a company that leads to many new and different opportunities. I for one have spent quite a while in the company and have seen many people go on to do many different things.
good,"Technical support role in a retail environment. Plenty of customer traffic, opportunities for sales and technical tasks. Fast paced environment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management and staff were all very safe-conscious even so productivity was main goal.  A safe working environment was a high priority.  On the other hand, training and job awareness was very thorough because it was completed by the most experienced and/or amicable and knowledgeable employees in on the job situations.  Furthermore, new personnel were required to view training and safety videos, in addition to pass tests.  Nonetheless, teamwork was great for productivity!  "
good,Your coworkers become a family as you all learn to get together and talk about how the management doesn't follow through on many needs and demands of the employees. Company policy seems fly by night as well.
good,"Good company to work for, just left due to being passed up for an advancement.Working environment  was safe, friendly, and very willing to teach you information."
good,"You have to receive inventory into the system, get product put out from receiving or trucks within 24 hours, check functionality of store's displays, complete planograms, and load/unload shuttles and trucks."
good,management does not like to work with students. had a scheduling conflicts with class due to poor management. I retired from the position to finish school. overall good customer experience bad experience with management .
good,"I worked as a third party sales representative for Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. I was responsible for finding the right plan and carrier for the customer as well as upgrading them to new devices. I was also responsible for finishing planograms for my whole department. It was an ok job, hated the pay but loved the people."
good,"i really dont have anything to say about best buy other than it wasn't my ideal occupation. Unless your a optimistic and empathetic person to deal with retail and sales then go all out for it, other than that i wouldn't put it in my bucket list quote on quote."
good,"My job duites at Best Buy was to complete cash,credit and check transaction for customers purchasing items and protection plans for tvs, computers and phones."
good,"I've worked several positions with the company, in several different stores, across several different states over the course of two and a half years, All from sales to asset protection to merchandising/inventory. Most of management is easy to get along with, as with any company, you will have some that aren't. Like wise with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the repetitiveness of my daily duties. The part I enjoy most is the sense of family that is commonly created within stores/teams that you work with."
good,"fast pace, fun, open to change and diversity. management is a good supportive team. co workers are consistent. hardest part of the job is accepting the pay. being in a fun fast pace environment."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of runing a register, constantly persuading customers to apply for credit cards and preocessin multiple returns and exchanges. I management did their job to a bare minimum and everyone seemed to only work there for the employee discount."
good,"Best Buy offers great benefits, and great people to work with. The overall work experience depends on which location you're at."
good,Fast paced environment. Never stop going! Playing with new tech is always a perk. Great team to work with. New goals every 30 minutes.
good,"Good job to be in, gives you the opportunity to develop as an individual. I enjoy meeting and talking to new people, it allows your days to go by faster."
good,"After spending eight years with Best Buy, I unfortunately won't be returning. It's a great place to work when your younger, but not a place I would recommend starting a career. The compensation isn't the best and the hours make it hard to keep a balanced life outside of work."
good,"A typical day involved receiving shipment from a delivery truck, entering it into the inventory system, and pushing the product out onto the sales floor, as well as managing ingoing and outgoing orders.  Management was supportive as well as all the other warehouse associates.  The hardest part of the job was running these tasks with a low number of employees.  The most enjoyable was clearing out a large shipment daily."
good,Great place to be. Sometimes its too much work for such little pay. Great place to meet friends. Very Diverse Culture among coworkers.
good,"It's next to impossible to advance within Best Buy if you're not one of the manager's favorite employees. The only reason to work there is if you shop there a lot. But beware, the temptations of the employee discount might keep you around a lot longer than you'd like to be."
good,limited hours with limited pay.  no commission added to base pay so it is hard to build a solid career there.  nice people and great training.  nice job for early sales experience.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Nous avions une belle équipe au travail. Les employés étaient très dynamique ce qui créait un environnement très enthousiaste.
good,"Best Buy was my first job and I stayed and moved up with the company over 5 years. The year I left there were a lot of cut backs, hours and salaries took a hit."
good,"buena empresa, el ambiente lo hacen los empleados"
good,"Best Buy was a great opportunity, I learned a lot.  Unfortunately it was not a good fit for my life at the time.  I always make the best of every situation and learn from those around me and that is what i did."
good,"At the beginning it was a great place to work, but eventually you realize that management have preferences with some employees. Even they hire people they know!! And these new employees have many benefits and better pay."
good,"Best buy was a good entry level job, but this job will get really old overtime. Oh yea! Say goodbye to all of your holidays and vacations."
good,"The management was very sloppy. You are given daily sales goals that hold little to no weight. If you complete or exceed your sales goal you may receive a smile, if you don't you will be lectured. However, there isn't any benefit to completing them. The hardest part of the job was the management never being satisfied."
good,Getting to play with the newest technology is awesome. Selling it to people can be awesome too. More training for sales floor would be nice.
good,"Being able to sell in multiple departments, being able to interact with multiple culture groups. Teaches you how to deal with certain types of people."
good,"I have been at Best Buy for the past almost three years. Overall it is a good company to work for. The benefits are good, pay is decent, and the discounts are good as well as the vendor perks. Work days are very busy, and somewhat physically and mentally demanding. I have learned a lot about how to lead people and team building, and the management teams are diverse and mostly fair. The hardest part of the job is always having to work weekends especially if your a manager. I really seeing the smile on peoples faces when they buy something they really want and feel like they received excellent customer service."
good,"Best buy is ok except need more money, benifits, hours"
good,"applied for a cashier job and was quickly put in customer service. I hated doing customer service and jumped at the chance to be on front lanes whenever I could because it was much less boring there. management is on huge ego trips, but they're all mostly harmless and laid back. one annoying thing is being kept way past the time you're supposed to close- for no reason. I cannot tell you the number of times I had to stay for an hour past what I was scheduled after I had finished doing all my closing duties. I would just stand around until my supervisor told me I could go. as a student with homework and things to do, this was not ideal at all."
good,selling computers was not that fun but they make it as fun as possible. training with new devices and technology was always a fun experience.
good,"Clean place polite people greetings"
good,"As a Consultation Agent (CA) at Geek Squad you're expected to evaluate a client's needs based on a quick 15 minute session and sell them corresponding services to fix the issues they're having. We service Smart Phones, Tablets, Macs, PCs (even had a DOS Desktop come in one day!). "
good,"Best Buy has their issues, but generally speaking they are trying to address them. So far I have enjoyed my time there, I just need something a little more stable."
good,"I really enjoy working for the company. There are many, many things that I like and wouldn't change for anything. The overall store environment is very friendly and fun to be in."
good,"Best Buy is a world wide known company. It is busy year round, it is competitive and never a dull moment. It is a company that strives to have fun while being the best."
good,Good entry level job. Not much responsibility other than assisting customers. Management was fair and rarely interfered in day to day operations. The employee discount was excellent. I have yet to see anyone exceed what they were offering employees.
good,Easy job with good people to work for. money wasn't great but that is to be expected
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,A typical day for me would start with the unloading of a truck for restocking the store and/or displaying of new products. Following plans already mapped out we would display and stock items accordingly. After displaying and stocking the products all products would be priced to match our advertised sales papers. The hardest part of the job was completing large projects during store hours all the while assisting customers. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with my hands and being up to date on all the latest technology.
good,Worked with customers to find what they are looking for in the newest technology.
good,Helping customers discover their unknown needs and then sell them on it. Mandatory to work on Black Friday which was a nightmare.
good,"In seven years working here, I was promoted, and demoted, promoted again, and was kept from gaining any advancement because I stood my own ground with the company's policies and procedures, for this, I was confronted.  I left because after all this, and being a leader, coaching, nurturing a team to increase productivity, while keeping it fun, and performing above acceptable guidelines, getting promoted on my own merits was not enough ."
good,"its a good place to work at for students,as being non-commission; customers have no pressure of getting one particular system. Managers are great, work is easy (at the entry level), its all customer service plus product knowledge but sometimes we have to sell our services along with the product and being honest it is some kind of pressure that our managers give us to sell ""His""  commission based services out of which we get nothing."
good,"Management at the store I worked was woefully incompetent.  There were several weeks where I wasn't even put on the schedule until I told them they didn't schedule me.  And I would be added for the last three days of the week.  I was the only AP who actually did my job, and was repeatedly told I wasn't doing my job because I didn't fill out my AP to sales agent survey twice.  New General Manager was completely clueless, rude, and harassed employees daily and acted inappropriately."
good,The hardest part of my job here was getting customers to sign up for store magazines and credit cards.
good,Good work experience. Great to develop a good business acumen and how to sale effectively.
good,"I learned from working with Best Buy that retail was not for me."
good,Best Buy was a good place to work if you enjoy spending time educating customers and having conversations about technology and computer products.
good,Best Buy is definitely a place where you're more lucrative during the 2n half of the year. It's not somewhere you want to be too long.
good,"Demands are high with low wages. Expected to sell a certain amount of services while repairing all of the computers checked in for service. I did learn a great deal about virus removal and registry repair during my stint. Management didn't understand our workload, making it difficult to deal with, The most enjoyable part of the job was fixing a customer's computer and seeing a smile on their face."
good,"Working at Best Buy was a good way to add work experience to my life. I had originally applied for customer service and was put at the register every day. For the most part, managers were very understanding and sympathetic. Though the pressures to meet attachment goals and credit apps were tough, I enjoyed conversations with my coworkers on down time and making the most of my employment there."
good,"cool toys "
good,Started with Accenture for Best Buy as a contract working through Volt. It lead to a perm job and was a great opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work as an Advanced Repair Agent at Geek Ssquad consists of servicing multiple computers (Mac or PC) at once while assisting other agents with client communication and support when needed. Though it can sometimes feel overwhelming to someone who may not be accustomed to fast paced computer repairs, it is a great vessel for education and experience in terms of both the IT field and customer/client support field."
good,"-Freedom."
good,A typical day at Best Buy was a lot of customer interactions. Customer service by assisting customer with their needs. Talking to customers about the different computer products processers and software. I learned the differences in computer hardware processors memory and hard drives. Management kept a pressure filled environment to meet sales goals everyday as well as other duties as far as maintaining the department. I enjoyed working with my co-workers in the store. Meeting my sales goal was a challenge everyday because some days would be slower than others. I enjoyed working with customers and teaching them about computers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Disorganized and needs improvement at that level. Great people to work with besides managers
good,"- Checking in client's computers and assisting in repairing them."
good,I had fun working for BestBuy Musical Instruments. I was sad to see it close down.
good,It's retail and exactly what you think it is.  A lot of buzz words and pep talks but little action when it comes to taking care of employee concerns.
good,Sales is rough with little to no reward for extremely demanding tasks and goals but other than that it is good. Sadly your hours are determined by how well you sell so if you dont do well then you lose your hours. Discount is on very few nicer items but you will be surprised and love it once you find that one special item.
good,Please ask about my experience. I had a lot of positives and negatives in this job and would want to disparage a company who did well by me.
good,"Best buy is a great stepping stone, but should never be treated as a career."
good,it was a fun time. i enjoyed the material i worked with and the people i interacted with both employees and customers.
good,"Great if you're career retail. Very difficult to maintain work/life balance with schedule changing every week. Some stores are better than others to work at. If leadership doesn't care it's not a great place to work, but I've worked at stores that are great and it feels like a big family."
good,Overall I would say Best Buy has added in great leadership and is headed in a positive direction.
good,"This is a good entry level job. Not a terrible place to work, but it wears pretty thin pretty quickly."
good,Typical day at Best Buy: waiting on customers that come in your line with a smile each and every time. I learned how to be efficient with each customer and handling money. I loved working with the other emploees. The hardest thing with this company was on Black Friday and the amount of customers you had to wait on in a timely manner.
good,"In this case I don't remember much of my experience, I was in the warehouse and did loading and unloading of trucks as well as some logistics work.  I probably could have gone further with this company but hey everything happens for a reason."
good,"Fun, fast-paced, and great clientele. Worked with a really great team for an equally great company"
good,"Make sure you know your stuff about the product around you, especially the section that they designate you in.  If you want them to hire you permanently, you're going to have to do outside research on the product in order to be good salesman at Best Buy and to show you are reliable and consistent at sales."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Best Buy Mobile is that when a customer comes in and really is looking for a better service provider or product, we were able to help most of the time because we had almost everything under one roof. We were able to give REAL options instead of one sided comparable one's."
good,Mostly a good place to work with a fun team and the freedom to be out of the store that comes with being an installer. Local management rarely understood my job and responsibilities so they were no help when issues came up. District leadership was good but too far away to be effective for immediate issues.
good,its an overall great company with good pay. loved working with alot of amazing people.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Daily jobs in client’s homes and commercial settings include: Installation of low-voltage wiring, programming custom"
good,"Long days with sales, numbers mean everything. Good co-workers."
good,"best place to work, great enviornment and people there good too"
good,Great people....not that great pay or even ways to move up.  I worked there for entirely too long and no one came to me to show me how to move up or even give me a chance...I went to the boss and he literally told me that he knew you couldn't live on this pay.
good,"Great way to meet new people."
good,The biggest thing I learned from working at Geek Squad was how to teach people about technology or how to explain things in its simplest terms.
good,Sell electronics and accessories to meet customers needs while being encouraged by good supervisors and managers
good,"talking to customers"
good,"It's been a long time since I worked there, but what I can remember is high daily goals for your sales; they would track that."
good,I enjoyed working for Best Buy.  It had great benefits and pay
good,got to play with gadgets all day. learned about pretty much everything in the store
good,"•	Currently meeting all sales’ goals set by management"
good,"Like any retail job and with any job, working for this company has its pros and cons.  Management for the region maintained a 'boys club' personality and they promoted people based on seniority instead of who was best suited for the job.  I did learn quite a bit about technology and I have translated that into a successful position with the Geek Squad.  Co-workers also had various cliques and it was difficult to work with them at some times.  I big plus was the work/life balance that was provided to me as I had several options for time off and was able to get assistance for life events."
good,"Asset protection associate"
good,"A typical job, working for a large corporation. Fun while it lasted"
good,"• Interacted in a fast-paced environment to assist customers in product knowledge to fulfill the specific needs that pertained to the customer. "
good,"Overall Best Buy is a good place to work for at least my store was for awhile. The people you meet are intelligent and will work FOR the customer. Management lacks connection to its staff and most of the upper managers didn't know how to the use the basic systems that we worked with everyday. They were disconnected from their staff and only looked at numbers. Overall the shifts aren't bad and the work is fun, but the environment breaks down overtime."
good,"a typical work day insisted of contacting customers through out the day, working through hard sale, learning new technology, also down stocking through the day to make sure the sales floor looks presentable."
good,Best buy is a pretty good place to work an entry level job.  I enjoy most the diverse range of co-workers.
good,"Best Buy was a temporary job until the big one. The Navy."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,a fun place to work but only if you enjoy a fast paced challenging environment when it comes to sales
good,it is ok job for a high school student high paced great people managers have  their days
good,"565....One team, one dream! A Big family when I worked here. Started to change and was not about being a family so I left."
good,"Fun place to work, people are great. good part time work while in school."
good,"hours vary so much from week to week. Some of the discounts are good but other then that ,the pay is not so great."
good,"Prevented theft from the store and greeted customers."
good,"The job is not too bad, I had issues with them scheduling my work hours and interfering with my school hours. I personally left because of that. Other than that the pay is competitive and the average work day can vary. Some days were stressful I had long lines and not enough help at my best buy store as of recent when I go to visit things have seemed like they have changed for the better."
good,"Connecting customers with the best solutions to their technological needs and providing continuing support for the life of their products is business as usual. Friendly and fun atmosphere for customers as well as employees, helps keep open minds for a  great learning environment. Overcoming customer complaints and confusion is an every day occurrence, which can be some of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences in a customer service based field."
good,"Working in customer service at Best Buy was great. Although for the position i had acquired, i had not been properly trained for. Yes, i work well on my feet, but for the first two weeks i was trained for transactions. Transactions are only 10% of my job duties and a multi-channel sales associate, so i felt that i didn't have the tools i need to perform the job as well as i could have in the beginning."
good,I moved from working as a computer technician to the warehouse to better accommodate my college schedule.  The work wasn't bad but I doubt hourly retail would pay enough to support a household
good,it is easy for the company to work around your schedule. management always acknowledges sales associates that make big sales.the hardest part of the job is also the funnest which is pushing consumer sales
good,"It was an okay place to work. Like any other place it's all in what you make it..so you have to go in with that mindset. A decent job for people in their late teens,early 20's people beyond that age group seem to have a hard time adjusting. Pretty good health benefits--especially, Vision Insurance.. Management was sometimes clueless. Other than that it was one of the best jobs I've had."
good,Learn something new everyday. Provide personalized service and exceptional level of expertise for customers.
good,Working as a consultation agent you are learning new things everyday by working side by side with clients solving computer issues.
good,Co-Workers were always great to work with. I worked at the Old Orchard store. I loved it. Sadly this location is no longer open.
good,Similar to other retail jobs. great coworkers. company improved a lot.
good,The work an job was great the management of the job site train me great
good,Great company while I was there. They could change direction quickly. Problem was they lost their way with Customer Centricity.
good,Great place to work but job security shaky and the hours sucked.
good,"Great place to work when you look at the people you work with and how much fun and experience you gain, however it is still retail and it slowly kills your soul."
good,Typical big box life.  Varried schedule with terrible hours.  Especially holiday hours.
good,They don`t consider any employees opinions on improving departments and have never given full praise or appreciation of security workers or non-sales people.
good,"Responsible for frontline phone support quick analysis answering basic PC, Tablet & Software."
good,I worked for best buy while in college and it was a wonderful experience.
good,a great place and company to work for. learned a lot of new things about the compaany
good,"	Responsible for pre-wiring, installing, programming, and maintenance of products and services ordered for structures"
good,"Working at Best Buy is not a bad job. They pay is better than at most places and the discount is great. However, the company can't seem to decide on a business model. A company has to change and adapt to grow but at Best Buy the changes are much too frequent."
good,Good for college students or someone who needs a part time job
good,"great place to work, easy to work at, nice outgoing co-workers."
good,This is your typical retail job. Convince people to buy stuff they don't really need.
good,Not alot of moving around but fun work place to work in. can be promoted easily if working hard
good,great company to work for but unfortunately barely any room for improvement
good,Employers are great when there is an open communication and they work side by side with you on projects.  Taking care of customers always first.
good,I had a fair experience withe the company and it's employees. I learned about the overall process of the company
good,They don't really train you all that well for any of the jobs.
good,My favorite BestBuy value is: Have fun while being the best! The culture created in the store defines the success of the day. The team enjoy providing the right solution for customers. The leadership team work cohesively to achieve daily sales and operational goals. My multi-tasking skills increased as a leader working at BestBuy. Multi-unit retail requires cross training to ensure an outstanding customer service experience. I
good,You help customers all day and tell them about all the tech in the store. They make sure they give you all the tools you need to do the job
good,"Company isn't looking to promote anyone from inside the company no matter what successes you have had or are having. It seems that you can make it to the assistant manager level but after that they only hire general managers from outside the company. All they talk about is work life balance but they don't practice what they preach, long hours and not much awards or recognition. They give you these points that you can redeem on a company website but then 50% of the points you redeem are taken out of your paycheck monetarily. So whats the reward??? Also I received my ten year reward 2 months after my 12 year anniversary date (which was a plastic cup), thanks but the CEO could have kept it for paper weight. Pay system is terrible, managers are extremely underpaid for the amount of hours you put in and its even worse below that. Competitors are paying line level employees 3 to 5 dollars an hour more."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"How to sell products. Management was very vivacious. Exciting, fast paced environment. Got along great with co-workers. Hardest part when lines were long. Enjoyable part increasing company sales."
good,Best Buy is a normal retail establishment. There are enjoyable days and people as well as the ones that you have to just exert your best professional ability with. The hardest part of working at a retail establishment such as this is the hard to deal with co-workers or customers.  The most enjoyable part is the friendly and nice co-workers and customers. Helping the customers and making them very happy with you and satisfied with the results of your help would definitely be the best part of retail work.
good,"lots of customer interactions, sales driven store, decent hourly pay, fun coworkers and managers, fair management"
good,"This was just a way for me to earn some money before going to college. Once I was accepted, the management refused to work around my new scheduling restraints. Other than that, the other team members were friendly and helped each other out anytime they needed it."
good,Best Buy is a great company.  If learning the ins and outs of customer service is on your agenda this is the place for you.
good,"The company is your average retail store, staff more educated than managers in many circumstances."
good,"Repair electronics with minimal tools and equipment "
good,"Manage the repair, installation, and service of computer and consumer electronics products using online portal and remote software."
good,Working in the sales environment is fun with the team.  It is enjoyable talking to people and finding solutions for their needs.
good,"A typical work day is setting up new merchandise to corporate standards, I work very independently which is ok most of the time.  There are times where I wish there were someone else to assist with some of the larger item displays. (Such as Big Screen TV's).  I enjoy setting up the merchandise and the feeling of accomplishment once I see the finished product.  Because I work so independently, Management is not always around to assist if a problem arises.  I work with fun people and enjoy interacting with customers as they are shopping.  "
good,"Not fun. Decent co-workers, low pay, treated like commission with no commission."
good,"Meetings"
good,"It was fun when I first started,and I made good money.I also won 4 trips that were paid for.They cut all of that out,and it became a lot less fun"
good,great job with fun co-workers. I am just not made for retail. fun job if you enjoy selling.
good,"A typical day at work was to make sure that there was customer and employee safety, theft deterrence and great customer service."
good,Working at best buy was comprised of helping customers and doing work at the store.
good,"Best buy is a really nice place to work, I always enjoyed my time working there!"
good,A typical day would be talking to customers about problems they have with their laptop.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a very busy store, especially the mobile department. A typical day consists of seeing various faces and fast paces. Its very important to maintain updated knowledge the products, plans and service features and PRICES of every carrier. The hardest part of the job can be the self learning portion. Most people dont take initiative to  learn updated information such as plan changes, device prices, etc, and tend to lack knowledge. This can result in negative feedback or upset customers."
good,"• Assisted in customer retention goals by mentoring and developing Best Buy Mobile employees • Coordinated relationships with customers and employees in the store to create and maintain a team-based, cooperative work environment • Educated customers on various cellular products to better their experience with the company."
good,Assessed customers needs then provided them with the necessary products
good,If it weren't for the discounts i wouldve quit a long time ago.
good,"A typical day at customer service was usually smooth with minor issues. I learned how to keep myself calm and how to defuse situations whenever they occurred. Management was good. I liked my co-workers, we always helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was turning away customers if their product was out of the return policy or out of the warranty policy. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers walk away happy and satisfied with their service."
good,A fun place to work where you encounter all types of customers and situations.  Management gave great incentives to make you strive to be a better employee.
good,I learned how to sell computers and how to manage customers effectively.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work! I enjoyed my time working for the company. There were daily staff meetings and team building games. Very team oriented place to work!
good,"I would typically interact with customers who had questions regarding computers and service options provided by best buy. However, slow days and bad attitudes were a negative in my department."
good,was very informing and taught me a lot about the sales world.
good,At bestbuy everyday is about sales. We would satisfy customer need with best customer services. We make sure that customer has  all items that qualify with there device that have purchased.At Best Buy i learned how to  communicate with others.I learned how to sell items through a system that we call E-learnings.This system made me more confidant.My managements and co-workers are friendly and very helpful. My hardest part of my job is not meeting the sell. When this happens you have to work extremely hard to get that sell.The most enjoyable part is having fun while being the best.
good,"Busy for the most part."
good,The company goes through many changes. The people are great.  The managament is great.  The only real negative is opportunity for advancement. Working with all kinds of customers and co-workers is fun and crazy all at the same time.  I just wish there were more opportunities because this is a great organization.
good,Product knowledge expanded while working at Best Buy. I learned a lot about technology. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers which wasn't that hard for me.
good,no career advancement available and the management is not really helpful with helping you advance either. Fellow colleagues are amazing to work with.
good,A typical day at work is exciting. the hardest part is cleaning up but with good co workers it goes by quickly.
good,A typical day of work started early unloading trucks before opening and then helping customers and associates throughout the day.  I learned how to coach and train a great team of people and to overcome multiple obstacles.  Our management team was a cohesive unit that drove business results and showed great compassion for our team.  The employees were like family.  They were a great group with unlimited drive and potential.  The hardest part of the job was taking on more responsibilities without being compensated with pay increases.  It did not take long to meet your pay cap.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting some of the nice people that came into the store and training some great people that became like family.
good,A great business that is being dragged under by the online market and is still adapting.
good,"I had a great time there for 9 years, company needs to do better in terms with health benefits,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I wasnt there long enought o give a true review. The customers were nice enough
good,"Management was very numbers driven instead of interacting and overseeing the employees to help drive sales by providing knowledgeable customer service.  Also, many people were not held accountable to any jobs or tasks outside of selling in my particular department.  Bonuses were tied to performance that spanned multiple departments instead of a specific department, which made it more unattainable to meet goals."
good,don't work their anymore. I can't really say how it is anymore and when i was their i was young and didn't really take my job serious bc i was a kid in high school.
good,Best Buy is a great place to get your feet wet. There are many opportunities to grow and advance. If you have an area of interest there are opportunities to learn more about those areas and roles. Any customer facing position can be fantastic but challenging at times. Knowing how to find a healthy balance is key.
good,"My typical work day at Best Buy included cashiering, customer service, and sales. I enjoyed this job because it was an fun environment with always something new to learn about. I enjoyed my managers and my co-workers was a great work environment."
good,good company to work for the job isn't that demanding and you leave whenever the job is done
good,"• A typical day consist of assisting customer with the purchase of product, as well as explaining the product in great detail. "
good,Customers can make or break your day. Either way you still have computers to work on in the back. People you work with are awesome.
good,"Nice place to work, friendly environment, shifts go by fast,"
good,"An Ok workplace. "
good,"Engage customers using selling skills to build complex, connected solutions in a fast-paced, dynamic environment where customers feel supported and leave delighted."
good,Fun place to work!! Expect working weekends and holidays. The pay is average. Must like technology.
good,Helping customer for the most part. Unfortunately Best Buy doesnt have much of a training program. Luckily I have had several years with other companies and school that I learned most of what I needed to help customers find the correct item they needed. It was always nice to have customers ask for me personally for they knew I would not try and over sell them things they did not need. Co-Workers where easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was sometimes dealing with managers that wanted me to see things that where truly no benefit to the customer but cost more. Most enjoyable would be dealing with customers even if they were difficult to start with they usually saw that I was more on their side when it came to getting them the correct item for them not just the most expensive one.
good,give product knowledge. assist with troubleshooting. sale solutions
good,"Best Buy offers a great way to stay updated with current technology. The job also offers good use for networking. However, there are small hours and small benefits."
good,"The team I am currently on is heavily based on merchandising. I display products, such as TVs, camera, appliances, etc. I also set planograms, which are set maps on how the store is to be presented, like product and signage. I make sure the store is clean and bright, and price tags are current. Management is fairly laid back as long as you are doing what is expected of you. The most challenging part of this job is that I work alone. I'm given a set workload and it must be completed within the time frame given, so time management skills are a must. The most enjoyable part of the job is the balance of independence and still being a team player, as I have my own store to take care of, but also go to other stores in the area to help out when my help is needed."
good,"A typical day at work you of course had to deal with different types of consumers who were needing help find a product or wanting to build an entire home theater system. I learned a lot about technology as well as installation of multiple different styles of home theater rooms. The management in the company is very erratic. It is because the company doesn't know the right path to take to succeed right now. The hardest part of the job was simply income. Making barely minimum wage is difficult when you're making the company hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly. I did enjoy helping customers build that ultimate solution, if that was a computer or a home theater or a car setup. It was always fun building big toys."
good,"Best Buy sales great product but is very poor at communicating clear expectations. During the interview process I accepted this position with the understanding of working only one weekend a month, two during peak seasons (holiday, Back to school , ect.) and once I signed the new hire paper work, not only did I work every weekend, I closed every weekend night. Horrible lack of respect for everyone's personal time."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The typical day is helping customers at the desk with their the computer problems. I was able to learn a lot of information pertaining to customer service and interfacing. The management was okay a Best Buy. There are several managers so it depended on who was working for how your experience would be. There really wasn't much that was difficult with working at a Best Buy. The most enjoyable part of working there was the people I worked with. I still am in contact with a good number of them. They are great people.
good,i like working as a team and accomplishing goels when the job is getting done the thrill and feeling and pay day every one likes pay day
good,I would clock on and start fixing computers. I would work on computers most all of the shift which I loved
good,"Working at Best Buy can be a really great experience at the line level. You have really great job security until you hit management. Once there all bets are off, as the company is doing its best to stay afloat in this digital era. I've seen some of the most loyal people lose their jobs because their job was replaced with a lower paying job and they were forced to compete with up to 15 other people for a single position. People who have put 10+ years into the company let go, some being told over the phone instead of face to face. "
good,Was an ok place to work. The only reason i work there was for the discount on electronics.
good,I love going in and having my customer leave happy. I work very hard to make sure they get the best experience. My co workers are fun to work with and we all count on eachother.
good,"good company if its your first time working. you bonus every month. co workers work with with and management is pretty friendly but like all goal oriented jobs you get a bit of pressure to mean budget goals, but that should be normal"
good,The hours are inconsistent and there is not much room for advancement.  The work environment is very fun.
good,"You are expected to meet and greet with every customer possible. Maintain a sanitary work environment by cleaning tablets, computers, and phones. Must have accurate knowledge of promotions, products, BestBuy policy, and how to approach people. I am expected to inform every customer of the benefits of the BestBuy Credit Card and other accessories to help customers by selling solutions. I went into this job with limited knowledge about tablets and smartphones, but over my time in BestBuy I have gained extensive knowledge of our products and services. I have learned how to approach different kinds of customers by learning various methods to learn who they are as people to help them better. The most difficult part of the job is having to hear the word ""no"" a lot. I have become relentless on the sales floor because I am not fearful of the customers' rejections. My co-workers help make me feel like we are a team because we gain bonuses collectively from each other.  We (as co-workers) assist one another to improve our probability of making more money."
good,"Best Buy is an excellent place to work when you are young and single. More and more as the company gets more competitive and tries to cut costs you have to do more with less. This puts salaried leadership in a tough spot deciding between family and the job. It is a mandatory 50 hour work week but you typically put in more like 60 to make things work. You work virtually all holidays and Thanksgiving essentially does not exist anymore if you are a leader for this company. On the flipside most employees are fun people to work with, they have great benefits and above average compensation."
good,Pretty good company to work for. There is not much tech work to do in the stores. The employee benefits are very good.
good,"easy job "
good,Working on the sales floor was extremely stressful at times with all the requests management had for you to perform. They were understaffed at times. I loved working at Geek Squad though.
good,"Working for Best Buy is fun and interesting. I learn something new everyday. Clients visit everyday with technical issues and questions ranging from PC's to different mobile devices. Resolve issues daily dealing with internet connectivity, OS corruption, and viruses. Management is okay but could be better. Co-workers are fun to work with and we learn a lot from each other. The hardest part of the job is running into issues I haven't seen, lacking knowlege regarding client's questions. The most enjoying part is resolving technical issues, helping clients understand better about their devices, and learning new technology."
good,Was an ok place to work. The management at the time was horrible and never was taken serious.
good,"Overall, this job is a great way to help experience with customers and to learn communications.  The different functions with the jobs allow one to learn how to multitask and organize themselves to accomplish the job.  We were as a team in this company."
good,very fast pace and fun and great job bad company to work for they don't care about there employees
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It is a retail job, you wait on customers and take care of them accordingly. The hours are there when the business is and when it is not then they are not."
good,"A typical day at work would be filled with a lot of hard, back bending work. A few laughs here and there. I learned to speak up for myself more and to not allow people to steal my joy. Management at first was very unorganized, but the new supervisor had better control and organizational skills. My co-workers were unbearable at times, only a handful were sincere and decent. The hardest of the job would've been to beat your previous day's production. The most enjoyable would've been break time and working with someone who didn't make you want to pull your hair out."
good,This company is on its way down. Yearly restructures make it almost impossible to make it a career.
good,"It is a great place to get your roots on the ground with regards to technical work. The experience earned at this position is invaluable and would be of great help in future endeavors. Unfortunately, pay is not as expected, considering the amount of mind work that goes into the job. On top of that, work hours are severely depleted in light of recent events with the company. With that, unless you move higher up in the ranks, this is not something to make a career out of."
good,"The people you work with are fun and easy to get a long with...You are judged on how well you attach to your sales and raises, if you can call them that, are minimal. The leadership team is not always on point when it comes to your availability. If you are wanting to move up in the company you should probably look else where."
good,There is room for advancement but it usually includes moving to another store. Hardest part of the job is working holidays. Varying schedule. Hours reduced in summer.
good,"Lead management team to execute company plan."
good,It was a fun job but working for the buy more is no bueno. Angry people everywhere.
good,Typical days at best buy involve interacting with customers demonstrating some of the coolest tech available. With the constantly evolving technology industry its always cool to be on the front lines of whats hot and whats not. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is staying ahead of the tech curve with ever changing software as well as hardware. The most enjoyable part of this job would definitely have to be the interactive workplace where u get to see first hand all the new technology.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me assisting customers in their needs and getting to play with the latest electronics!"
good,"Meeting customer service needs and wants, Meeting sales goals"
good,"Great place to start your career"
good,Typical day would consist of working on computer software/hardware all day.
good,"Sales lead for 3 years, leaving to get a start in a career in my field of study"
good,"Best Buy is a very exciting job, especially if you are into sales. The managers and supervisors will give you a hard time, which is part of their job. They train you and they have good benefits as well, only if you are full-time."
good,"Its not a bad place to work, but I am looking for a more hands on job that I can apprehend if need to be."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"In my experience, managers do not support advancement of part-time or full-time sales consultants. Managers fear for their job constantly, putting the stress on their sales consultants to perform instead of taking responsibility. Coworkers have always been great, and the environment is fun."
good,opening consisted of attending the daily meeting about how much the store was down and what needed focus and then turning the lights on and the equipment on. Dealing with the customer's was often enjoyable.
good,"No set schedule in any way. Very fluctuating schedule so you must be able to adapt to a very fast paced sales driven environment. I have had a lot of good takeaways from the company though such as, P&L research, understanding consumer trends, and leading through example. One major downfall is the sales expectations and goals are unrealistic and barely attainable. Feels like a commission based environment but not paid commission. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of watching cameras, customers and coworkers and make sure that nothing goes wrong. I check receipts and greet customers. I learned how to be patient because you need patience to  work in retail. the hrdest part of this job is standing in one spot all day. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to nice customers"
good,"Best buy is a corporation in which many people have either good turn outs or bad ones, its all what the individual does with their time there."
good,"People are great, systems are top-notch, environment and building are wonderful, leadership is prone to shake-ups, many head-scratching policy decisions, unstable marketplace/industry"
good,"I loved this job and would have stayed, but I have very personal issues regarding my area manager and could not stay long. If not for him, I could have been there for years to come."
good,This Position was very rewarding because of its great health benefits
good,"Sold mobile phones, coworkers were really fun but sometimes customers were rude."
good,i loved my coworker at best buy hated the GM luckly she got fired for cheating on store reviews
good,Analyze Sales data determine how to increase sales. Train employees on specific products and sales techniques as well as on how to increase margin and profitability. The most difficult part of the position was managing four departments. the most enjoyable part was to build relationships with customers.
good,"good company overall, great products and good environment, there were some moments were management was not very efficient"
good,"All right people, learned diversity. Stale at times, effect wears off fast."
good,Don't need to reviedon't need to review this either................W this either................
good,Fun workplace but the company is undergoing dramatic changes
good,"Although I have had a great time working for this company, I have learned that the work environment can differ from store to store."
good,"You meet great people and stay up to date with technology. Sometimes management can be tough, but just keep your head in the game and make sure you make nice with people you work with. Some of my very best friends started out as my coworkers."
good,"My job consisted of answering phones, processing transactions, and helping customers with anything they might need."
good,I liked the job but there were no hours so there was no money to pay the bills. Now our Supervisor Adam was a good boss. Install bay was different from rest of store. We had our stuff together in the bay.We could never get hours at part-time.
good,"I learned how to scan items, what the labels mean that goes on the boxes of the items. A typical day would be scanning items off the pallets, boxing and shipping them to customers or stores. The hardest part of the job was standing on concrete floors. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning and interacting with other employees trying to reach our count goal."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I have worked for them for over a year. While the environment can be fun, its lacking on certain things. The pay rate has not changed for me and management isn't stream lined. This would be a good first job for a highschool student not for a single mom trying to make it."
good,"Too much work, too much ""flexibility"" in work hours and, NOWHERE near enough pay for the P E O P L E you will have to deal with.\"
good,Working at Best Buy was a fun environment and was a great experience
good,"It's an okay place to work, you meet lots of people while working here and the managers are nice. The co-workers are really great people to work with and I've worked two Holiday seasons for them and each time it's great."
good,"If you can sell, and have a positive attitude, then best buy will teach you how to get out there and make them money.  When I was with them, the culture still was in a buying frenzy and everyone was approved for credit.  As such, management expected that every customer walked out with $100 in product, $500 in accessories, and $1000 in service plans...every time.  If you can do this, then you have a future, if not...then they will put you in the back corner until you go."
good,The job was fun and entertaining. I loved the interaction with my co-workers and the customers.
good,"I was responsable for the hiring and training of new associates, posting new job openings both internally and externally, pre-screening potential hires, teaching new hire classes, coaching and guiding new hires through the first 90 days of hire, and ordering uniforms, name tags, and supplies for new hires."
good,"a typical day at work was very fast busy,always busy. I learned alot about Administrative and Human resources working for Best Buy for 10 years.Working there is where i picked up alot of my office skills and the ability to be a good Admin assistant. The management at Best Buy were pretty fair and were always available to you..If there was a problem or an issue that needed attention they would make that a priority and resolve the issue so that it was a good environmeny ot work in.The hardest part of the job i would say was when i did payroll and the employees who took time off or needed to be paid for sick time or vacation time,never turned in there time it would hold up the process and that wasnt fair to all the employees who did their time clock right.I really enjoyed working there in general i like the people i like the job i had and i like the fact that everyone got along so it was overall an awesome environment to  be in."
good,"Good company getting better little by little. they still have their problems, but their working on them. at least where i worked they gave scarce hours especially if they had given you a lot before so the can be what seems greedy."
good,"Management just wanted us to make them look good. Those that could sale, like me, were complimented and praised. Those that couldn't were treated horribly. I did get to learn a lot and grow as a person. I enjoyed helping customers and giving them the best experience possible."
good,I worked for BB in New Hampshire and really enjoyed my time working there. I was challenged to maintain order in many cases which I enjoyed. I found the entire operation a joy to work for. I moved to another state and found that the pay was far less than I had been making. I was very let down by the disparaging pay difference.
good,Really good job if you like helping people. Enjoyed the environment and the discounts.
good,Did the best of my ability to help customers with any issues they had.
good,Best Buy mobile gave me my first take of leadership in the workplace.  I was responsible for challenging my team members to hit goals while keeping a positive attitude and world class customer service.
good,Best was ok management was very bad. there was no trust there at all. over all job was good and u did have a chance to advance up
good,"Engage customers using selling skills to build complex, connected solutions in a fast-paced, dynamic environment where customers feel supported and leave delighted. "
good,"cashiering"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Opportunities to grow a career in a company that struggles to grow marketshare in a tough economy and a serious competitive marketplace both brick & mortar as well as on line retailers is challanging. Focus on the customer is world class. Strong company mission and values driven organization made Best Buy a good fit however, constantly changing turnover in executive leadership, reduced workforce and 4 reorganizations in 5 years create all too much uncertainty for the future."
good,"get to learn all the new and latest technology; TVs, iPods, iPads, tablets, computers, laptops, gps, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working here. On normal days, it was normally slow. I was required to get branded payments and geek squad protection. I really was ok with my job responsibilities, I just wasn't acquiring enough hours. It was just time for a change."
good,Fun and great retail environment. Best Buy provides superior training for each employee.
good,fun work place to be apart of. the people working there are great and the perks that comes with the job is great
good,"I was required to sale credit apps to customers, as well as informing them to sign up for reward points which helped them regain money spent. I also learned how to work a cash register, persuade customers into buying a certain product. The hardest part of the job was making sure that every transaction was correct and done in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part was being around my co-workers knowing that they're willing to help if I have any problems."
good,very hard to move up. been with store for 4+ years and had little to show for it.
good,"•	Supported, coached and developed supervisors and associates, creating an environment where associates could be successful.  "

good,Typical day at work receive drop shipment left over from morning shift load and store stock and fulfill  online orders for the store
good,Typical day was quick and easy i was a volunteer so i didn't have much time or experience to say much about the job. I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to boosting my skills with other companies.
good,"Fun work environment, If you enjoy the retail hours! You get the opportunity to sell people electronic toys and fun things they want and some times need."

good,"Retail is awful, but I guess if you're going to do it Best Buy is where you'd want to do it."
good,Fun work environment. Always different problems to solve for clients. Co workers usually consisted of some type of nerd so you got to learn a lot of new things that were fun to hear about. Not knowing when I could advance into a full-time or into management was hard to accept. I really liked the satisfaction from helping people with their computers.
good,Minimal pay and a bad work/life balance. The company expects you to bend over backwards to close sales but they are rarely ever willing to help you balance your life with your job as far as a schedule goes. Moving forward in the company comes down to being a suck up or being buddies with the person that has the power to promote you.
good,best buy is a great co to work for. Lots of perks and the enrgy is always high. Pressure to sell but otherwise fun and stimulating experience.
good,I was making calls to customers who purchased appliances at their local best buy store. My coworkers were laid back and fun to hang with.
good,"If you're looking for dull repair work, with expectations increasing much faster than your pay, look no further. Geek Squad has single-handedly destroyed my interest in computers. Due to, what I would consider, shady business practices and ridiculous goals I have bid a fond ado to this company forever. If you needed some quick ""temporary"" work this may work for you, but I wouldn't suggested trying to make a real career out of it."
good,not a horrible place to work for. Just have a lot of work load for minimal pay compared to other places in the same field.
good,Very easy to move up the ladder at Best Buy. You can also earn product certifications during downtime that help out a lot!
good,Because I am still currently involved with the company I am not authorized to give my most honest review. I am however authorized to say that not all stores operate the same.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers, teaching them how to operate their computers, radios, tvs,dvd players, etc..."
good,Check it out for yourself and form your own opinions.Best Buy works for some and not for others.

good,Good part time job wile attending school. Great sales experence
good,"great place to get customer service experience and pay, can sometimes can be hard work,"
good,"Good place to work if you dont mind working in sales. It is retail so when everybody else has the day off most likely you'll be working, that includes holidays. Unless you are ""in the loop"" with management it can be quite difficult to move up in the company but it is possible as long as you're a great worker. Some perks include the employee discount, which is the best in the industry, and bunch of free stuff like tablets, movies, etc, from vendors."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The best thing about working in the Geek Squad for Best Buy is that you have the opportunity to stay on top of the new technology of computers and tables that come out. I have learned much from Best Buy, for example; price negotiation, great communication skills, and advance technology. "
good,"Typical retail duties, light physical work. Sales driven and goal oriented atmosphere, Fun and lay back"
good,main focus was customer service. Overall good job. Co-Workers were overall good and easy to work with.
good,Weak managerial staff at the time created an unpleasant working environment. Great discount.
good,A very fast past work environment. Things change very quickly - need to be able to adapt to all kinds of change.
good,But in reality they pay little and expect too much. They ask for your opinion but when you give it to they...and they don't like what they hear they take it out on you.
good,refuse to pay employees more than 9-10$ an hour. retail experience all the same
good,Best Buy is a wonderful company and treat their employees very well.
good,Provide sales and support on all consumer electronics. Achieve established monthly sales goals in all areas
good,"Working in the home theater department at Best Buy was fun.  I would get to talk about the newest TV technology and audio visual components that go with them.  I mainly would just come in and talk to customers about the product we had.  If there was a person interested in a tv I would give them different options between LCD, Plasma, and rear projection.  I would offer bluray/did players along with home theater surround sound equipment.  The management staff there was very good.  They helped you whenever you needed it, and trained you if you had to get trained.  The hardest part was selling the add ons.  Trying to sell a dvd player, surround sound, the cabling for them, and an extended warranty was tough.  The most enjoyable part would have to be the great discount."
good,I learned a lot on loss prevention and what to look for with different type of shoppers
good,it was fun to work at but very little supervision and pay wasn't great
good,"When working in this particular company, I have found that I have become more confident especially in approaching people who I do not know. It has made it easier to create a business relationship with these customers, resulting in them coming to the store for future purchases. "
good,handle every day with customers please them with theirs needs of taking care of their products they buy.
good,"Highly matrixed environment."
good,"The job is very simple and does not change much from day to day which makes for a very boring time.  The job does not require much skill and I feel that I am overqualified to still be working there.  "
good,"The structure balances sales and performance, with opportunities made available due to what suited you best."
good,"High volume sales floor where you have to think fast and be extremely well informed about the product lines. Loads of responsibility. Fun job if you like a fast pace and are a people person."
good,"Learned about the patience needed when working in customer service, and the value of the dollar."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,i enjoyed my day at work. it was quite alright. customer service was really great and i had a lot of good reviews and feedback from customers. on the other hand the management and supervisors sometimes didn't know how to talk to associates
good,"The hardest part about this job is that it's incredibly sales driven. For those that are more about doing tasks, its not really the job for you."
good,Ive learned to deal with people and in a clam and nice environment
good,"It was fine working for Best Buy, but not great. My coworkers were not knowledgeable enough about the products they were selling."
good,"Was a fun place to work! Kept busy and made a lot clients happy. It was a physically demanding job, but the pay off was worth it! Clients would be very satisfied with the work I did once I left there homes."
good,It was an ok experience overall. A great place for teenagers to work.
good,"I came in early and stayed late."
good,Interacting with customers to educate them about the changing technology and sell them computers; I learned about new technology. Management was very helpful with tips on how to sell. Coworkers were helpful. Hardest part was closing the sale. Most enjoyable part was knowing that a customer had purchased the right product for their needs.
good,"50% of my day is coaching sales excellence, 30% is sales leading, where I cover the entire store making sure that all customers are being assisted and that all employees are executing proper selling behaviors in accordance with Best Buy's business plan.  20% is following up with employee poor performance and proper documentation and filing paper work.  I have learned what it means to put the customer first 100%, and that with a strong team and good moral, making the customer's shopping experience is dramatically improved.  In addition, the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the excitement on customer's faces as they are wow'ed by the products they worked hard to buy, and by seeing employees properly engaging customers with enthusiasm and energy."
good,"The people made the job, in the end it just seemed like a sales job and not a technical position at all."
good,I was responsible for providing customer service and coaching/ training staff. I was responsible for admin paperwork along with schedules. I got along great with all of my staff along with management.
good,This company is very demanding but has a very great management program. If you have ever wanted to be in the retail world and want to be the best of the best work for this company.
good,"- Flexible hours."
good,"A typical day consists of standing at a register all day and ring people up. I learned how to keep calm under stressful situations due to poor management. The hardest part of the job is to impress management in order for them to give you fair hours. However, the best part are my co-workers. They are all friendly and help out whenever you need it."
good,"It is definitely enjoyable to work with so many different people on a daily basis, and help them find the right solution for their specific needs to make their lives easier.  While working here I learned excellent people skills which I can apply to everyday life.  I also gained a lot of knowledge on technology, how it works, and the many different ways it can be used in conjunction with other products.  Since most everything now has to do with technology, it is to my advantage having worked at Best Buy and learning everything I could."
good,"The work was fairly easy and straight forward with a lot of room for mistakes and learning. There could be times were management was a bit to uptight or overwhelmingly demanding (I mean its retail people) My coworkers weren't too bad, but there was often a sense of division or clique-esk behaviour among the departments through out the store. All and all not a bad job for a high schooler. "
good,Answer questions about various products and services. Not commissioned based.

good,Best Buy is a good place to work part time or as a first job but probably not so much for a career choice. 
good,Never really felt like a part of the team but the discount was pretty sweet.
good,Its ok really but when it come to team work that doesnt really make a difference.

good,"sold to customers did daily deposits, helped answer any customer issues was in charge of 8 employees"

good,Great people to work for and well educated. Fast paced atmosphere.

Many different people at this company with many different attitudes. hardest part was staying there knowing that they would promote who they wanted and there was no structure as to how and why? Most enjoyable part was the Fridays after thanksgiving."
good,"I was very happy with work conditions (plenty of room for computers, well lit, etc). Much of the training was done online witch made for a much quicker and more convenient training experience. Most of my co-workers were easy to talk to and approachable."

good,"A typical day at work included answering phones, training new hires, sorting and completing paperwork, shipping and receiving client product, light computer repairs, and customer facing. The hardest part of the job was convincing people that you are there to help them rather than make money, especially after they had a bad experience once.

good,My work day consisted of helping customers with there computer purchases.  I learned how to become a sales associate and sell merchandise to customers.  The management and staff at this establishment are hard working people that have a good time while working.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with an irate customer when an item that they want is not available.  The best part of the job was the employee's that I worked with.  They were a lot of fun to work and made working more of a game than a task.
good,"Nice job, wonderful company, Just that store in Williamsburg, VA didn't have great management"
good,Many dedicated employees determined to increase product knowledge. Store management under great pressure to produce in tough economic climate. Sometimes there is a disconnect between college age retail employees and more mature store management. 
good,Looking to get in to an area that gives the chance to grow and make this job the next career . 
good,"Best Buy was a great experience for me, it gave me my first job opportunity (outside family). It was very hard to earn advancement of compensation, so much so that high remarks from supervisors and managers, did little to nothing to gain an increase in compensation."
good,"Working at Best Buy has taught me to multitask and that a sales pitch cannot be generalized because it will never work on customers. It must be personalized for ultimate success.  The hardest part of my job was getting customers to purchase Geek Squad protection after waiting in line for extended periods of time when there was little coverage. While it was a difficult task, it was also the most enjoyable as well. "
good,"I not only served as a customer service representative, but I had administrative duties to the store."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy as a company was once a pretty good company to work for. The quality of one's day to day experiences at the company are entirely store dependent, of course. The company's compensation and benefits suffered greatly in 2007-2008. There have been salary caps put in place and this discourages many employees from working as hard as they could. Job advancement was once the goal of many employees and although retention was not terribly high due to the number of college aged student employees, potential for advancement was fostered within the store and that drove greater retention levels than many companies with similar staffing practices. Since several adjustments in salary and benefit offerings in 2008 many of the employees who cared about knowing the products well, learning strong business acumen, and understanding how to drive customer loyalty while also learning and driving business metrics have left for a better work environment with more growth potential. Some might not consider Best Buy to be a career path, yet positive store morale and the business understanding fostered within even part-time employees increased many employees' desire to stay with the company and work to increase their understanding and position in the company. My understanding is this is less frequent than it once was."
good,"good place to work, learned a lot. Large campus with many amenities."
good,"As a sales specialist, customers ask questions about the product and it is the responsibility of the sales specialist to answer questions and sell product to customers. I learned how important relationships are between customers and the people they are buying from. People who feel comfortable talking to you are more eager to listen and make purchases based on recommendations. Co-workers were mostly younger persons inexperienced in the areas they were working. The most difficult part was working with people who care very little about organization they work for, while the most enjoyable part would be selling and talking about products that I shared a great deal of interest in with the prospective buyers."
good,"If you put forth the effort, there is a lot of knowledge to be gained in this environment."
good,"It is a fine job at reasonable pay. It is more-or-less as expected - you talk to customers, identify their needs and sell them products. It's usually fast-paced and busy but it can get slow from time to time."
good,very repetivie work. same thing everyday of the week.
good,Tending to customer needs and putting up stock. Co-workers are a joy to be around.
good,"It was a retail job. Not the best benefits. Good employee discount, though."
good,"Started at the Best Buy in Waco, TX while in school and later transferred to the one in Paramus, NJ. Definitely loved the NJ one better than Texas. My manager in Paramus was amazing. She was an amazing coach. Dealing with customers all day every day can take its toll. She always made sure she encouraged us and always had small incentives for us to keep us motivated. The hardest part of this job was that I was a part time employee while in school so I worked when I was not in school which was most evenings and weekends. I hardly got to enjoy my weekends until I moved to NJ because in Paramus there is a Sunday off law. The most enjoyable part was the fact that I got to interact with so many different people. I learned so much. It is definitely an experience helping people through the process of getting a phone."
good,"I was the inventory supervisor who had a crew of 8 employees. We were responsible for receiving in washers,dryers, electronics,media such as CD's,DVD's,computers, TV's,etc. Had to manage my people so that many tasks could be accomplished,put their schedules together,and report to the department and store manager with numbers and statuses. Hardest part of job was unloading 55 foot trailers and then putting items on floor.Most enjoyable part was walking out at the end of the workday feeling that my crew was capable of accomplishing any task assigned. The guys were that good. WIthout your crew, you mean nothing. We always managed to maintain our standards in the warehouse."
good,cashing people out using customer service.
good,Results oriented work environment
good,"My location was very laid back. Didn't have too much aggravation from other employees. Everyone seemed to work together, no matter their age differences."
good,Very hectic day at work. You never know what your in for. Management can be good but they really get pushed around by corp. Co Workers are great. I love the company and the values. The hours of retail make work life balance very difficult.
good,I like the fact being surrounded by electronics because it's something cool for me.
good,Overall Best Buy is a good place to work. You are valued for your contributions. You also have the ability to move up in the company.
good,Advancement for Best Buy was very political and not based on talent.
good,Great company. Employers really care about the employees. Great benefits.
good,"Good place to work. Lots of room for growth. Long hours. Company is downsizing each year, which causes concerns."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Helped customers on a one on on basis, the most enjoyable part of working at a big company is meeting new people from day to day."
good,• Provided a friendly environment for customers searching for information of products.
good,"A typical day would be just standing up doing nothing, its a good job if you like to not do anything. It just wasn't a good one for me. Management is good, but they have their favorites. Co-workers are stuck up, including the older ones, but some are really nice. Hardest part of the job would probably be advertising their BBY card because people cut you off and you try, but they get irritated."
good,Retail Sales job...what can I say. Low pay and managers want to hit numbers only and don't care about their customers.
good,This company is under new ownership. It was a great place to work under the previous owners.
good,"Great company to work for, but unless you were in with management you woudnt promote very far."
good,best buy customer service was always a piece of cake with the taught knowledge of product and demand. it always felt good to be the solution to customer problems and send them home with smiles. also worked operations as a cashier.
good,A fast paced work environment with frendly employees. Option to learn alot about various electronics.
good,Best Buy used to be a fun place to work. Management can significantly determine the personality of a store.
good,It's a great place to work but it needs to be more considerate of its employees. A typical workday is 8 hours. Rarely get a break if you work customer service. Learning more about profit and losses. Co-workers are like a family and very helpful when needed. Hardest part of the job is the commute for such little pay.
good,Worked great with my school schedule and good opportunities for progression.
good,The people that I worked for where great. The job was a part time warehouse job.
good,I love working and helping customers solve their technical issues. By I need something full time. Also alot of the work is using Geek squad software. Where I would rather a more hands on approach and trying to figure solutions myself instead of just placing usb key and running scans
good,Best Buy is a great job for an outgoing person. That what makes best buy a fun place to work because they hire outgoing people.
good,"It is what is it is. Bad management. Believed in fake, non-existent numbers like upgrade checks. Because that is where the money is. Fake numbers. Never preached hitting revenue just how many upgrade checks can you get."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work but the hours were all over the place and was hard to make plans, there was never a set schedule even when you asked for one. CoWorkers were great people but a lot of them didn't care what they told customers about products because it was just a job to them, they didn't put the time and effort into learning more about the products so that customers could make a well informed decision. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers about technology and how things work and interconnect with each other."
good,"I dont get paid as well as permanent employees, plus i dont receive benefits or bonus so cant really review all that. But the one I work at is fun, and my coworkers and some of my managers are great to work with."
good,"a good place to work when you are young, and between school. if looking for long term, there is plenty for growth in the company."
good,Very fun environment to work in. They were fair to you & weren't terrible at scheduling.
good,"• Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"It was fairly easy, but the workers did not strive to bring customer service like I would have liked. The upper management people were okay, but not very passionate. It is a good job for a student, but that is about it."
good,A day at work is about hitting budget while having fun. I learned how a productive business is run. Management and coworkers are competitive friends who push each other. Hardest part maybe hitting budget everyday. The economy has changed making it a little more difficult to achieve certain levels of success. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with customers.
good,the hours are horrible the manager are usually rude.. pay bettter than other retail locations ssss
good,Sell product as if on commision without being paid commision
good,it was a blast evryday always busy fast paced never a dull momment there loading and unloading trailers is kinda fun doesnt really feal like a job when u enjoy what u do
good,"cashier, customer service, cash handling, sales, greetings, customer service, fun, must be a fast learner, must be able to multitask."
good,A typical day at work during the week are usually slow some days. The weekends get the most busy
good,-Looked at cameras throughout the store for customers stealing or looking suspicious. I once in awhile I took a walk throughout the store during business hours and after.
good,Fun products to play with and show to the customers. All employees are very friendly and happy to help anyone.
good,Process accurate monetary transactions. Offer banking services to every customer.
good,A typical day at work starts at 9 am i will complete the DTL and other jobs described by the manager 10 am the store will open most of the day our department is busy but we all r working as a team and our our management wont give any pressure but they will make sure we al are keeping company policy as it isl .
good,I worked over night as a puller. Pulling products to the sales floor and stocking them on shelfs. Managers were great as well
good,overall best buy is an ideal place to work if you love electronics. Great sales experience required to survive!
good,"It's retail, so sometimes it gets ugly. When there is a chain of command and a chain of communication between everyone, things go smoothly at the ""precinct."" Us agents try to have fun in a hectic environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly helping someone out with a computer problem and being indebted to them. The hardest part of the job is the pay and the management."
good,-you have to sell mainly warranties to show that your good
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Very great place for young people. Very energetic. Had it's up and down days, i would certainly recommend."
good,Best Buy assisted me with my transition from my previous job and I thank them.
good,Overall a great atmosphere if you are looking for a part-time job. Very education in regards to electronic use. Not the best management system. No room for growth with-in the company.
good,"Allowed me the opportunity to learn and grow my management experience, through sales management, operations, logistics and multi-unit management."
good,Was a great company to work for at a young age. Not a job for a career.
good,"this job was easy sometimes and hard many other times, learning new products wasn't so easy"
good,"Every day at this company was a challenge standing behind a counter all day, contacting customers and handling their issues only for management to be against them. When you work in customer service as a representative at a company that sells merchandise that everyone can use, you have to remember you are also a consumer and that customer wants to be treated the same way you expect to be treated if you were on the other side of the counter. The company was driven by numbers and lost focus on the customer which if the energy was directed onto the customer, the numbers will follow in hand. Despite these actions, I always had the customer in mind while also the guidelines of the company. I also saved the company money by changing a return into an exchange while the customers needs are met."
good,good place to work the people are fun and great. good pay and you learn a lot just working there.
good,its not the worst place not the best place to work. turn over rate is high. sup. and man. have power trips at times. the company seems to be doing random things to keep the doors open.
good,"Good job, I liked most of the people I worked with. I hated having to sell magazine subscriptions while checking our customers. It added a completely unnecessary tension while simply trying to get the customer out of the store. lame."
good,"The kids in the Ecommerce department live and breathe their jobs. Burnout seems very high, and salaries are relatively low."
good,"During the start of the day I organized and cleaned my area. I learned how to talk directly to customers to see what product would best fit their needs. The management there was fair, because the store was always very busy you could hardly find one when needed. My coworkers didn't seem to notice me much except for the ones i worked directly with. The hardest part of the job was trying to get customers to sign up for a line of credit with the store. The most enjoying part of working there was the fact that i was surrounded by things im familiar with without having to do research about them, I knew what i was talking about and that gave me more confidence."
good,"Learned a lot about electronics and the differences with TVs. Reminded me of high school with the small cliques, and that made working at that particular store not fun. Company values were good."
good,"Great discount, lots of managers. Great for a part time job.Fun people to work with"
good,"Open up e-mail punch in receive route call cust with appt window perform repairs document everything and go home complete paper work on line and send results, what a job experiance with cust at home and the satisfaction of repairing their appliances, co workers work as a team to help your self and the customers needs, hardest part to balance cust needs and company needs at the same time, most enjoyment is helpng cust with broken equipment and once again the satisfaction of repair"
good,small area to work in. Needs more improvement to the company.
good,Only retail job I have worked and the company is decent although I have no other store to compare it to.
good,"I love the people I work with, but sometimes I don't know what to think about Best Buy as a company. I would suggest waiting to see where the company is headed before working here. I feel like the transitions they are going through just kind of makes it an up-in-the-air place to work."
good,Unbelievable company when I first started.
good,Help people find correct electronics and appliances. Help to return products to the shelf.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.

good,Good place to work. The manager I had was one of the best that I have had.
good,"stocking of shelves, some dock work with pallet jacks, sorting boxes, and high/ lo lift."
good,working the registers and assisting customers on the sales floor. worked here several years ago. Management team at the time wasn't real great to work with but I am sure it is different now.
good,Flexible hours / good people to work with / easy to accomplish tasks
good,iI learned how to pick order. and how to use a reach truck and use a rdt gun to pick oder with. I worked go with others. My job was not that hard.

good,The most enjoyable part of the day is you get to interact with customers on a daily basis. My co-workers are very supportive and knowledgeable.
good,"Fun, good cast of co-workers, evenly distributed work ethic all around."
good,"A typical day at work is a multi-tasking, fast paced environment.Assisting customers and their needs. Excellent team members, good sales training. The management is good, the most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and team members and watching customers leave satisfied. The hardest part of my job is when we are short staffed it makes it more challenging to serve and pertain to every customers needs."
good,This is a good place for a first job or a college student as a part time job.
good,Best Buy have strong cultural standards and close employee interaction as a team. Working for best buy your day starts with greeting the customers and then making sales. During the day products need to be faced and straightened. At the end of the day the Sale Associates section must be completely cleaned up and price tags must be visible. The hours are very inconvenient and leave the worker mo social life unless they are a night person. In the end the mots enjoyable part is making a perfect sale that sends home a happy customer.
good,I love working with friendly and professional indiviauals that are passoniate about working
good,"Best Buy was a great job to start at right out of high school in 2007. A typically day consisted of coming in at 6am and replenishing product for the day such as CD's,DVD's, and Games. I eventually became a sales associate and worked in all of the departments of the store which consisted of Home Theater, Computers, Digital Imaging, and Appliances. I learned how to sell any product in any department. The Management did as good as they could with what they had to work with. The hardest part of my job was when I would work for long hours and my social life would lack but the most enjoyable part was the friends I made in working at Best Buy."
good,I had a good time while working for them however the tech's there don't seem to know as much as they should they are more of a sales team than a group of technicians
good,"Managed the store within the standard operating platform to achieve maximum profitability, while maintaining a positive employee environment, customer satisfaction and loyalty. Responsible for driving total end to end store sales & solutions by enabling and empowering employees. Coached and inspired teams to effectively utilize a full range of solutions, channels, core and growth products to build strategies to solve customer needs. Built and sustained a sales culture where employees clearly understood what was expected to deliver business results. Provided leadership to the entire store staff. – Big Box, Responsible for 200+ people."
good,Learn as you work. Kept up to date on the latest technologies.
good,At NCO Financial their is alot of imbalance and not very much job security very disorganized and people move up based on who they know not what they know (experience and knowledge)
good,"My typical day would consist of meeting every customers need. No customer goes unserved. I love my coworkers, we are truly like a family. The most enjoyable part of my day meeting new people!!"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I worked hard just like I do in any job i believe that as a solutions specialist they put to much on you and don't stress the MCAs work as much which can irritate you.
good,Fun place to work. Learn about all the latest technology. Low pressure environment.
good,lots of energy from basic employees and dept. mgrs. and store mgr. District and Regional staff appear aloof. company throws lots of fish and for most part has a lot of positive energy. Customer service/ computer service can be rude with customers due to being overwhelmed. Hours are brutal on mgmt.. Benefits are good and compensation is good.
good,This was a good job with a good bit of freedom. Mostly consisted of answering phones and dealing with general questions and complaints.
good,"It was a very busy store with very expensive items. At 16 years-old, I was responsible for theft and was scheduled late hours when I was in high school and had school the following morning so had to leave it as a summer job only."
good,"A typical day at work is assuring that our customers get the most efficient, timely and fiendly service posisble to ensure they come back and enjoy their shopping experience. I learned how to be patient and work hard for recognition. My management team are very helpful and kind.. they all have a great sense of humor. The hardest part of my job has to be the rude customers I encounter on a daily basis, but that's apart of being patient. The most enjoyable part is the great people I meet and my discount on most of the cool things in my store!"
good,"As a Geek squad agent, at first it was a great position. However just like anything else best buy destroys what it touches. I worked as a counter agent, Double Agent and Special Agent. I received alot of experience working there, but the pay and the issues of retail wares you out."
good,"I had a great experience working for Best Buy in North Carolina because my coworkers made a terrific team and our managers were beyond excellent. When I moved to CT, the team here was miserable. They weren't trained at all, the manager we had was younger then me and had no idea what he was doing and our store shrink was the worst in the state. They ended up having to cut hours because of loss of product which is mostly because of a poor hiring system and terrible management."
good,"Overall Best Buy is a GREAT company to work for, but the company's reputation can be scarred by the specific store you are employed at. Management can make or break an individual within this company. Salary/wages do not compensate for what an individual puts out or gives up. Benefits are really great with the company."
good,"Best buy was a great job to start off working, you are able to have a flexible schedule to attend school. The management could be a little more supportive."
good,High pace intense sales environment with new challenges in sales and customer service. A results driven environment with goals that are set daily and weekly.
good,It's a great place to work but when the holidays are over it can slow down and be slightly slow.
good,not a liberty to say.This is a good stater company for someone looking to move up in the ranks of a international Retail chain.
good,Started in the morning wasnt bad the managment never really helped you with anything if you needed time off. co-workers great.
good,"A typical day was dealing with returns and exchanges. I was a teenager at this point in my life, I learned to deal with problem solving with personal interactions. The management team was okay. The co-workers did their parts and we worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult issues when it was extremely busy. The most enjoyable part of the day was the personal interactions with different people everyday."
good,• Supervised thirty employees
good,clock in worked sometimes in the day so i would set up for the shipment unloaded merchandise stocked did inventory also learned alot here my co workers were cool the hardest part was when we would unload 2 trucks in timely matter.the most enjoyable was during lunch we would have competions playing video games it was fun and memorable.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"theres a lot of great things about best buy, like the discount, training trips, achievers, vendor accomodations and higher pay than most retail place, but its hard to be comfortable when they change drastically so often."
good,Worked with various people of all types. How to help all walks of life of products. Co-workers were generally understanding.
good,Great place to work at and meet customers. Some managers are somewhat annoying.
good,It worked for my college lifestyle and schedule. A great stepping stone.
good,"My first year was great and I loved my job. The second year went down hill. Management changed and were really rude, the reason why I left."
good,"A typical day includes receiving packages, checking and maintaining our inventory, unloading the product off of trucks, putting it out on the sales floor and carrying out larger items for customers."
good,"Some of the management is not good. There are some managers who truly know what they're doing and make sure it gets done. Though I am not a manager, I feel that I am more determined than some managers, at least one. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of motivation and determination of others, including managers and supervisors. This delays me from getting some of my work done. The best part of the job is being with people who are almost never in a bad mood."
good,I would print out my route for the day and call customers with the times that I would be arriving for their service call. I would check parts and inventory to make sure that what I would need for my customer calls where there. Documentation of all repairs would be made.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. A great company to work for.
good,"Assisting customers over the phone or in person with returns, questions & concerns, sales, product information and any other customer issue that needs to be solved. I have learned how to solve customer issues on my own without direct supervision or guidance from my managers. It is important to be able to make direct decisions on your own in this department. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the customer is satisfied with my effort. This position is not hard although it is demanding at times due to the high volume of customers."
good,A typical day at work for me was always either customer service or inventory overlook. Since BestBuy was my first job I learned how to take inventory in an organized way while also being a great communicator. The managers were strict and gave very short breaks which made working days seem longer and harder then they should be. However;my co-workers had great charismatic personalties which kept the place lively. I would say the hardest part of the job was the managers themselves and the most enjoyable was customers.
good,"Especially in my case, I'm enjoy repairing electronic devices, 95% of my partners were excellent people and we had excellent relationship. Perhaps hardest part for me was to have more equipment ready on the day because I was working with customers devices. Worst of Best Buy is the management, talk every day about policies company, but never respect its. The team leaders, the Service Manager and the General Manager, don't know anything about human relationship also the treatment with the personal is poor and without respect. The workers inside Best Buy service center, can't talk or say anything because need continuous working."
good,"A typical day at work can be anyday. Somedays were bizy working with Clients and other days were quite slow. Clients would come in to service their units that maybe nuder a warrenty either through Best Buy or through the manufacture. Usually anything from laptops to desktops, phones, itouchs etc."
good,"Overall the day is nice customers are very friendly and all the my fellow employies are great to be around but no matter how hard i prove myself to upper management at the store it doesn't matter. They don't me more hours like they said, if i improved my numbers and lie straight to my face saying oh we have to cut employment because we do not enough business coming into the store yet our store and it appears many other bestbuy stores in our district are hitting revenue and meeting the numbers they need to so why lie to the employee. It is getting to the point of disgust."
good,Co-workers make it a great place
good,I am always in a good mood at work no matter how my personal life is. I am great with customers. I love to get them what they need to make them happy. I love working in teams. I don't like to be bored at work. I love fast pace work. And if there is a goal to meet then I will try my hardest to meet that goal.
good,Excellent Management. I had alot going on my last few semesters while working there and I was always free to do.
good,meeting different kind of customers
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering phones, talking with customers regarding product information or inquiries both on the phone and in store. This would be followed by helping with product displays and providing exceptional customer service to customers in store. I learned how to thrive in a customer service/ retail sales enviornment. The hardest part of the job was the rapid fluctuation of hours from one week to the next, Management was ok, There are always good and bad managers in every occupation. The co-workers are all great because everyone is around the same age (18-25) except for the managers and supervisors."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"This was a volunteer/internship program through school, so a typical day for us usually consisted of cleaning the store and restocking product and facing the store so it looked more presentable to customers. I learned different sales techniques while on my internship as well as how to use the best buy inventory system to check how much of a certain product there was at all times."
good,Not a bad place to work there is little to no advancement opportunity in stores. But overall i am happy with my job
good,"best buy is a good company to work for, i work usually 7 hours in the mornings and do cycle counts fro the store. Managment is a little unorganized, lack of communication. most enjoyable part is the people and friends you make"
good,"A typical day at work, if customers were not around, included setting up the departments so that they are completely functional and easy to navigate should customers start to arrive. It was here that I developed much of my sales skills, such as being able to ask the right questions about what customers wanted/expected, their lifestyles, and using that information to make the best recommendation possible. My coworkers were mostly a pleasure to work with, as was the management. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the specifications for products in several different departments. The most enjoyable part was being around people who were very enthusiastic about their jobs."
good,Ok hours
good,"Hours are not given when sales are not made, which is not the employees fault becuase the items are extremely over priced."
good,"It was fun for a college job. However, I would not recommend for a career. The hours are to unstable. I need a job that will allow me to plan events more than a couple weeks in advance."
good,"Your average retail job where you are expected to drive certain metric day in and day out. When holidays come around, the stores are opened much longer which means you won't get out till 11pm-midnight. Compensation is mediocre for the amount of work and stress you put in. It's a retail job so your typical days off are weekdays if you are FT so say goodbye to your weekends! Good place to start if you have no experience whatsoever. You do get all the latest news in the electronic space and you get to see the products before consumers. Employee discounts and vendor accommodations are cool."
good,"I would show up and immediately begin helping the customers with finding any items that the customers are looking for and if its slow i would restock and organize the shelves until my day was over with. unfortunately the management at this particular store was very rude and showed no respect towards many of their employees and also showed favoritism besides the management the co-workers were amazing, professional, and very dependable. I would say the hardest part of the job was the my transportation to and from work in the early mornings and the late nights. Most enjoyable part would be how much interaction with the families who came to buy things for others."
good,A typical day at work consisted of serving customers needs.
good,"While working I suggested new business practice that increased earnings by 20%, assisted customers in finding their unique product needs. Ambassador for Best Buy for Business, which entailed marketing to local businesses and facilitated business transactions. Managed business customers and accounts. Created creative signage to help market particular services and products. I was also known for high levels of engagement with my team members. Conducted weekend meetings and trainings to improve overall team performance as well as create schedules maximize team performance. Worked closely with management to better improve employee health. I was selected for the Future Leaders Program, where select employees get the chance to work with GMs to get an understanding of how to run a company. Considered as very innovative, able to translate customer feedback into new ideas…” (BestBuy Mobile)"
good,"Open store. pass money out. handle customer issues Our growth has created a wealth of career opportunities in our stores and at our corporate headquarters. We offer employees exciting work in a fun, dynamic environment that encourages learning and growth."
good,"Best Buy has always been a fun place to work. Their motto of ""Having fun while being the best"" is a definite description of what the job entails."
good,Geeksquad Repair is different from rest of the Geeksquad. We fix TV's and other appliances in the house.
good,I have learned a lot about understanding the business and how to be an effective leader. I have been fortunate to work under some great managers. The most enjoyable part of my day is always dealing with complex customer issues.
good,This was a basic customer service position. Although it was in retail it did help build my customer service skills when it came to working with all types of people.
good,"I have been with Best Buy on and off for around 10 years, and it was a very good company to work for. The company has changed a little over the years, but I never had any issues outside of pay. I met a lot of great people, both co-workers and managers, and was glad I was a part of the culture."
good,Best Buy is a great job for someone starting to look for a career but has not currently found one. The atmosphere is good and the work isn't too physically demanding. it offers you a chance to learn how to be a productive worker. I would recommend it to someone as their first or second job.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed learning about the new products and expanding my knowledge to other parts of the stores.
good,"A typical day at work, I would organizing the shelves and put items in alphabetical order, inquire customers about products that they are interested in. I learned in this job that approaching customers would help strive sells and provide them with knowledge that they didn't previously not know. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends in all different departments."
good,"typical retail store with managers who only care about their dollar, not employee concerns"
good,"It was a good place to work, the best part of the job was its people."
good,"My brief stint with Best Buy Mobile was short but effective. I was able to be introduced to the cell phone industry, Best Buy Mobile is a company I would recommend for anyone wanting to get into the cell phone industry to be a stepping stone. I worked with the four major cell phone companies."
good,it has been great woking with best buy. i have alwayz felt like a bif family with the team and everyone.
good,A great place to work if you are in to Electronics and bling. Nice people at this company as well.
good,"Management sucks, employees are cool. Computer training is outdated and unuseful but mandatory. No commissions, hourly wage isn't good."
good,Fun and productive. Equal opportunity. Ability to grow within the company. Competitive pay and offers benefits to most associates.
good,"I enjoyed parts about working there but it seems the pressure is on certain departments to make the money for the store while the others are left to just walk around and organize the store. I don't mind it so much, it just doesn't seem like the most efficient way to run a business."
good,Great company that has flexible hours. Perfect for the college student!
good,"fast paced retail that requires a lot of knowledge, not enough compensation for work. Managers are strict and unkind."
good,Best Buy is a place where customer service is the most important asset. Product knowledge is also a key factor for employees as well.
good,I wish I could give a review for this company and its jobs but unfortunately I was not employed there for very long.
good,"A good place to work with a fun and exciting atmosphere. Diversity and the ability to learn about electronics and connected solutions. Working for Best Buy can be a great experience, with opportunities of growth within the company being very achievable."
good,"I worked in the geek squad department and the team was great to work with, but I received little to no support from the stores management."
good,"If you're a college student or someone that just wants some extra income and a decent discount on electronics, then this job is right for you. There is very little room for advancement however."
good,Good student job can get very busy and hectic at times. Sometimes hard to get hours.
good,"It was fun for the short ammount of time that I was there, but towards the end I felt shunned and left out of a lot of things."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy Mobile is a great environment. Unfortunately, unless you are a key holder it is very unlikely that you will get hours outside of the holidays. The pay is good, but not enough to make up for the lack of hours."
good,I can honestly say that this company involves there employees in wanting to grow the company. They value there employees.
good,Working in this company has taught me to be responsible and about customer service. I worked for this company for 5 years and because of it I can exceed in my other job
good,• Greet customers with products and services
good,"It was fun working in the gaming department during the holiday season, but then went severely downhill. Management there worried only about getting credit applications from the customers and percentages. Not how you interacted with customers, how well you explained things, your innovation, or leadership."
good,I have worked at best buy in two different location
good,Work with cutting edge home technology. Sell Things. Very Boring.
good,awesome job for beginners to learn whats expected in a job. don't get comfortable being in the same position long company likes to reorg every two years
good,Management style seems to be one of keeping you in your toes. Seems they like to introduce the write up procedure early and like to keep you on some sort of documentation as leverage to get the performance they expect out of you
good,The company was cool but the internal issues at my location I worked at was unprofessional. This predicted my patience and enjoyment with the company.
good,This is a pretty decent company to work for. The work culture is phenomenal and the people are very friendly but the only draw back is that training is practically non existent. You are just thrown in the the mix and expected to perform.
good,If you need a job Best Buy is a place to work. Cool people. Works with school schedule. Not a lot of hours unless full time. But good people and good vibes.
good,"I am beginning to regret the positive judgement of all my time at Best Buy simply because of this review essay, and its only the first sentence. Although, it was a pretty good job."
good,I enjoyed my job and position at Best Buy at first until I started noticing all the favoritism that goes on within the company and the injustice with co workers.
good,A good blend of mental and physical labor with the flexibility of being on the go. Great skills to learn and carry forward in the career. Job offers a wide variety of technology to use and learn
good,"Best Buy is a fun job, but every employee in the building deals with an avalanche of issues, particularly the operations teams.  Sales people play on their phones a lot, while managers live at work, holding the building up.  The product is fun, and even the customer part is easy.  But the amount of inventory issues and theft that takes place in a single store is mind boggling.  Product trucks come in very disorganized and not enough labor is given to deal with operational issues.  DMs come in and literally invent more work to do, and bulk stacks of TVs take priority over everything else in the store.  As an ops leader it’s easy to lose sleep over this job, and if you’re there a long time, you’ll look up a decade older and wonder where your career went."
good,"Every one who I worked with was kind, understanding, able to take jokes. and beyond helpful in some cases, it felt like a real family. However I felt like i was a number at points, I was held to ridiculous standards, and there is no room for advancement or pay increases."
good,The teams are all focused on the client/customer experience which allows the right work to get done.Tremendous energy and time is put into company alignment to ensure that each team knows the big picture and how their individual work contributes to the goals of the organization.
good,"There are certainly worse companies to work for, but if you want your efforts to mean something, this is not the job for you. You come here to make ends meet."
good,It's not the worst place I've ever worked. As a Merchandiser I'm there extremely early to change prices and set the store for the day. They push a very ethical business front but workplace culture can vary widely and it can be prone to bullying occasional. Mostly interpersonal coworker issues.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The store that I worked at did not allow APs to have chairs by their podium. I have worked from open to close for most days but was never allowed to take a seat as one of the supervisors said it doesn’t look good if I sit. It doesn’t have to be like that. Standing for long periods of time hurts your back overtime.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Best Buy. The branch I was at in Kanata had lots of fun people to work with, a good management team, and good clients. I made friends here that I still speak to and hang out with from time to time if I'm in the area. Sure, the pay isn't great, you don't really get many benefits, but there is opportunity to advance if you make a name for yourself. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend working there to people looking for a part time job whilst in school."
good,"Enjoyed working here. The people are nice , employees tend to stay here for extended time . I would recommend if you need a job that will work with your school schedule. If you fold easy under pressure I would not recommend."
good,"Average retail work environment. Management was professional, and there were decent opportunities to move up in the company if you desire. I'm not a huge fan of working retail but if you have to work retail Best Buy seems like an appropriate option. I got paid more than fast food so that's why I worked there."
good,Best buy allowed me to advance and become a better computer expert. I solved many problems and forged friendships that still last me until this day. I am grateful I got the opportunity to learn here.
good,"It was an on job for the pay, wasn't hard work, just tedious. Wouldn't recommend it you want something to stimulate your mind. It really is just mindless repetitive work."
good,"Not a lot of room for growth they only promote  those the current management like. Flexible hours, ok benefits for full timers and paid sick days. Good employee discount but pay isn't very competitive  or good. Expect a 2% raise at 6 months then yearly from there"
good,The job is easy but the employees definitely make the job. I eventually got tired of working there because I just realized that wasn't something I wanted to do.
good,"Typical retail job. Flexible schedule, poor pay, poor benefits."
good,"Great people to work with as long as you stay on their good side. (Mainly looking at management in this case)"
good,"Listen - I'm not in the business of bashing my employer. I love all my coworkers, honestly. All of the people I work with are wonderful to work with, and the large majority of my coworkers are kind, understanding, and helpful. There are some good benefits, there are some good perks to being an employee, and if you perform well, there's always the possibility of climbing that corporate ladder. The management team at my store is exceedingly competent, and the majority of the management staff truly seems to care about their employees. "
good,If you are working on customer interactions then this is the place to really stretch your legs. Often times the most interesting cases happens and causes you to think on your feet.
good,It wasnt a bad company. I can only remeber how I felt back then.Looking back it's a good corporate company to work for sometimes I miss the enviroment
good,"During my time working at Best Best, I worked in multiple departments until my position with the mobile phones sales.  I learned all the phone plans and current offers to sell our services and help solve any problems the customer may have had with any plans prior."
good,Try to solve client hardware/software in a timely manner based on estimated completion. I learned that you must have tough skin for customers. The most enjoyable part was learning how to take apart an Iphone for repairs.
good,"The company is overall pretty good. Offer great benefits, the pay is too low especially since I have years of retail management experience. My location  Lack true full time hours (is 40 hours) I don’t see advancement in near future which is what I seek. I’m not sure if I will stay another year."
good,"I worked here for almost a year, and there are coworkers who will laugh in your face but will tell on you in a heartbeat behind your back. I was hired through a temp service for the position. After the 3 months was up I was offered a position for full time. Management on the Jr position was ok but the General management staff were great and always took time out to hear about your concerns and acted fast if there was a problems(s) that was happening in their stores."
good,"Appreciated all the experiences I gained and I learned different tasks that I know will be valuable in any job I will seek in the future.  The workplace culture is idealistic and people enjoy many fun stuff the company offers.  However, people always feel insecure about their jobs and in some areas, people do not feel compensated enough on their work or not recognized accordingly by upper mgmt. I'd say one must work hard, enjoy what s/he does, do not be complacent, NO One is indispensable!"
good,"I dont like those times, is very different..."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Nice place to start of any kind of retail experience but it’s not to great if you go to school and work full time because you hardly have time to separate work and school because of the long hours working and getting home exhausted.
good,"Great place to work, especially if still in school. Great experience."
good,basic cashier position. I did not enjoy working here. I did not see myself moving up and if your position is seasonal then you are going to stay seasonal
good,Hitting budget is crucial and if its missed then management can be a bit aggressive with tactics to improve. Better sell like crazy or your getting 1 shift a week. Lots of snakes in management so do not trust any of them they are your boss and not your friend cause they will turn on you if it means saving themselves from head office.
good,I had a few issues with management that drove me away from the location. I’m not getting into it but co-workers were cool and sales goals were not hard but are pushed heavily.
good,"Suele ser más el sacrifico de tiempo, pero aprendes mucho"
good,"Solid benefits and relatively good work environment. Unfortunately, with retail there is a high turnover rate and pressure due to sales expectations. Good entry level job and there is chance for promotion due to high turnover and promotions are primarily done internally."
good,"Good opportunity, usually chances to move up the ladder there.  Also a good part-time job, nice discount and flexible hours as well.  Worked there a long time, usually opportunities to grow and ability to transfer to other locations if interested."
good,"As long as you have a little bit of sales experience and are competent with speaking to people you can work at Best Buy. A typical day at work is going in finding out what sales goals are for the day and to just go out there and do your job. Coworkers make this job fun, Best Buy is really good at making culture unique to every store. One of the things that you tend to notice though is that its very hard to move up, if you're a college student just trying to make a buck and get a discount then this place is perfect. As time goes on you realize how hard it is to move up since many people have been there for years and have been groomed to move up to full-time then management and so on so forth."
good,Good place to work however management is not a always the best. Good place for college or high school kids. Good for someone starting out as their first job. Unfortunately not too many career advancement options
good,"Perfect first time job, lots of hours if in the right department, many different things to learn, staff is friendly and management is trustable. Diverse fields of knowledge, and you will learn something new everyday."
good,"You're experience will be directly affected by the management in the store. Good management = good environment, and vice versa. The pay is low for the amount of work you do, and if you do a good job you go unnoticed alot of the time."
good,Great company to work for when I started. The culture seems to change so quickly that you start to lose your passion or excitement for a tech company. But as a “first job” it’s great to start at.
good,"Employees come in and immediately get to work with helping out customers with questions or comments about products. Management can be helpful at times, but overall, a nice place to work for beginners and opportunites to advance."
good,"-Typical work day is productive and fun"
good,I only worked part time but obviously if you don’t hit sales goals you’re watched more closely and they don’t give you hours or micro manage you even though the sales goals are a little crazy but management  doesn’t  want to hear that.
good,"Good place to work, lot of hours during season. Slows down a lot after season. Would be better if it was a 40 hour a week job. Pay is good, that have plenty of activity for employees to be involved in. Big place so there’s a lot of deferent departments to work in and lots to learn."
good,"If you like technology, this is the place for you. The ability to learn and sell products is amazing. Furthermore, the flexibility is great for students. Nonetheless, be ready to work holidays!"
good,I like the culture and the people I meet. I still keep in touch with my co workers from the city I would work for Best Buy again I. D.o.n.t know if I’d work security
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Helped with polishing my skills and groomed my customer service ideals. I was given opportunities to explore more roles and giver more responsilities.
good,"Best Buy was my first ever job, I started my second semester in high school as a part timer and quit upon graduating college (5 years later). It's a good job if you're part time and in school, they are pretty flexible. Hours can vary, I chose to work as many hours as they would give me (up to 37 hours weekly sometimes). But when it's slow they will toss you to the side and give you 8-12 hours a week. It's inconsistent. I worked at Best Buy through all the restructures it had but never had a terrible manager until the end of my career there."
good,"Worked as a brand ambassador and worked with an incredible team that helped me understand various services to sell. The pay was not much and the hours were hit or miss. Overall it is great if you are looking to challenge yourself and add some sales, management and technical skills on your resume."
good,"Work culture was not all that bad, employees actually bonded life family."
good,People don't move up quickly. It is hard to move up the ladders as there are a lot of level and people are not moving. You also need to business case your promotion.
good,If you get the job and you want hours good luck becuase you probably won't get them and management tries to do there best but fail. at my store we where under staffed but I have heard stories that other stores where worse
good,"Fun Place to work, Management could have been better.  The culture of Best  Buy was work hard, play hard. It was a great starting place for my career in design"
good,"Worked in the computer sales department with a team of great salesmen and women. Supervisor helped me to understand a great sum of tactics to close sales. The product I was considerably more knowledgeable than any of my peers, yet i didn't have any sales experience before. Great learning experience that was completely spoiled by the management at the time. Was terminated based on a lie, and never had the chance to get a fair shake at my own credibility."
good,"Meet a lot of clients and resolve issues for them daily. Fun upbeat culture, surrounded by new tech on the regular. Great benefits. Training is very lackluster for all roles."
good,I've worked at Best Buy for little over two years I was okay to that with but later I feel like management never did anything to really help out their employees they're flexible yes but when it came down to year end raises or equal play they threw you under the bus 0 seconds flat.
good,"My managers were more than happy with my performance, I received compliments from executives visiting the store, I was thanked for the extra work I put in, and my managers publicly recognized me for the job I was doing. I was even offered training to move up and gain other skills in the company. The training never came, and I asked every other week for any updates, distant enough to not be an annoyance, close enough together to convey interest, and was told it would happen each time. After a few months of nothing, I began to apply for positions higher in the company as they opened up, and management acted excited, and would inform me my chances were good each time, only for regular outside hires that wouldn't last more than 2 months. Eventually a position higher within my department but still below management opened up, and my department head and General Manager told me to apply and that this was guaranteed. When I did not receive the job I asked my direct supervisor about the position and I was told it was going to someone from outside the company who had higher qualifications. Two weeks later the newest member of our team who started one month prior, who I was fast friends with and held the same qualifications as, had filled that position. If you're good at your job, make the numbers, get good surveys from customers, and make them look good, they don't actually want to help you move up, because then they lose those numbers. It's great for holding a position, bad for moving forward. My managers were at least personable and friendly while I was there, and are great references,"
good,Very nice experience working with this company and actually was one of my favorite jobs I've held. Was unfortunate when I got laid off and if given the opportunity I would go back to work for this company.
good,"Given that it's a huge, publicly-traded consumer retail corporation, my personal experience at Best Buy was overall a positive one. Of course, it suffers from the problems that plague almost all large retail chains (lazy/indifferent/capricious mid-level management, popularity-based career advancement, unrealistic sales goals,etc). That being said, they are significantly better than other ""big box"" stores in a few areas. Most impressively, they at least attempt to train their employees (at least the sales staff). At the time I was hired (2015), it was mandatory that all sales personnel attend a week-long sales course led by a dedicated trainer. Admittedly, these classes focus way to much on sales strategies, but its a nice gesture and pretty refreshing when compared to companies that stick you in front of a computer for a few days before throwing you out on the floor. The main improvement I would suggest here is adding a component to the class that teaches new employees the basics of the products they're going to be selling- because, as a customer service associate, 95% of your customer interaction is going to be people asking you what the ""best brand"" of something is. Even if you're generally pretty tech-savvy, not many people know the tech specs of all the stuff they're asked to hawk. It's pretty incredible the level of technical skill people expect out of a sales associate making $10/hour."
good,"Sign in, go to your station, & do as instructed. "
good,It was interesting to work with them however as an inexperinced person for sales newcomer I needed more guidance and training instead of more training I was put into backstocking. Hours were from 3am to 12pm almost 1pm at some points there was no bonus and overtime pay was not worth the extra hours of work only about a couple of cents I believe at the time I worked
good,"Not a bad place, management was terrible but your coworkers were great. They helped you with hours and also they would help you succeed. Not a bad place to work"
good,"Relatively good managements, but we were understaffed so some employees did not pull their weight with little fear of repercussions. Overall good job."
good,"Working at Best Buy is a great job for anyone in school or needing part-time work. However, unless you desire a path to management, you may want to consider another employer."
good,"Good for college"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,i’ve been working here a couple years now but I feel like for all I do there isn’t much room to move up. Favoritism is a huge part of it and that’s what ruins the job honestly. Also it seems like the “adult” in my store like to cause drama. It’s a great job is you miss the high school drama.
good,"At my location there was a lot of autonomy to do your job. Though, you did have to put up the charade of looking productive for management even when no customers were in the store."
good,"Best buy is a decent place to work especially if you were trying to find a foothold into the job market. Additionally, it provides flexible hours making it a valuable supplementary job for for those who need more discretion with their time or  simply want additional income. "
good,"I had worked at best buy for about 6 years and had worked in a few different positions over those 6 years. With a lot of the restructuring they had done and changes to the retail locations I feel the quality of the work place had started to go down and there was no clear direction anymore. It was enjoyable to work there with a lot of the great people I met over the years and I always enjoyed the companies position on helping people, however the overall experience towards the end of me working there was much less enjoyable than when I started"
good,I learned how to deal with difficult customers over the phone. Everything there was pretty relaxed and allowed you to go as far as ou can to help the customer.
good,"The people that you work with and the things you learn from the training and people are great. When it came to doing the job itself, it was ""ok"" depending on what you were doing. As a sales rep it was like any other retail job, it wasn't the greatest due to the little pay and the amount of things that you dealt with, especially customers. Another thing that was terrible is that everything was depending on if you were able to sell a credit card, if you were not good at that you would get looked down upon and more than likely your yearly raise would just maybe, just maybe pass 30 cents. Working as a Customer Service Rep, it was like any other customer service/ register job, but then again everything came down the sale and if you were able to get a credit card out. Working as a Geek Squad Agent was something a little different because you actually fixed issues for people. Even though the job was to fix things it still came down to the fact of the amount of the sale or if you were able to get the customer to buy a plan or if you were able to get a credit card out. In Geek Squad it was a very gray area because you were torn between to either to  fix this persons issue with no charge and deal with the repercussions after or, you can charge the person a nice paycheck and then fix the issue with no repercussion, even though as an agent number one priority was to fix customer issues. Geek Squad was a very gray area. The management was decent, don't expect to go up in the company because you have very little chance to move up, especially if you were good at selling credit cards, when"
good,Working at Best buy is a decent job and comes with some benefits.  the company cares little about its employees financial needs and provides little in the way of solid training.
good,"I loved working with the company before they decided that sales were more important than customer experience. Most of the management was amazing but as with all companies you have a few bad apples. There was some mild discrimination but complaints about that are handled swiftly and directly. They were even amazing when I had to take an extended leave of absence for medical reasons. Unfortunately, the company decided that ""every customer MUST leave with a receipt"" philosophy appliances really require the old ""every customer must have a great experience and an expert consultation"" philosophy. Appliance sales (my department) decreased when the new business model was implemented because if they wanted to feel pressured they could go to a competitor where sales were commission based."
good,This specific location was fairly slow as it was located in a mall where there was a big box best buy store most customers went there. Management is great and sales culture is fair. Huge draw back to working for best buy mobile is that you do not make commission.
good,I like working there because it kept me occupied. I didn't like working there because of the long hours. I enjoyed learning new things & meeting new people. I just really didn't have time for my family.
good,Plan de desarrollo deberia ser mas activo y objetivo
good,"I loved working at Best Buy, but as a parent of two I just wasn't making enough money at Best Buy to help make my ends meet. So I left to finish school."
good,"Benefits were pretty good. Included 401k, employee stock purchase, education reimbursement, health, dental, eye care. Pat toward higher end of retail spectrum. Relaxed atmosphere to work in."
good,"I have a primary job, and Best Buy was flexible enough with my hours, understanding enough with my schedule, and willing to help me make both jobs work. No issues."
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and at times multiple customers at once. But you learn a lot about technology and meet lots of great people along the way (customers and co-workers).
good,Great place to start out and start working. Lots of training that will help in the future. I have worked there for many years and they really do invest in their people.
good,This is not a place for a serious career.Its just a paycheck. They are more concerned with employees making them top money but only pay the bare minimum
good,je n'ai pas travailler là assez longtemps mais j'étais caissière dans le temps des fêtes et ce n'étais pas facile. peu de pause pour le trop grand nombres de clients
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It's probably one of the better retail jobs a techy, geeky person can have. If you understand basic electronics and modern appliances, this part-time job is for you."
good,"I believe that the hardest part of the job was selling the insurances on the items, and meeting my daily sales quota. Other than that the discount was amazing."
good,"Best buy was a fun job to work at the time. After awhile, they completely stopped giving me hours. There were weeks where i wasn't even on the schedule. Yes the job was fun but i would only want to work as a full time employee for the company."
good,It is a good starter job. They teach you discipline and how to sell. I gained valuable skills and a great work ethic. The discount and my fellow employees were the two things that kept me going for two and a half years.
good,Best buy is a fast pace work environment. They work with your schedule and provide frequent assessments to assure staff is up to date with company protocol.
good,"el trabajo es tranquilo y llevadero, aquí puedes desempeñarte para tener experiencia laboral y puedes mantener tus costos de vida privada ya que el sueldo es mínimo y si no tienes responsabilidades cono mantener tus estudios."
good,"You sell to customers in a typical technology retail environment. You do have to have a pretty in-depth knowledge of all the product, and what they pay you for is not competitively worth it. It does however, open other doors for other job opportunities in other fields and companies. For instance, Spectrum Telecommunications."
good,I was a sales associate in multiple departments. It was a part time / seasonal position. There is always room to grow within large companies. I changed jobs after my position there was up.
good,Hours a pretty flexible with managers that are 50/50. There are some bias towards promotional opportunities. Holidays is where the frustration tends to set in.
good,Low pay no incentive to sell up and constant demand for extended warranties with no reward. Only managers get the bonus making it an uncomfortable work environment
good,"Bon environnement de travail , accompagnement et encadrement des nouveaux recrut adéquat."
good,"its a job gotta work ,its a okay play to work. management change up so often. so don't get to use to one singe supervisor cause the change fast. chance to move around within the plant to learn new jobs."
good,"The job itself is great, compensation started out higher in the area, but lately has not been keeping up (McDonalds starts out with the same pay, but you can count on more hours there). The management encourages personal growth, however I get the feeling that your performance isn't as important as how you fit in with the leadership when it comes to advancement."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fun team oriented place to work. However fluctuating hours for part time employees is frustrating after holiday season. Hours are initially increased over holidays and then significantly decreased after.
good,"Worked for two years, hours were slightly flexibility some managers had really good hearts.Hard part is hitting goals in such a small area, expecting to sell 700 dollars an hour.  Best part were some of the people that worked there."
good,"I was in the Advanced Repair Agent position at best buy and I learned quite a bit about resolving issues on all operating systems. Most of my day was spent fixing computers, and sometimes having to do customer facing rolls throughout the day. The company provides pretty good training, but there isn't a lot of room to move up."
good,"Competitive sales orientated environment. There are always updates in the products that are being sold as well as any services that qualify. The toughest part of the job depends on the department you work in. For the full-time positions, expectations are set to a near unreasonable level in the most extreme cases. Company metrics often took priority over associate well being. Room for growth feels quite restricted (depends on the store). Management offers positions to move up to only a certain degree. Upper management is very well rooted in the company so further promotion is very unlikely unless you transfer to a different store. The sales goals are realistic in some cases but the feeling of inadequacy exists when you do not reach those goals. In the slower months management ""cracks the whip"" in a sense to drive employees to sell more to every client that comes in even if it's just one or two. some managers will also lack urgency when it comes to dealing with internal system issues. The coworkers are very well liked but when it comes to the work ethic, most associates feel as if they are not being properly lead by example but ordered around to hit certain goals"
good,A good company to work for that cared about promoting good talent from within.  The culture was very team-oriented and competitive and expected a lot from you for just meager pay and benefits.
good,"On a typical day, I was scheduled as either in loss prevention or inventory, depending on the needs of the store. I enjoyed learning about loss prevention, but the shifts were long and boring. I enjoyed working in the inventory department. I worked out freight, picked and shipped orders, organized receiving, and re-stocked shelves as needed. I tracked inventory movement and completed all opening and closing paperwork for the inventory department. At times I felt the atmosphere was a bit too relaxed. A lot of my co-workers would stand around and watch me work. That's one of the reasons I left. Sales associates would have social hour on the sales floor. At times I felt like I was back in High School, but with grown adults. At this location, promotion was unlikely due to the problems created by nepotism. Many qualified individuals were overlooked for promotion due to this. Yet, overall all the people I worked with were cool."
good,"my manager was not great or friendly all the time. i was young and the money was good considering i was in high school, however, the managers seemed to hate their jobs and lives and would often take it out on the employees. like i said though this was years ago and at one specific location so i would recommend it to certain people"
good,It is a very easy going environment. It's retail so no surprise the scheduling is terrible but they work with you for the most part. It can be a  pretty fun place to work at.
good,Experience depends on the location. Standard minimum wage job. Some processing and favoritism issues. Much opportunity for growth up to a certain point.
good,"You have to be very structured with your time to get all tasks completed.  If you don't like constant change this is the wrong place for you to work.  Guidance and expectations can vary from store, district and territory across the company."
good,It was pretty fun and cool to be around those the same age as you but eventually the structure and rule changes made it a less enjoyable atmosphere. Good location
good,"Worked in the warehouse for the majority of my time. Quite a fast paced environment, as any warehouse will be. Great co-workers and atmosphere, easily the best part of the job. Work/life balance is not good, no benefits for part time or seasonals. Amount of work and staying extra is not worth the pay."
good,"Work At Home, Customer Service Dispatch, Repair"
good,"Its a pretty okay job. The only thing that makes working here worth it, are your co-workers. The people that work here really want to help you and are really friendly. Its easy to make good friends here. The management was okay. they have different managers for each department and rotate them for whose the standing manager if the general manager isn't there. Work to life balance is good. Its part-time, so they place you as needed. Overall, its a good job to get started working if you never had a job before, but its not to be a ""forever"" job!"
good,Its nice to work there when you have good employees and management. Schedules and availability are not so flexible. Best Buy cares alot about their customers and strives to give them an amazing experience
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, solo el horario y ubicación en aquel momento no era el ideal para mí."
good,It felt like everyone was constantly running around like a chicken with their head cut off. Management was only slightly terrible. Awful pay for how they overwork you.
good,"The job itself is fine and coworkers are incredible. But there are major problems with the management. Favoritism is a huge problem in the store and many people are targeted or given better treatment. This includes promotions, and raises as well."
good,"Financially Best Buy was a great place to work for. The pay and benefits were awesome. The only complaint I really had working there, along with others, was the favoritism management had with certain associates."
good,The hours were average. The money was average. The leadership was average. The days were average. The employees were all average. The meetings that we had to do were average. It was all average.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best buy is a fun job but you will not make enough money to live off of. I met alot of great people there and I love technology so it was alot of fun. If you are a college student this is a great job to have in between classes, however if you have bills to pay or a family to feed I would not suggest this job."
good,best buy is alright to work for i was lucky enough to with a decent manger but all in all im half way with if i would go back. I wouldnt mind trying out in the geek squad postion.
good,it was a chill work space but i would alwasy get yelled at for no reason the management wasnt that good the uniform wasnt that comfortbale and the pay was really bad
good,There is always something to do as long as you find it. Always busy with lots of customers and management is willing to help as long as you speak up. Although it can feel like family it can also be a high school with the way coworkers are towards each other. The hardest part is keeping up with everything and not feeling like you have to oversell just to keep up. The most enjoyable part is getting to know different people of different cultures.
good,Retail in general isn't for me but Best Buy was pretty fast-paced which I enjoyed but customers will always be naive to the company's policy which WILL test your patience. Any slight inconvenience will get the customer mad. Learning everything from lingo to policies with store pick-ups is crucial.
good,"It is retails sales so there are a lot of part time young people who might not have the best work mentality.  Other people are dedicated, hard-working, and just want to enjoy their time selling awesome electronics to people."
good,Okay to work there. Worked in mobile department which was chaotic 24/7. Doesn't mane sense to have a mobile department that isn't backed by the major suppliers.
good,"The place is great for a first time job, but long term it is hard to move up. I did love the people I worked with it made the job better. Expect alot of changes, some good and some bad."
good,"Meh could have been better could have been worse. Strict favortism to some employees. Kinda cliqued up, as in if you're not apart of it you wont go very far."
good,"Worked three different departments, learned all I could.  Felt there wasn't a lot of opportunities for advancement.  Had good managers, was treated fairly.  Enjoyed working with the public and other employees.  Expected to work Black Friday for at least 12 hours every year.  Pay rate could be higher."
good,Just pick a good store where your managers will look after you and treat you right. If you do your job and stay low you should be okay but promotions are based on favoritism not merits.
good,Working at the company for about 8 months had proven that the company was a fair one to work for and the management in the establishment was more than competent and helpful.
good,Best buy was a good experience to learn and able to communicate well with others. I learned a lot about product knowledge and customer service experience.
good,"very sales oriented and pushy about making goals.  Upper management doesn't seem to care much about the employees just sales, but most of the supervisors are good people that try their best to help you out. Best part of the job are the coworkers.  Worst part of the job is.... the job. Especially during holidays."
good,"Best Buy was a great working environment, but the amount of things you were in charge of was NOT worth minimum wage. Sales goals, mandatory monthly trainings, metric management, salesmanship and product knowledge is not worth getting paid the same as the people running the registers in the front of the store. The company is struggling as is, but underpaying employees while piling on new responsibilities is how you run a company into the ground."
good,"Starting at Best Buy was great and training was simple E-learning lessons. All the coworkers were great and proficient at their jobs but there was no current GM. A manager was filling the role as GM and did a great job, then a new GM was hired who originally worked for another company and the turnover started. A lot of staff either left or moved to another location due to new management."
good,Get good discounts and bonuses during holidays. a moderately paced work environment. Sometimes put under pressure but can be easily handled. Management expects you to work round the clock.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It was a cool place to work the managers were nice and will work with you, the coworkers were also nice and made the whole experience  great. I had a great time working there."
good,I love working for the geek squad. I just wish that there were more hours to go around instead of everything being based off of what people check in. The benefits for part timeres are only a discount and i wish we could at least get a couple of days paid time off
good,it was one of the jobs you get when you're young and it wasnt bad. Every company has its ups and downs. I worked there for a year and half and most of the time was ok.
good,This was my first job and it was a good job. It required a lot of training and knowledge. This job definitely helped me develop my skills as a salesman.
good,"Working with Geek Squad, you realize how undertrained most of their employees actually are.  It was fortunate that I came to this job trained already, as most of the other agents held little of it.  Expect to have moderate support from mid-level management, and expect to use Google to solve the harder issues."
good,"I believe 80% percent of people working there are contractors and they go through people a lot. Besides that, the managers are great and the environment is fun to work in."
good,Working for Best Buy was ok except they really didn't want to give me the drive I need to push my sales. The managers are pretty cool as well. I got along with everyone.
good,"They have been very good to me over the past 9 years."
good,"As a seasonal employee mostly working in the warehouse, there is very few customer interaction, thus, more ""chill"" than other retail jobs. Being seasonal just means the manager doesn't really care too much about your mistakes or tardiness. The most annoying position to work at Best Buy is sales associate."
good,In loss prevention you have so many rules to follow that you REALLY are there to be seen and that will make the theif “go away”. I didnt enjoy this position
good,I enjoyed Associates I enjoyed the customers but cannot financially stay because of the hours of a part-time associate. The discounts there as an associate was respectable. The education you received is appreciated. I will work there any time again for part-time position or full-time.
good,"El ambiente y las prestaciones son excelentes, así como la cultura de la empresa, pero deja que desear en la parte de gerencia y salarios, ya que son muchas horas por lo que pagan, al menos en Cancún"
good,They pay well but my location did close down. The job had its up and downs like every job. I really enjoyed my coworkers. They worked very well with my school schedule.
good,"Enjoyed my time there, employee discount and accommodations were great. However management made work not enjoyable. They pay you for a 4 day training at the corporate offices which was nice."
good,only worked here part time regular associates only get a certain amount of benefits mangers get most of the better benefits so if you are going for a manager position this would be a good place to work at.
good,it was stressful but managers helped keep it afloat. Not really sure what else to say besides that scheduling was kind of terrible. There would be time it would be packed and other employees would be MiA
good,I started as a Consultation agent and quickly was promoted ton Advanced Repair Agent. Cool place to start out in the tech world and understand customer needs and expectations.
good,na i dont have a review for the company good or bad. It was a good experience to work for bestbuy. It was the first career progressive jobs ive had at a young age.
good,Just a survival job. not bad. But they will not give you enough working time if you are just a part-time. Good working environment. good chance to know about Canada's marketing.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"coworkers made your shift go by quick and never a bore with them, job can be stressful if you work the front end as customers tend to get more irate w/ you. Overall a fun job and got to take advantage of their discount policy."
good,It was okay. Better than a lot of jobs like this. Especially restaurant industry jobs. It was very focused on talking to people. It didn't feel too salesy.
good,"Started working at Best Buy when I was 18, I was terminated at age 21. It’s the best/worst job an 18-21 year old can ask for. I no longer shop nor walk into any Best Buy locations."
good,"Best Buy is a good retail environment that strives to work with equality, through education and staying ahead of the tech curve. "
good,"worked at mobile could use commission as a benefit. my managers where amazing, down to earth and cared very much about the staff. "
good,"A typical day at work includes a lot of reminders on sales culture and standard operating procedure. Sales and numbers are important but your attitude and effort is appreciated even if the numbers aren't there. However, the customers can be relentless and were often the worst part of the job. The management in-store is great but a lot of corporate procedures get in the way of your ability to please customers."
good,"I absolutely hated Alorica, it's management and the building itself. Geek Squad had great training and was very fair for pay and compensation. Wearing a uniform at a call center because people ""could hear what you're wearing"" was incredibly stupid."
good,"The benefits were the only good thing about that place. "
good,"If you have things enough done you may take your break, although it is not encouraged. The hardest part is lifting heavy things, while people ask you where things are and if the store has any."
good,unless you are one of the managers favorites you will be passed over for leadership roles within the company regardless of how many years of experience you have for said position
good,"The best thing about working at Best Buy is meeting people from all over the world and great great discounts. "
good,"Not a bad job, dealing with customers is the worst part. Customers expect alot from you. Asking questions about there device, and you are treated quite poorly by some customers."
good,"Educational and sometimes frustrating at lack of innovatory, lack of satisfaction that my skills are not being used, and language barriers.  There are  some very nice people."
good,If you going for part time get ready for the 5 1/2 hour shift they pull on workers. I never had a 8 hour shift while i was working at best buy. Also bonus is that great especially if you are in a underperforming store. One thing I hate the most is their is no commission bonus during the holidays where best buy makes the most money. Discounts are great because you pay what best buys pay to get the item.
good,"the location i worked at was not bad at all. A lot of crew member's, so you didn't feel overwhelmed or short staffed. At time i would have liked to see a bit more attention to detail and clarity with superiors."
good,its ok when you are in school and you need work but if you think this is life long job then you are mistaken. learn and move on....!! nothing too special. good co workers
good,Very competitive in terms of needing to sale product. Amazing coworkers and management helped burn through the day most of the time. Although all of this varies by location.
good,"Overall its an enjoyable job. The employees and managers get along pretty well, but if you want to get anything fixed you may as well forget about it. The Management team is more concerned with appearance and being everyone's friends than they are about correcting people and creating proper work habits. If you have an issue with how something is being handled, going to management doesn't ever solve anything. The people you get to know are all great and fun to be around. The motto is ""Have fun while being the best."" however, most people just live by ""Have fun"" and don't work hard."
good,it was fun while it lasted it was difficult to keep up with all the changing tech but it was worth it to know for future jobs. i dont know what else to say
good,The warehouse is fast paced at times mainly oct-dec the rest is slow going. Management is not that helpful it is deffinetly a who you know scenario . company loyalty is not a 2 way street employees who stuck with best buy during struggling times not NOTHING  when the company excelled and posted record profits
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at work for me depended on the flow of business for that day.  From pulling numbers to see where we were for the day to coaching employees on areas where they lacked in knowledge and skill.  I was also a key holder, if I were scheduled to open or close, I was able to open and close the building for business.  Considering that my title was Geek Squad Manager, I was basically an Assistant Store Manager but was not salaried.  While being in management, I was able to learn the ends and outs of how a Best Buy store works, basically fully grasp the things that customers do not see.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training and coaching the employees, and gaining that much needed trust from them."
good,"Standard retail position, worked within mobile department supporting lead. Tasks varied on a day to day basis, with a big emphasis on increasing growth and maximizing sales."
good,"Work atmosphere was okay, great coworkers."
good,"I worked for Best Buy while in school because they were willing to work with my schedule. I enjoyed my coworkers more than I enjoyed working there, but the job wasn't bad."
good,Its been a long time since i worked there. I worked during the opening of the first store in Columbus GA. I can remember it was intense as the store was as much a draw just because of how new it was and people wanting to buy things. I do recall them strongly encouraging the sale of all kinds of add ons yet gave no commissions.
good,You help customers pick out products and services that they need help identifying what devices will help make their lives easier. You need to have a varying skill level with electronic devices to inform customers of their options.
good,"It was a lack of work that drove me out of there. At times it felt like the store was closing down just because of how slow it had become I imagine with the inflation of amazon, ebay, and other digital markets coming in selling electronic devices at a lower rate I cant imagine how much longer Best Buy will be open."
good,"Managers are very sales oriented and don't care about entry level employees.  "
good,"They are retail. They have to make money, obviously. They focus a lot on what the customer experience looks like, and that often times means being asked to do things outside your comfort level, such as constantly asking someone if they need anything or asking if they would like to look at the better model or what have you. Moral battles can be frequent here, as I am against needlessly opening credit accounts, but we are partly rated on how many credit applications we can get in X amount of time. Management is hit or miss. There are amazing managers, and then there are garbage managers. Leadership between line-level and managers are also a gamble. Sometimes the non-management leaders far out-perform the management, and other times you wonder what they had to do and for who to get the job they were in. "
good,A lot of product management and customer service with different types of attitudes on a daily basis. Very fast paced and making sure that inventory is as close to perfect as possible.
good,It was a pretty good seasonal job. Nothing to stressful or strenuous however all they care about is getting credit card applications. So there's that.
good,Working there for over three months as a seasonal worker was good. I learned great communication skills. Most employees were friendly and helpful. A typical day is rooming your department looking for customers. Trying to persuade someone to purchase something can be difficult.
good,"People who are going to work here have to keep in mind, this is a retail job that sales high valued electronics. Working during the holidays is mandatory."
good,It was a fun place when I first started but soon realized you need to know someone to move up. It's not based of performance or how good you are at your job. Great place if you are a student and wanting a first time job.
good,"The job can have days where it seems like things are easy where you do the same ""dance"" all the time. Others not so much where the day can feel like its against you. Never be afraid to ask for help if you need it, never be afraid to offer it if you see someone else in need of it."
good,"On a usual day, it is slow but productive. Workers are friendly (on certain days). Some managers usually tend to action towards you without you being aware. You will mainly enjoy the discounts and a few people."
good,"It's retail, all the same. Bad bosses = Bad experience there. Good bosses = good experience. Too bad most people fail their way to the top so you're stuck with the latter."
good,"Just a part time job while I was attending college. Mangers did the best they could in accommodating my schedule. Work culture was good, co-workers for the majority were awesome; minus the typical douche. lol"
good,very relaxed place to work. all the employees help each other. the manager is very nice and knows how to run the store properly I enjoy my job for now.
good,"It was a good overall experiences, the company itself is amazing. There are many opportunities to advance oneself professionally. At the store I worked at there was a close knit relationship within the team which was good."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for entry level retail. They will teach you skills that you will use for the rest of your life. However, they are not the place to work for anyone in mid-management. The company is constantly restructuring and no job is safe. I knew this going in to and used my time as a manager with Best Buy to build my resume and move on."
good,"Great place to work if interested in technology.  Great on the job training.  Management can be sour and changes constantly.  People are great, always easy to find a new friend.  Stressful environment most the time."
good,"Wonderful place to work . Understanding management flexible schedule. High energy around holiday time. Two thumbs up. Honestly a great place to work, no complaints"
good,"I worked at the lowest paying Best Buy in our district. Minimum pay increases on the yearly IF AT ALL. Employee discount was cool, working around tech was awesome. I was passionate about the tech, but at the end of the day all they care about are selling plans and add ons, unrealistic goals for department sales. Valued pushiness and phoniness over genuine customer service and honesty. Not a whole lot of upward movement but if you buy into the corporate culture you stand a chance."
good,"I worked there as a connected sales consultant years ago and it was awesome. The management was great, the people were great, and everyone knew what they were talking about. My experiences with Best Buy as a consumer have not been great though. Seems their turnover is massive and people are ignorant about the products they're selling. things have seemed to change."
good,"You stay busy throughout your day with stocking and selling. The works not all that hard there's just a lot of it. The people are not to bad, management is very unorganized. But it is retail so I would say for a retail job its not all bad."
good,"I'm sure the overall company is great, also with outstanding benefits. But unless you really are connected in a social circle there's no room for growth."
good,"I've worked with Best buy for more than 2 years, and I loved everything I did as a sales employee. I loved talking to people, I loved the benefits of the job, and I loved what I did. However, I can not stand the money based mentality of the management there. You will be pressured into making people but, and you will deal with everyone treating the job like a commission job, even though it isn't."
good,"Employees have a sense of helplessness, managers are mostly incompetent. However a fun work enviornment, employee discount is very nice, information about electronics industry is also worth something."
good,Best Buy is an adult toystore. Be prepared to be asked questions about anything and expected to know everything. It is a results driven company with stress on profitablility.
good,"Loved it.   Even during the holidays.  On some days the pace was extremely fast and on other days it was extremely slow paced.  As long as you follow the guidelines and do wha the company is paying you to do, you will enjoy and excel there."
good,"Although Bestbuy has a competitive environment, it is a pleasure working there. I learned that you should treat everyone with the same respect that you would want, because you never know who is who.Management was okay, it was lacking in the attentive department but beside that aspect, it was nice. The most enjoyable part was the competition aspect. Management would always reward employees, which is great because it showed their appreciation of going above and beyond"
good,"This company is a pretty good environment. I've been at this company for a year, and it's enjoyable enough. I don't mind the management or the people there. Most people are kind and caring and fairly understanding."
good,Great structure to increase knowledge and sales processes. Working face to face with customers makes it easy to demonstrate the latest and greatest technology.
good,There are definitely some aspects that can be worked on. Hard to back up the training that you're supposed to do if the management doesn't back you up on completing them within the workplace.
good,This place allowed me to grow very fast and have fun working with electronics. The environment is quite corporate and ultimately the higher-ups just want you to achieve sales and hit your measurables as far as services and warranties go.
good,Great place to work for extra money ! Also easy work . There has been a lot of managers and supervisor turn over but now it is a solid team and so far so good.
good,"Great group of people to work with, met lots of life time friends. Lots of good information to learn about cutting edge technologies, a typical day would include helping customers find the right solution for their needs."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Its an ok position, decent management, decent pay, nice to work in an open environment. The job is best with good coworkers, it can get a little busy at times."
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal and it was fine the most part, had to sell computers to people but they pushed their credit card very hard. Its what got me let go instead of hired on even though I was 4th in the district for sales. The management was very nice and were helpful for the most part. It was also a relaxing place other than a couple of angry people who thought you were duping them out of money. The hardiest part of the job was contacting other stores for merchandise for the customer. It was a pain because they didn't really want too. The best part was that I could tech and computers all day with people who could relate and wasn't hard to take breaks or go on lunch."
good,"if you want to learn how to work in customer service its a good place to start "
good,"Working at Best Buy is only fun if you have a great team around you. I was working two jobs at the time and best buy was just my side job and I used it primarily for the discount. Typically you come in and you have a goal sheet of how much to hit per hour multiplied by the number of hours you worked and everything is broken down by product, attachments, protection plans, and best buy credit cards. Once you got all your info it was time to sell and it could be fun at times but also stressful if you don't hit your goal."
good,"Its good for a college student paying their way, but don't become a lifer. Black Friday was the worst. It was my first retail job and it made me see the general public in a bad light. And I didn't like the person I became working there."
good,C'est bon comme premier travail . Cela se fait bien durant les etudes aussi.
good,"Best Buy is probably the most fun out of a job I have ever had. The people really do tend to like what they are doing. If you like electronics it's the place to be, but don't expect much on your paycheck unless you are a manager."
good,"Great place to work short time but the management is constantly changing as well as the fundamentals of the company, making it hard to find a routine in your  daily activities."
good,"The management team that I worked with was always on top about meeting objectives in all the sales departments. Working with Geeksquad set me up to working side to side with customers; many of which did not know how to operate their electronic devices. It was a charm working with the elder people, however, the job can sometimes be discouraging due to aggressive customers and due to repetition and boredom."
good,"Good seasonal or part time job excellent management "
good,se busca lograr que mas clientes adquieran su tarjeta la cual con su debida capacitación se logra al ser capacitación constante por el personal y gerente de mayor experiencia en los diversos puestos
good,Best Buy was a great place to work great benefits and etc but when it came to schedules and pay. That category lack success different employee's every week or so.
good,"lots of great people to work with a typical day is upbeat and happy "
good,"I work in the warehouse so I don't deal much with customers directly. In the mornings theres a little paperwork to do, after that I do a variety of things related to inventory; stock counts, online orders, truck shipments etc. Best part is the discount and the people."
good,"Working for GeekSquad is great in many ways, mostly depending on coworkers but it is a retail setting so managers can be terrible and often are. The job itself depending on the position doesn't have much to do with computer repair unless you are an ARA the Consultation Agents are mainly sales people, there are other positions as well, car audio installation, home television or appliance installation, or repair agents at GeekSquad City that do the physical computer repair, the company is more than just the desk."
good,"Not much more to say, it's Logistics. Expect a 60 hour work week and at the supervisory level the pay will probably be your only reward, it has been mine."
good,"While working at Best Buy I learned a lot, they handed me a lot of responsibility. As I did everything they ask, I knew that this job was not for me. The work was easy, but working until everything was done starting to get to me. One day it will be 7 hours of work and the next day it will be 16 hours of work. Working crazy hours like that become stressful. One the bright side compensation was great."
good,Best Buy has a great work culture but the management could better and the opportunity for advancement should be seriously looked at. you should not have to spend 7years at buy buy just to move up or get a raised and those who have been there longer should not get priority of another because of it which seems to mainly be the case.
good,"I liked working there, fun environment, the fact that you talk to people for 8 or 9 hours and help them by answering questions they have to improve their quality of life. But I feel like most of the time, it was a numbers game, you didn't get a pat on the back or if you are part time, and you want to be full time, you had to play the numbers game with them. They send you to a sales induction training out of state or in state and train you on sales skills. You really have to be motivated to work hard if you want to move up the chain, pay raise or even be a full time employee if you start off as part time, but nothing worth while is easy. I just wish they didn't have to many goals to reach, because it can get very overwhelming and sometimes discouraging at times."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"ECC management  changes  frequently.  Each  time that  happens, the expected work changes drastically.  The building and the benefits were quite good."
good,some days were longer than i wanted did delivery and don't like long days. however it was at times rather laid back. most mgrs were easy to get along with
good,supervisors very nice but upper management not very accessible. fun atmosphere. misinformation giving during hiring about hours. much less than told at hiring.
good,"It was overall a good experience, however at the end of my seasonal employment they never told me straight forward that they won't be hiring back. They still say they are reviewing my new schedule because of my new college schedule. "
good,Change encourages unity along all facets of the business and ultimate creates an environment where the customers wins. I have acquired leadership skills and gained knowledge around best business practices while being employed there.
good,great place to work and great culture.  I have learned a lot from many people there and want to take what I have learned and move on to something new
good,Overall the company is a great place to work. The management really makes or breaks your experience working for the company. When I first started working there the management was great but as most of the managers we had moved on the experience working at Best Buy deteriorated. The benefits are pretty good as well as the employee discount.
good,"Throughout my employment, there was many good things as well as bad things to occur. I sincerely liked most of my direct coworkers however I feel as though the management didn't care nearly enough about their employees as they should have."
good,"Overall this company has been great to me and has helped me develop new skills, and an understanding of a managers work. Unfortunately, the staff is overworked and much goes unnoticed due to the manager/employee ratio. The hardest part of this job was asking for assistance and not receiving it."
good,"Overall good experience working there with great benefits and great staff. However, can be unorganized at times and stressful."
good,"Okay job, not very good with advancements but that also depends on the branch. Goals are not very good if your looking to make money, and cap out fairly low."
good,"It was a fun experience, though it was sad when they couldn't keep me after the holidays.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and my GM was great.  The work itself was ""eh"" I wouldn't do it again."
good,"Always on the sales floor promoting and speaking with customers."
good,"Meet great people, great place to network."
good,"Typical Retail environment, no real surprises here. Good discount on products, relatively boring job, decent advancement opportunities."
good,"Great company to start with if you're trying to get your foot in the door into retail. Be prepared to start with low hourly pay, part time hours and no medical unless you work 40+ hours. You get to play with cool gadgets and the Employee discount helps."
good,"Pretty easy work environment you just have to learn how to be patient with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the working there was the friendly staff, they were always willing to help you if you got stuck."
good,"The atmosphere with the coworkers is very fun, there are constant outings put on by the management so there are plenty of opportunities to get together and make coworkers friends. My issue is the rapid turnover of employees, the lack of competent electronics with which to perform your job, and the lack of help from managers when dealing with difficult customers. "
good,Been working there for a short time now and have been saying since Day 1 I need full time due to being diabetic and need health insurance. Despite multiple positions having been applied to I have been passed up by management for people who started working after me or had not been in the company at all. Other than that my coworkers that are on my same level are nice enough and we have a good culture going throughout.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"-The co workers got me through the day most of the time."
good,Worked for 6 months. The co-workers were really friendly. Job duties were bit stressing but overall pretty good working environment.
good,The most enjoyable part of my workplace are the staff and management that are apart of it.  I have learned how to properly sell products in a place considered as retail without commission.
good,it was ok as a workplace they had good food in the break room the other team members were helpful if you had a issue sometimes the day would feel slow when no one came in the store
good,Nice Team with wonderful management. Lot of exposure to learn new technologies.All the technologies using here are latest. I'm happy to work in this kind of work environments.
good,coworkers were best part of the job. was allowed to do my job with minimal mgmt. Was allowed to be creative in doing my job. Worked with mgmt. when needed to accomplish task.
good,There is a high turnover in management as growth is difficult and constantly changing. I have learnt to be adaptable to any situation. The hardest part of any retail job is finding staff who want to be there for more than just a paycheck
good,"The job is good for a college employee."
good,"A good hourly job with great benefits if you are a tech junky.  That said, management very much pushes you to hit their daily sales metrics which can make the position a  grind considering you are not compensated via commission."
good,"If you are looking to build experience and have a well renown company name on your resume then this is a great place to work. The down side is that there is a lot of micromanaging, there isn't much room for growth, and even though it is a non-commission environment it will feel like you work on commission."
good,"A typical day at work can be anything from, slow and staying productive. To constant business with limited resources, and covering multiple positions."
good,"I worked for Geek Squad Online services for the winter period of 2015. The work can be quite be trying at times (Strange Windows 10 errors, printer issues, driver issues, etc...) ,but if you know your stuff (As I am sure you do), then it can be enjoyable to work from home as it's. The metrics that will constantly be paraded in front of you can be annoying and the management adamantly stands by it, so if you don't like to be pressured you may want to try somewhere else. Co-workers were likeable for the most part with only a couple of inflated egos that made the experience a little sour. On a busy day you may have to work with 4 clients at a time and among those 4 you may need to call one, so multitasking skills is a must. You get irate customers at times, but they are quite easy to calm most of the time. The biggest issue comes from the in-store techs who will create profound issues for you to deal with (Bad Word registrations, summoning Cthulhu from the registry, etc...) "
good,"fun work place. not a permanent job or career. very good work experience and liked working part time there most of the time, but not for the long term solution."
good,"This is a great place to work at to meet with people, inform them about the new products and helping out in picking the correct product for them. '"
good,A good place to work. You can start you career off to a good foot with best buy and develop into a solid employee with the right supervisors and managers
good,"I loved the people that I worked with and even had a few great managers. "
good,Working with electronics all day was exciting for me. I enjoyed learning about the new products we were selling. My coworkers made every day at work a little easier.
good,"Job - I like"
good,"Working at Best Buy allows me to gain a strong concept on Customer Service skills and progress my knowledge in multitasking as well as retail. I come in and process exchanges and returns, however my day can alter depending on the customer. So it prepares you to understand multitudes of customer needs. I often close due to lack of staff within my department, however my job is more challenging than a regular cashier so I do not mind the hours as much. Management has changed drastically within the last year in the store I am posted but they are willing to work with you and can be quite good to work with depending the situation. The co-workers vary and I tend to get along with everyone I work with. The hardest part of the job is getting all customers taken care of but you grow and learn from it, as it can be difficult with the angry and emotional customers. The enjoyable part for myself is the ability to do multiple things throughout the day and in a way you are constantly learning something new. I find it a little challenging to grow within the area of the business I am in, however the overall work experience I am currently gaining is satisfiable for now."
good,"The discount is the best part of this job. It's an extremely busy and fast paced environment. You are expected to always be doing something. Management could use some work on developing themselves and providing better feedback for others. If you're looking to feel rewarded and high-fived for you accomplishments, look elsewhere. Co-workers are great, like a family. You learn how to work as a team and handle problems here. Can be super stressful when it comes to customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Love some of the benefits that Best Buy offer. It could be  both hard and fun at time. But you will learn a lot in the technology world
good,Best buy is a great place to work for teens and college students. flexible schedules. you have to work there for at least 4 or 5 years to even be considered a higher position
good,"Easy part time job if your in school. Requires a lot of customer service on the job. Management wasn't the best as they were very young and didn't have the slightest clue on how to motivate their sales team, if anything they made me not want to sell"
good,"Duties to follow"
good,Enjoyed working on customer computers and solved hardware and software problems. The complex workload helped advance my knowledge of computers and how to solve common and more uncommon problems. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
good,"BestBuy was an extremely fun job. I mean you get to go around and talk to about about them selves and figure out what would best suit their needs and 9 times out 10 they would listen. My co-workers were some of the best co-workers I've had at any of my jobs. Not to mention since there are so many people working there if you need a day off for something important management was normally able to get you that day off. Sadly my only real complaint about BestBuy is the management. It seemed as though to me no matter how good of a salesmen you were or how hard you tried and if you did everything they asked of you, it seemed as though it was never enough. They would always find something to fix in you. You never really got noticed for doing anything good, only bad. Management only cared about the people who could sell regardless if they were a horrible person or did things they weren't suppose to do."
good,"A typical day at work was okay, which all we ever did was calls to other retail stores across the country. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with putty."
good,great co-workers helps pass the time and helps learn new things discussing new tech and better methods to overcome certain tech related issues.
good,"I generally enjoyed working at Best Buy for the time that I was there. The management was fair, but needed some improvements. I learned a lot about the products and the logistics of running a warehouse. My co-workers were awesome, except one downfall of the job was having to pick up the slack that certain ones left behind. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays it is very hectic, you work A LOT of hours and it is very exhausting. Overall having the freedom to pretty much manage your own day was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The job itself is fun!  Always being pushed to perform higher than competitive companies, for the same wages (or lower) is not so fun.  I do believe that each and every person of the team that I work with deserves more than a $9.50 starting wage, as the deal with difficult customers day in and day out.  Whoever said ""The customer is always right,"" has obviously NEVER worked in customer service.  But you take each day with a grain of salt and laugh at it afterwards with fellow workers who understand your woes, and that is the best part of the job!"
good,"Best Buy has a rather large Management team.  Between supervisors, the GM, team leads, and assistant managers, there was only two in leadership who were respected by the staff.  The other managers were not approachable, rude, and they caused many employees to quit.  The turn over rate was not the best.."
good,"This position felt monotonous at times. Every day I made the same sales pitch to dozens of people. The product might change a little bit when the manufacturers would include a new feature on the newest model of computer, but otherwise I said the same thing day in and day out."
good,"I would introduce customers that wanted or needed a computer to our selection in the store.  After hearing what they needed, I would go to recommend a product along with accessories that was their complete solution.  I learned a great deal about computers, but the most important skill I learned was in sales.  Being able to effectively communicate with anyone who had a question about computers was an extremely important part of the job.  I could count on some of my management to back me up about the hard parts of the job, but sometimes I would feel like I'm hung out to dry. My co-workers were not the most motivated group - thus, the hardest part of the job was staying motivated.  Without a cohesive group that was supportive and empowering to make working there easier, my motivation to show up every day was tested.  I enjoyed meeting quite a few different people and learning about what they were using their computers for. I've heard of some crazy software that some of them use, which I find totally fascinating."
good,"Best Buy was a fun, upbeat place to work that also sells things you yourself are interested in buying which made selling and having interest in the products you sell easier."
good,"Dar una calida bienvenida a todos los Clientes que se presentaran."
good,"Process Returns and Pick ups, sometimes having to deal with complex situations. Also learning about different products in the store to deliver perfect customer service."
good,Over all this is a good job and great team members to work with and for. Scheduling was always great and flexible. family friendly employer.
good,"I loved my job at Best Buy, however, management and functionality as a business is a joke. The pay is low, they didn't schedule efficiently, no benefits for part-time."
good,Fun Company to work for. Great for college students. Retail hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with technology and interested customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Work assisting customers with technological solutions.  Evaluate and understand their needs, and recommend a product or steps needed to solve their problems."
good,"Fast pace environment where i had to constantly train associates. I was able to have fun with my employees while being productive. I learned how to manage the store as if it was my own business from the financial, employee, and customer aspects. I enjoyed always meeting new people and helping develop a solution that fit their needs. As assistant manager i was always working without having much time for myself."
good,like working here. but moving up in this company is hard. job culture if okay very easy going environment some well educated workers. it does need some work. better work ethnic in this company. better compensation is needed. as well have more vacation better benefits overall.
good,I enjoy working at best buy it is a fun and fast pace working environment. My co-workers are helpful and have taught me so much.
good,All about numbers. I love most of the people that I work with. It can be a very fun place to work. They do well with working with your schedule. Most of the time the customers that come in are awesome and make working a lot of fun.
good,Learned the correct way of dealing with stressful and difficult situations. A typical day for me consists of usually seamless returns with the exception of needing a manager for customer satisfaction. Coworkers are usually willing to help.
good,"I am a cashier, usually 5 hour shifts . co workers are great. learned to be a better listener . management is bearable, hardest part about the job is the angry customers"
good,"I was a temp to hire and I did my very best to be one of the other temp to hires that actually got hired full time. Sadly when the holiday season was over my hours were cut down to nothing. A couple others were in the same situation. "
good,"a typical day at work would answering phones, closing out online orders, creating order, etc. Each day I learned how to use the new system since recently they upgraded. May supervisor was really good and help full. The hardest part of the job was when you would get that one customer that was unhappy about everything, but you just have to keep a good smile and help them the best you could. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would be able to help with Truck and do inventory with my co-workers."
good,Working with many different varieties of customers on a daily basis High Paced environment and was easy for advancement. On a Daily Basis found my self looking after many of the different forms of the business having it be Margin analysis and Sales Budgets
good,"Very interesting place to work, Can be different at times but its the usual routine like in many retail jobs. Can be good at first but sometimes the environment changes and becomes a workplace where It might be bad or not be so bad. You will meet many people and your co-workers can be very friendly or not."
good,"I loved the job in the sense that helping people everyday was enjoyable, especially elderly folks, they are always so kind and appreciative of any information. The discount was also really nice, but I would personally rather have cheap and decent health,dental,vision etc. "
good,"I enjoy working for Best Buy.  I have been with them for 10 years now and I am only looking to leave because my jobe requires travel 75% of the year.  Now that I have a family, its time to find a job working at home."
good,"It is a good company, especially if you are in school and are looking for a part time job. the management is decent and it is easy to move up in the company because they are always looking for people"
good,I enjoyed my time at best buy. I was on the Geek Squad and truthfully I was surprised when I found out that geek squad made the same as all the other areas in the store. Which is minimum wage.
good,"Typical day at work can be either balanced between busy and very busy you are always on your feet and ready at all times for oncoming situations."
good,"There's no avoiding the part where this is a retail job -- fluctuating hours, crabby customers, unrealistic expectations sent from on high, etc. -- but the company does at least make efforts to engage with its employees and re-tool its offerings to maintain a competitive advantage over most big box stores."
good,Fun work environment from top to bottom. Good opportunity to move up if you are interested. Great experience and knowledge gained working here.  An opportunity to enhance your skills.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I enjoyed teaching customers how to use new technology to improve their quality of life. I loved being the assistant manager and helping others improve skills and achieve their goals. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of all the new policy changes coming down from corporate and having to disappoint customers when we can't offer the same things we did in the past. I did however love working with new gadgets and technology and was very enthusiastic about them when demonstrating products to customers.
good,i volunteered at best buy for an ROP marketing/retail class that i has attended my senior year at north vista high school located in riverside.
good,"Its a fun place to work, The management team is very friendly and down to earth. I enjoy the work I do, But the pay could be better and Hard to move up."
good,"Good job for college students, but not if you have to support a family. Discount is great, but supervisor are unable to supervise without micro management."
good,"It's retail; what needs to be said?"
good,"On a typical day I would be in a car installing new equipment or troubleshooting previously installed products. On slow days I try to sell to customers or train my co-workers on car installation products and selling techniques. I have learned how to use a DMM, how to troubleshoot better. The management is pretty good most days but, sometimes you end up feeling like you are not part of a team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the downtime. I love the expressions I get from my client's when I demo their new equipment for them."
good,"This was a job that worked on making sure everyone was on pace with all the new tech that was coming out daily.  It was great.  The people, the product is a nerd or tech junky paradise.  Always good people to work with.  Mostly part time positions.  Hard to get Full time.  Management was never very useful.  They were the number monkeys, always worried about how the they looked on paper, never really about moral, or employee atmosphere.  However the employee discount allows one to look past these little things."
good,"Best Buy was, or maybe still is, one of the most successful electronic retailers. Without Best Buy, I never would have began developing my customer service skills. Management at Best Buy was average, depending on the department. Understanding of the hierarchy and respect was essential."
good,"Typically it's pretty relaxed in my department, with the occasional rush.  Overall it's nice to connect customers with the devices and solutions they need.  Otherwise there isn't much room for advancement locally, though there is opportunity for relocation."
good,"It's hardly ever a dull day at Best Buy because there are always people there. The management at my particular locations is, eh. They can be very unprofessional at times. They do however, show a lot of attention to those considering moving up in the company and they do what they can to help. The hardest part is not making enough money. The most enjoyable part is the work/life balance."
good,"I learned  a few things in the company, Such as Printing Merchandise Price Tag , Stocking ,  Assisting Customer with any needs. Worked Hard Stayed Focus on the task that was given to me.The Fun Part  was helping  customers deliver their merchandise out in front then receiving a tip after. "
good,Great place to work for those interested in a fact paced retail environment with wonderful benefits for both part and full time.
good,I was a cashier and worked the front lanes mostly at Best Buy. Checking out customers products and also offering them additional protection on certain items.
good,"Every day starts with a unity meeting with games and quizzes. The staff is very friendly and helps each other wherever possible. "
good,"Job was easy, not very challenging. Daily routines is to provide technical support for end users. I would say that with the company for many years management is unstable at certain point."
good,"Ok pay. Discount is nice if you get the hours to earn enough money to use it."
good,"A great company to work for to gain experience for future jobs outside of Best Buy. In your store are great people, but beyond that, corporate isn't particular on taking care of the ""little"" guy."
good,"My experience at Best Buy was a relatively positive one.  While there was a definitely emphasis on meeting metrics, the company as a whole seemed to value its employees and days were usually very positive with a lot of working together and joking around when we needed it to keep up morale.  Employees helped one another and management gave us enough leeway to enjoy ourselves and attack problems and situations on our own in our own ways.  Performance was valued and management felt it was more cost effective to keep employees around and learning rather than firing and hiring whenever someone didn't do well.  The hardest part for me was dealing with varying views from different managers on what was allowed and what was not.  The leeway previously mentioned also went for the managers on which rules they chose to emphasize and which ones were trivial."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day a work consists of helping people find things, making sure they got the help they needed and giving them a last impression of good service for them to hopefully come back to shop at our store. I have learned how to work in many different parts of the store, customer service, front lanes, store pick-up, computers and tablets. My manager is amazing. He helps out when needed. He also gives us recognition when we do well. My co-workers are the best I have worked with so far. They are all like family. The hardest part of the job is standing there for a long period of time (hours at a time). The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all kinds of different people and helping them on a daily basis."
good,"Employee discount was awesome, and the job was relatively stress free.  Had a few rough days, but overall, a pretty cool place to work.  Pay sucked"
good,"My typical day at that job was communicating with customers and making technology fun. I have worked at that company for years and in many different departments."
good,A great place to work while in school or career searching. Discounts are great and with the right manager working can be fun. I would say Best Buy is a good starter job.
good,"I used to love to come to work. Now its just a job, it could still be a great place if the people that run the individual stores  and the higher ups see that the people who work for you make the store. Its the knowledge the customer comes for not just the product. I feel its not fun anymore and they are not looking out for the employees. A lot of people have left that loved the company for years."
good,"Best Buy's policies mainly focus towards the customers which is great, going ""Blue"" was a good move as a company. Treatment of employees still need to be worked on. It is not a horrible place to work, I actually enjoy going to work only when specific people are there. Managers are sometimes very pushy with sales goals and seems to be all they care about. Sometimes will push new products down customer's throat even though they express no interest. Co-Workers are great and I totally enjoy being around them."
good,The best part of this job was the people. My coworkers were amazing. We always had fun completing daily tasks with some friendly competition over sales goals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers who didn't understand the technology and helping them understand it.
good,"I held more than one position at Best Buy. The pay is the worst part about the job. If you can get into a department where you are passionate and have some knowledge about, selling will come easy."
good,"Though I enjoy the services provided by the Best Buy corporation, working for them is less enjoyable. Though the benefits of being an employee are excellent, the work ranges from hectic all week to non existent. Hours are early and long (for an inventory associate) and pay is slightly above minimum wage. The management and other workers are agreeable and friendly, but work schedules are inconsistent and grueling (in my experience). Best Buy is a fine place to find a college job, however, and does offer excellent employee benefits. If you don't mind hectic hours and low pay, Best Buy is a fairly decent job to hold for a part time employee."
good,Best Buy is great company to work for. I have learned a lot from this company that will last me a lifetime. Best buy has changed over the years but always with the best intentions for its employees and the shareholders.
good,"I did this job during the Christmas holiday in my grade 12 year. My job was to put stuff on to the shelves and keep them tidy and filled. My general manager is a good guy, funny and always feels like he listens to us. My direct supervisor is a little more apathetic though. Not terrible person, does her job well, but not someone I feel who does not see a problem. "
good,"In an industry that is ever changing, Best Buy is a leader in consumer electronics. In my tenure there, I have learned everything from Home Theater to Computers to Appliances. The product knowledge alone has been a wealth."
good,"My time at Best Buy was a very challenging and rewarding experience."
good,Best Buy was a decent experience being that I was able to balance life as a full time student and life as a Best Buy employee.  The hardest part about the job was balancing my work schedule along with my school schedule because Best Buy is a very demanding company.
good,"Great Culture and people to work with."
good,"It was structured for low skill set employees, and not focused advancing ideal candidates. Lost in the bureaucracy many good employees would leave. Overtime the company got less structured, and more difficult to advance in."
good,"My biggest complaint is the lack of communication between managers, supervisors, and the actual sales consultants. Training is basically figure it out on your own. The employee discount is great, and pay is okay, but hours aren't set (unless you're a lucky full-timer)."
good,Receive drop shipments from UPS and FedEx. Unload and load the truck. Have an amazing management team. My co-workers are a good team.
good,Worked with Best Buy mobile and attempted to sell both cellular phones and plans.  Answered questions about cellular devices and also assisted the rest of the Best Buy store with any help needed.  Management was always upbeat and happy to be at work.  They help with any problems throughout the store and are always understanding of life outside of work.  The compensation for the sales associate is priced well for that position but without promoting is not a career.  Promoting is an option within the company and would be a good place to work.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy was a very challenging work place. managment was not very involved with employees and not enough hours were giving. The best part about best buy were my co workers and great discount on certain electronics.
good,"A first the job was very customer oriented and management were determined to make sure that employees were trained properly. Management was usually occupied or never to be found to deal with customer issues. Also the training now focuses on selling customers items or services that they may not require at all, rather than selling them what they actually need. "
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you love talking to people and helping them set up their house with gadgets and gizmos. healthcare is great, coworkers are your best tool to helping someone if you are not sure how to help them."
good,Management is great! Some rudes customers but thats typical. High turn over not enough people to cover shifts.
good,Overwhelming and poor management I work hard at my job everyday I do extra work to make sure everything on my team runs well. The Job is a lot but not more than I can handle. Management is my biggest problem with this job if it wasn't for management then I would love my job again like I used to when I first started
good,"Explain to customers the way a product works."
good,"Ensured customer satisfaction with products, whether cameras or computers and their accessories."
good,The past seven years have been a tremendous learning experience. I have gotten to travel and see the country and have even been abroad deploying multiple projects in various markets. Having the opportunity to work with folks from around the country has been a privilege and I am thankful for it.
good,"Typical day at work opening: Open, check last nights deposit, morning paperwork, stock counts, and prepare to open store. Sell."
good,"A typical day a work includes helping incoming customers who are trying to keep up with the latest technology in phones, tablets and hotspots. In this opportunity i got to learn how to demonstrate different divides and how to help save some money for customers. The management team was very knowledgable in any questions customers had. The hardest part of going to work was knowing that advancements in positions and in rates were harshly determined. I mostly enjoyed meeting new people and providing the necessary tools they needed to complete there everyday life."
good,Some times the employees were amazing but more often than not but during the holidays many employees that were brought in were in-mature and difficult to work with. Managers do not care about there employees development and unless your friends with leadership no promotions will ever be available.
good,A different job every day.  Some days I would be in 2-4 different departments.  Never a dull day.  Always kept busy even with no air in the summer and low heat in winter.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work to learn some valuable skills such as: Communication with a customer that wasn't satisfied and turning them into a satisfied customer, Learning new computer skills as I worked closely with new products everyday, and taking on a leadership role"
good,"a Typical day at work would consist of sorting televisions in the warehouse, making sure online orders were being processed and managed, assisting customers with putting purchased televisions into their vehicle,Shipping out online orders (Ship-to-Home), Preparing totes of Damagedand returned product to be shipped out,and closing duties(lock up of trailer doors and expensive product in warehouse. The manage has varied since working there. there have been really good managers and really bad ones. warehouse co-workers are the hardest working people in the store aside from a few that represent the sales floor. HArdest part of the job would be managing different tasks when your by yourself in warehouse. it is a very demanding job. The most enjoyable part of the job is maintaining  your warehouse when things are getting difficult"
good,The atmosphere of the business was good because the customers made it that way. Most of the time you were being compared to other associates who have been with the company for awhile based on your performance. It was challenging to deal with management and customers because every transaction was different even the customers were buying the same two products! talk about inconsistent. the hardest part about the job was to many chiefs and not enough indians
good,"Just a retail supervisor job with the advantage to work with computers and perform repairs. Management is always ""Driving results"" in the form of taking your labor to work on the sales floor."
good,always fun with good co workers.  the easiest part of the job is just joking around & the hardest was getting swarmed by customers
good,"I love working with people and helping them find the right product and solution for them. Best Buy is a wonderful place to accomplish that. At times however, workers and management take advantage of relaxed enforcement of rules."
good,"The overall morale is not as uplifting as it use to be...seems as though current management are not always on the same page, which sometimes confuses employees"
good,"Work on relationships with Small, mid, and large based companies to provide technology."
good,Great place to work. The company will provide you the proper training.
good,In selling electronics you are introduced to many technical details of the products and services being sold and the information is extremely useful in day to day life outside of work. The initial job atmosphere inside a Best Buy store is exciting and fun. Once fully trained however the environment becomes one filled with unrealistic expectations and consistent bombardment from upper store and district management. Essentially an employee is made to feel that they are easily replaced and not important to the business as a whole. An employee has a sense of annoyance almost immediately and quickly loses all interest in being an effective team member.
good,Help customers with questions regarding technology. Inventory would merchandise products early in the morning and head out to the floor to assist customers.
good,A good place to work but the money isn't that great and you dont work off commission. It is a very stressful environment with customer service and satisfying the customer.
good,"Wonderful job. People are friendly, management is very nice and overall great work environment."
good,"Good work life balance, pays decent at corporate level. "
good,"Company always pushes you to do more. They are always coming up with ways to improve productivity. I may not agree with many of the policies due to the logic behind it, but the company does try to train you for handling each policy. Depending on store, management can be great or a total nightmare, but that is no different from any other retail store. Since I work within Geeksquad the hardest part of the job is combining sales with IT. As a technician who cares about his clients its hard to sell clients stuff they may not even need. That is the concept behind Bestbuy, it has a very vigorous sales plan. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the different technology that is in production on a daily basis."
good,enjoyed my time working in the geek squad..just not enough pay compensation after receiving gold starts for customer service
good,"It's a decent job but it gets annoying over time. The discount is great, but there are stressful times when you have hundreds of people in your department all demanding help at the same time."
good,"I loved working for Best Buy, and the company itself takes amazing care of its employees. However, depending on who you are working directly under, regardless of your work ethic or passion/drive it can be extremely difficult to advance or be recognized within your career path. Company = awesome. Some of the people working there = not so awesome."
good,"It's a fun place to work but the pay is not very good. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping to lead customers to a good technological purchase and having fun with co-workers. The motto at Best Buy is really good. ""Have fun while being the best."" We do get to do that but I just need to make more money."
good,It was a good play to work at in till they started laying off managers. Which meant the managers who were left had more to deal with. So they are more over whelmed. Most work days are fun it just depends in everyone's mood that day. My co-workers love them. There isn't a hard part about this job. I enjoy meeting new people. Its amazing how many cultures and languages you come across by just being a cashier.
good,"I learned a lot about sales and customer service at Best Buy. it was a great learning experience, that I reflect on often."
good,"Good coworkers however not so good supervisors.  Yelled at for unnecessary things and reprimanded for things that others did, regardless of proof.  Ridden by managers to hurry up when there is no faster and occasionally way too strict on regular procedures."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work especially if it's your first job or just something you want to do part time while finishing school. It's a good job to learn the ins and out of the sales floor and if desired there are oppurtunities to grow with the company and advance into management. I was recently laid off during a big company reconstruction, and I would assume there may be more changes in the future."
good,I don't really have much to say about it I have been doing it for so long. t is just the norm.
good,"good place to start and get experience, but youre not gonna get much farther than that."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This job taught me that no matter how great the job is if the place is run incorrectly then that can make the whole experience bad.
good,"Was fun in the beginning when the right management team was in place but as time progressed communication was overlooked.  Nepitism in the work place, you had to be friendly with certain management leaders to move up in the work place."
good,Structure is changing. Layoffs are being made. More responsibility is being placed on management remaining. Leading to lack of complete understanding in all departments.
good,"A lot of expectations, little training, pay can be decent. Don't have to know much information about the products. Sped most of your time coaching employees."
good,"A typical day of work consists of aiding customers with their purchases of home theater electronics, ensuring they get all that they need for the experience they desire."
good,I worked as a temporary employee with the promise of becoming permanent and getting more hours and they kept me at 5 hours a week and never made me permanent... Good place to work a lot of great people to work with and I do not know how management at other stores would be but I will assume better than mine.
good,"This would be a great place to work if they were able to take care of their employees properly. The fact that we had to have no experience to become loss prevention associates, and they did no such training in prior to sending us to man the cameras and doors was a huge disadvantage."
good,Geek Squad is a great stepping stone to start in the IT field. You get to deal with customers and at the same time do what everyone in this field loves to do is work on computers. We have a very simple process of checking units into our system and then we start fixing them. Most all software issues are taken care of in house and most physical repairs are sent to our service center. We use proprietary repair tools that help us fix the computers in store.
good,"Best Buy was a Great Company to work for . I learned a lot about Leadership, People Development and how to run a successful business."
good,I've learned a lot about how things run in a company while working at Best Buy. I'm an observant person so I quickly picked up the work habits at Best Buy. The hardest part about working at Best Buy is going to have to be when the computers have issues; it makes things a tad slower. Aside from that it was a great place to start working. Very fast paced so I immediately loved it.
good,"New General manager was great. Co-workers made the environment tolerable. They used to play music throughout the store (no longer do). There wasn't a whole lot of OJT, most training was computer based e-learnings. Management wasn't supportive. Most were unsupportive or standoff-ish. My personal supervisor was amazing, and tried to have an upbeat persona and work environment. His leadership mixed with a few great co-workers made the day passable with a smile. If management were to improve, it would be a great place to work, however it continues to decline country-wide. Same issues i faced on the east coast, an associate of mine deals with the same issuse's on the west coast."
good,"Management at my store severely lack a strong and direct line of management. It was inevitable to step on each other's feet, and keep all of our clients satisfied. I have learned an immeasurable amount of skills from this job, but there is a whole lot of improvement that is necessary."
good,Pay isn't much and good luck getting a promotion if youre not into brown nosing and kissing up.  Besides its a nice place to work.
good,Turbulent but they are not afraid to change. Good work/life balance and open to try new things.
good,Best Buy does pay better than minimum wage and does care about the happiness of the employees.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"BestBuy est une bonne place pour apprendre la vente consiste en quoi, car du faits qu'il n'y est pas de commission, il n'y a pas de pression n'y d'objectif requis, donc pas de pression. Par contre, l'inconvénient est lorsque ton expérience est acquis il n'y a pas de récompense porter aux efforts mis dans le travail, comme par exemple une commission ou bonus."
good,"My experience with Best Buy was very career-building. I learned many useful skills that I can use at any other job. Though I was hard-working, which led to my quick move up to a Supervisory position, many other employees are simply just there for the paycheck. This could make morale a little dull and unmotivated. Management can be lazy at times and almost as if they're trying to avoid any dissatisfied customers. I personally was burnt out with my job from management piling responsibilities on me that were not within my job description."
good,"position was seasonal, wasn't much room for advancement.  I wish i could have stayed longer"
good,"Best Buy is a great retail job, and compensation is better than most. However, the company is constantly re-structuring, and we never know id our job is on the line."
good,"Overall, it was a decent job, I simply wasn't into the culture of pure profit. I was also just a teenager with no real work experience which sometimes showed through. Management was good, willing to work with you. A typical day consisted of printing out new price tags and reorganizing product. Also helped customers."
good,As warehouse more often than not I would be arriving to work earlier than the front of store staff to maintain displays or to put out or organize product that had arrived in trucks that day or the night before.
good,I have always liked my job at Best Buy and have liked the managers that we have there.  I learned a lot about the selling process.  I have grown tired of the repetitiveness of selling electronics.
good,"A typical day at work was fun the employees was nice. Management was ok, the most enjoyable part was helping the customers. I learned how to listen to details to better help customers."
good,"A challenging place to work with a great corporate culture."
good,"I worked at Best Buy as a part time tablet sales consultant, and I really enjoyed it. It was my first sales job and I named managed to become on of the top sales guys in the district, which I was really happy with. Sadly,  management failed to tell me that using a credit card with someone else's name on with your employee discount is a fireable offense, though the card was a joint account. So, rather than giving me another chance, they just fired me and that was that. I've now moved on to much bigger things now."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to start a corporate career. There is a lot to learn about both internal and external merchandising, supply-chain, and people management. After 2-3 years, it might be time to find something different. Moving into a management role is a long and overdrawn process."
good,Your days will never be boring. You will meet new people everyday and see new places while your on the road. You will also learn from some of the best installers out there.
good,"The people I work for are very knowledgeable; friendly and have dedication to serving or helping those who need the right answer. Having those who have common interest does bring out the best in people with different view."
good,"Best Buy has been only of the major Electronic Retail Stores in the US."
good,good company to work for. multiple oppurtunites to advance as well as create a stable work enviorment.
good,"Great place to come to work, do your job and leave when you're off. Pay could be a little better but not too stressful"
good,"Advancement nearly impossible. Co-workers are nice, Great cafeteria, management is a little lackluster."
good,This job gave me an opportunity to enact with individual that had great ideal and we work togather to accomplish our goals. My role as a leader also was greatly enhance by the opportunities I was give to open new stores for this company.
good,Fun place to work especially if you are into technology however as with most retail jobs the pay is less than desirable unless you are in a managerial position.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Pay is low, managers micromanage. Patrons of Best Buy are educated consumers and they make the experience plausible. For under producing stores, the employees have to be able to work well under pressure."
good,"great job, warehouse work was fun also customer service was nice, you get to educate people with technology knowledge"
good,Most of the people are great to work with. However the management is very into politics and do not always look at qualifications and performance when promoting.
good,love working at best buy and a very nice discount. not a flexible work times and poor hourly pay.
good,"The job is not horrible, but as a sales associate you are expected to up sell and sell/mention all associate attachments. They make you carry around a sheet with a list of questions that you have to fill out. If you don't they badger you about it or write you up. Lastly, you can make a great sale, such as up sell the hell out of it, add all attachments, and get a Best Buy credit app, and they will still tell you what you did wrong and how you could have done better."
good,"I've been with the company for a few years. Your experience will likely depend on the success of your store, and the people you work with. General managers and leadership will greatly affect how well your store does, and what type of bonus (if any) you receive. The company will allow you to move to different positions if you have interest and are willing to put the time in for training. These position changes will usually be later, and moving up out of a store position will be nearly impossible unless you live in MN and can apply for internships. Even with leadership support and living close to MN, I couldn't get past the application stage of an internship. Expect to have numbers constantly repeated to you, and to be held accountable if you do not reach your goals. Otherwise, the job will be like any other retail job."
good,"Large organization that offers opportunity to move into different areas and learn new businesses and capabilities.  Challenging work, empowerment by management and important and interesting projects and launches.   Good work/life balance.  Located conveniently on a campus with many amenities, including daycare, on-site fitness center, bank, convenience store, post office, dmv services and coffee shop."
good,"Everyday it is about the same, declining margin and meeting comp. Typical day at work is solving problems for people or simply asking questions. Sometimes they can become technical depending on the matter at hand. You have to be familiar with all of your product and 100% confident in your answers, because of all the other bad experiences a customer had with a new associate or just overall experience."
good,"My direct manager was pretty great. He could be a pretty hard guy sometimes, but he really motivated me and I learned a lot. That's about the only good thing I took away from working for Geek Squad/Best Buy. This company is going to hell in a hand-basket and if they want to plug the hole in their sinking ship they need to completely re-assess their turnover times, protection plans, and work force because the customers were NOT happy."
good,BestBuy outsourced many of their positions to Accenture which in turn eventually outsourced their positions to India companys
good,"This has a great atmosphere. People are professional, smart, and mature. However, this is not the place to go if you value job security. The company seems to cut valuable staff but keep less valuable managers who are making poor choices for being competitive in a growing online marketplace."
good,"Huge sales quotas, but if quota is met, bonus is nice (within Best Buy Mobile), cool environment and coworkers. Most managers are cool, but I quit due to a very rude manager. He lost a long time employee who did an above-and-beyond job each day."
good,Sales and commission culture without the benefits of commission.
good,"Best Buy was great with one exception. Management was in a transitional period during the middle of my time there and the transition wasn't smooth. Managers were cold, demanding, and unappreciative of my and my coworkers' work."
good,"In my opinion most of the Geek Squad services are over priced for what they are or for what they cover. "
good,"expect an important part of you job to change every month. and for you to be held accountable to change at the drop of a dime. It was based off of a military regiment, but even the military tests out changes before they actually apply them to the lives of soldiers. geek squad does not."
good,"As a member of the sales support team, our main duties were processing the truck, and assisting sales associates and customers on the floor."
good,You provide customer service to clients who are having trouble with their electronic devices. The work environment is laid back with access to computers and x box on break. The most enjoyable part is helping the client resolve their issue and making them happy. 
good,"Provide customer service, handle cash,credit, debit, check, etc transactions. Cleaned store daily."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best buy mobile was a good place to sharpen my skills but the mangers lack of leading skills not all of best buy but atleast where i was working at the program there are running is very sharp .
good,It does not matter what area you work in for this company it is all about sales metrics.
good,"Honestly it was a very good experience in the first couple of years, now ive grown to dislike working for best buy"
good,working at best buy can be stressful as numbers are all that matter. i will say the individuals thqt work at the stores though can become some of the best people you will ever know.
good,"Great people and culture, a bit chaotic and unstructured but lots to offer"
good,"Usually a relaxing day involving a lot of customer contact, but if the numbers are a little bit low the nagging begins from your supervisors and it gets to the point that you have to sacrifice customer service and quality just to get them to the register and get to the next one. The nagging gets too far especially when they're contacting you out of the work place even though its a simple part time high school job for most."
good,"A typical work day involves helping customers with their needs, while maintaining a clean and organized workplace. Daily routines have constantly changed over the past three years of work, but the one thing that has always stayed constant is that the customer comes first. Management has become more interactive with the employees, giving feedback and coaching on a daily basis. My team members are just that, team players always willing to share the workload and do what is necessary to make sure things get done. The hardest part of the job for me originally was learning to get to know the customers and accommodate their needs, but after perfecting the art of doing so, I'd say now the most difficult part of the job is having team members transfer to other locations or jobs as we have all become a close knit family."
good,"Nice place to work, I definitely stepped out of my own shadow while being there. If you didn't know something that was never an acceptable answer with all types of people counting on you from the president of the company right down to each and every last customer and employee. "
good,Location does not follow fully follow company changes made over year ago. Store manager sometimes seems to be clueless on issue's with store and why things happen for example turnover within employees and leadership. Also sometimes seems to know it all when it is apparent  that he is unsure what he is even talking about.
good,Great part-time job if you are not easily frustrated with customers.
good,Before major leadership changes I was pretty happy with the way things were. However after the shake up I would say morale has dropped. The 5 pay changes(pay cuts) in the last 5 years did not help either.
good,I have been their for 3 years and things changed alot. I dont totally agree with the new USOM or new bonus structure.
good,"A typical day of workin is learning of new changes and adapting, then doing daily routine."
good,"The years that I have had with this company have been great. I have had the opportunity to learn and grow in many ways. The people in the store have become an extended family. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with angry customers. However, those customers have helped me become better at resolving issues."
good,Large retail that needs some adjustments
good,Assisting customers.
good,"I had years in with this company and worked just about every position available. Working with customers was great, however, the management and corporate environment was not the best to work in. There was no consistency in management, constantly changing. Corporate was implementing new policies just about everyday. For the hours worked and the time I put in with the company, I was not treated or compensated very well, and therefore I left the company."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy was centered on building relationships with customers, to create a sense of community, and performing transactions. These two tasks complimented each other. Together they provided opportunities for me to add warranties, services, and accessories; things that were necessary for the intended usage of the product. Working at Best buy I learned that the customers are always right and there is almost always a way to accommodate them. I learn that trust and sincerity is essential in relationship building as well as a good foundation that drives business."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Typical day requires me checking in with store leaders finding out the productivity of the day. Also checking and responding to emails afterwards performing day-to-day tasking such as cleaning, pricing and downstocking product while performing customer service. Customers always come first while performing tasking."
good,"Most of my job as a seasonal worker was to unload inventory, pull orders, and monitor the security system"
good,Company was great at first to work for. Dealing with favoritism and inappropriate relationships between upper management and store level employees became too much to bear. Enjoyed my time there but very few regrets about leaving.
good,"work on reports and people coming to me for help. Nice environment at the workplace, everyone is helpful and great to work with."
good,"working at best buy was fun, they were really flexible with the work schedule. well balanced for a person going to school. we did a lot of monthly training which were good and helped us keep up to date with latest technologies."
good,"Geek Squad Culture is something truly amazing and I can relate to it. However, having been with Geek Squad for 5 years and Best Buy slightly longer I have come to realize how much Geek Squad is being held back by a failing company like Best Buy. I do enjoy working for the Geek Squad and am proud to tell people I work for Geek Squad, but truth be told I am not proud to work for Best Buy."
good,Management was flexible with my school schedule. I worked as an inventory specialist. I shipped and recievd product for the store.
good,The best thing about working with this company is that you can be yourself and still reach a level of success. The motto is have fun while being the best and for most of my time with the company that has held true.
good,"my time with Best buy was one of my greatest experiences. Ive learned many positions in the store which may have prepared me for a greater journey. Management sometimes can be a bit non helpful. mostly scripted,"
good,"fun place, except black friday, mandatory work weekends and scheduleing needs"
good,"Best Buy is great place if you make it that way. Things are changing rapidly in the company, but in a great way. My time with Best Buy has been great at times, and like other jobs bad at times. But at the end of the day it was still a job, and still paid well enough."
good,I starte as a sales associate and was promoted several times very fast...Great achievement recognition.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is very hectic, you now have to work every dept. as opposed to just working the dept. you were trained in, so your'e not too comfortable with everything. I've learned to manage my time, to communicate well with customers, to sell high priced products. My co workers are hard working and help out a lot. The hardest part of the job is to help everyone when you are not sure about other depts."
good,"I am the lead in the Digital Imaging department. Everything that has to do with cameras, camcorders, DSLRs, compact system cameras, and digital frames and the processing systems of the cameras I am in charge of. In this position you need to be ready and willing to train people on the spot as well and communicate with everyone the goals which you have in place."
good,The company has given me great opportunity to learn and grow from a grass roots level.
good,it's constantly busy and the hardest part of the job is trying to reach the set goals for the day.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers. You learn everything there is to know about technology and all the producs Best Buy has to offer, along with all the upsells on the warranties they offer. This is a place where you will be micro-managed and have to report to several different bosses. However, this also gives Best Buy the advantage of promoting people from within. The hardest part of the job is just getting used to the environment, learning the technology and devices, and selling the warranties. Most enjoyable part is that it is a some-what relaxed environment with friendly co-workers."
good,Company with a great desire to teach their people. Politics can come into play int he workplace which is my biggest complaint
good,"Supervised a team of up to twelve cashiers and customer service representatives. Responsible for balancing cash drawers, preparing nightly deposits and reconciling monthly reports. Resolved customer service issues in a timely manner."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Bestbuy is a great company to work for! Typical day at work consiste of putting loads of product out yet try to manage to help customers. Taken from one department I another( lack of coverage). Hardest part was being frustrated because of situation in the environment. Best part would be the satisfaction from helpin people and having them come back looking for you!!
good,"Just as any other job there were many issues, but despite the problems I enjoyed working for a company that I was able to show my strengths in customer service. I processed all returns, exchanges, and product ring outs for customers. To me there was never a hard part. I learned that you can have fun while being the BEST!"
good,Best Buy mobile is great when you are just starting to get into the work force while you are going to school. It has very flexible hours and teaches you how to interact with your coworkers through team building. I have gained excellent customer service skills that have enabled me to handle various customer inquiries. By being a customer specialist at Best Buy I have learned how to determine which products and services are compatible with different customers by using sales strategy's in order to provide them with customer satisfaction. What I enjoy most is being able to work in a fast paced environment with coworkers that motivate each other and have a understanding of one another.
good,"I was only seasonal, but it felt as if I was much more than that. We worked daily as a group to help customers, if someone didn't know, they would pass to the next someone who did, and that's how we operated. Everyone had a gift, and we brought our gifts together to get the job done. Management was fine and kept with the times so we were able to talk about anything. There were not many hard times, even when the store was packed. I enjoyed everything."
good,"typical day colud be anything from stocking to asset protection to selling on the floor, all my co-workers were pretty entertaining"
good,"It is a selling environment, and sales goals a pushed very hard. Pay is decent, but varies drastically through positions."
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time at Best Buy but due to a company restructure I was laid off, hence the low score on Job security for me."
good,* Conduct/Lead team meeting before opening.
good,best buy overall was a great company to work for. good values for the company and a great learning experience.
good,"It was fun working at for the company, employee discounts where great. Staff was very helpful and work as a team."
good,"I've worked for this company about 5 years now. It is centered around the customer being given the best service you can give. Offering the best solution to fit the need of the customer. You learn a lot about the products and we do role-playing to help ourselves with presentations to the customer. The hardest part is dealing with what is relevant to the customer standing in front of you and what the company needs. Sometimes in most people, the need of the company tends to out-way the needs of the customer. So, we have to find a way to not make mindless offers that make us the ""person to avoid"" when they come back into the store. I try to find relevancy in my offers to customers to land there needs. I love the customer interaction. So many different personalities and so many ways to help."
good,Great workplace.
good,The customer focus work environment with daily goal and expectations for associate to reach. Overall it is what you expect from a retail box location.
good,I only worked the holiday season as a temp but it is a job where you need to learn the products on your own
good,I had some very mixed experiences with this company most I would say was good but sometimes the negative experiences out weighed the good.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company until the last 5 months. There was no room for advancement after they restructured their stores and the way they started to treat the employees and customers made for a very callused and degrading work environment. I learned a lot from this company, but I would never work for them again."
good,"I've worked for Best Buy for nearly 5 years, I've experienced a lot of change with the company in that time. They invested a lot in my training and career development, however, it is not true for every location."
good,Great place to learn the fundamentals of technologies. Managers are very passionate about their jobs. Also working with customers directly is a perfect place to share your knowledge.
good,"This company has been imaginably wonderful to work for as a single mom, the hours, the bonuses (if you hit your goal for the quarter) I think they have made the bonus structure a lot harder to achieve. Management does play favorites and making a career ""advancements"" means moving laterally for a while.  I have been with this company for almost 10 years and have gotten so far to just be the Inventory Control Specialist. Management has proven support for advancement but no one seems to move for quite some time till there is a re-org. I say if you haven't moved up in 5 years move on. Don't do what I did."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"There is so much to do here and a lot of opportunity. Onsite:"
good,I feel that management promote not the qualified but the individual that they know. I was passed up on a promotion because I was set up for failure. Seems that if you know how to arm a building you get the position Instead of  who is more qualified.
good,"Bestbuy was cool at first then I moved to different store and it was not."
good,"Depending on if you're going for sales or not, it's a very competitive work environment for GSP (geek squad protection) and numbers matter the most for your supervisor/manager. But if you can maintain those numbers as a sales associate your fine. "
good,"Best Buy is a place where you will be happy to work along side your fellow colleagues. While they do teach you a lot and you will develop very useful sales techniques, their goal-oriented vision may become too much. Sometimes it seems that is all the company cares about, and nothing else."
good,It was something that I don't regret because I gained a lot of experience  from it .Retail can be hectic but I would recommend it to anyone just starting in the tech world.
good,"Managers can be rude to employees and push really hard for you to get high numbers, even though they give you nothing in return. Helping customers can be nice, but a lot of rude people like to shop there and will ruin your day if you let then get to you. Fellow employees are nice, on quiet nights it was fun talking to them."
good,"It probably shouldn't be the place you rest your entire career on. Moving up is difficult and the environment can become toxic depending on management and job type. With that being said it is a good place to learn basic sales skills and can provide and good atmosphere to work, make friends, and figure out the next stepping stone in your overall career path."
good,"Started off as a great company to work for , but the amount of restructuring that happened in my time there became ridiculous . Every few months they would implement new changes in the processes . Made it difficult to effectively do your job on a consistent basis ."
good,"It’s a typical retail job, you get paid above minimum wage, but you take a lot of stuff. Lots of call outs & not even labor hours to work what we need."
good,It's a job for younger people. The pay is not something an older person with a family can survive on. Unless you are in management you may want to  find a second job.
good,"I enjoy the environment and people who work there, but oftentimes the repetitive reminders of store goals and performance push become increasingly more annoying when I'm trying to focus on the customer."
good,Everything came down to if the customer bought items or services. If one it was good both was outstanding. If you are able to get geek squad attachment  that was all icing on the cake. When coupled with the items and services. Then the client was protected from the m them to stern.
good,"I loved the people I worked with but since they changed the bonus structure, you being asked for more for less. I left the company as a mobile specialist which is a higher position than a standard associate. I only made an extra dollar. More complex transactions and tougher goals, low compensation."
good,"Best Buy is willing to work with associates to make sure they are getting all the resources to be successful with the company. If you have any problems, HR and respective supervisors and managers are willing to make things right."
good,"Great if you wanna learn product knowledge or sales. Low pay, but stock purchase incentives among other things. No place to move around at the time I was hired. Management did not know I was there for 5 years as sometimes stores rotate management to often."
good,"If Best Buy is your first job, it’s a great place to start! Management is great. You truly belong to a team. Not the best place to start a career, but it’s definitely a great place to learn and gain work experience."
good,it was very flexible with hours and great benefits but management was terrible there is favoritism clearly to the eyes of most people in the company and when you go throughout HR they do nothing
good,"Good part time job for college student. In my opinion, the expectations for the sales team is too demanding. Some mangers micro manage. Holidays are stressful."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"best buy is a pretty chill place to work at, no stress, everyone is pretty chill. i personally haven't learned any important life skills from best buy. a typical work day for me would consist of me coming in at 6 in the morning and scanning the entire  store, replace the incorrect tags with correct ones , noting is hard about the job"
good,Productif avec beaucoup de challenge. J'avais beaucoup de plaisirs avec les employés
good,"its more of a sales job. if you don't hit you numbers they question if your doing your job right. I enjoyed the people I worked with cause they were like me!"
good,"I loved working at Best Buy until my being a leader almost got me fired. We used to have ""mobile leads"", which were seasoned mobile employees who were responsible for training newer mobile employees. When the position was eliminated and we got a new manager who had never worked in mobile before I stepped up as ""mobile lead"" to assist in the transition. During that time period my team excelled, achieving the max bonus every quarter for 3 straight quarters. However, because MY specific numbers weren't as good as the rest of the team, mainly because I spent a majority of the time training the team, the store manager was going to fire me, although my mobile manager vouched for me stating that I had been a HUGE help in his transition to that role as well as the roll-out of the company's new mobile carrier plans. My mobile manager informed me of the plan to fire me so I was able to secure another job and leave voluntarily. This experience soured my overall experience with Best Buy and led to me ultimately leaving the company as a whole."
good,"They offer decent employee discounts, and the coworkers/management was great. It was kind of flexible hours in that you had a lot of time off, because they didn't always fill your work day with as many hours as you may have wanted."
good,Okay Job. Going in and not knowing when you get off is terrible. The people I worked with are awesome but some times the job would over flow you very quickly
good,"It was retail, and while I was isolated from that at geeksquad, I was still limited in my ability to help customers because of the nature of the business."
good,"management made the job much harder than it should be, business plans and strategies from a cooperate level didn't make much sense to me. Often resulted in cutting hours when demand for them were needed. Staff members clearly carried the store while management didn't really help out when needed."
good,"You get out what you put in with Best Buy. The more you strive on learning, challenging yourself, and seeking guidance, the better you will do. Typical days and management depend on location, like most jobs."
good,Great place to work and a ton of opportunity for advancement and growth. Work-life balance will be a challenge as you grow in your career because to be successful will require long hours and days.
good,"Was given chances to train employees when needed. "
good,The best thing about working at Best Buy is the sales driven environment and the customer interactions you get to experience. You learn about the latest tech.
good,"Helped clients with diagnosing computer problems and providing them with the service to get the problem corrected. Gave classes to clients on topics such as: Cloud technology, MS Office applications and how to use anti-virus software"
good,"Amazing benefits/employee programs and perks - financially, medically, product wise."
good,"A day at customer service started with making sure everything was clean and organized. You had to make sure that the Store Pickup section had all of the items there for the morning and that all returns and downtime forms were taken care of, as well as double checking with the warehouse team to see if recycling and PRC were handled properly and put away/shipped. During the day and further in to the afternoon, you want to make sure that all counters, desks, computers and surfaces are clean and presentable for the customers. You will take the majority of returns during this time and when received you want to inspect the items, and if open, open them and see if all of the required return items are present for the return. When the inspection is complete or the item was not open, you would make sure to put them in the right tote for returns or shipping according to the tags printed for the product (applies to open items only). At customer service, you would also make exchanges and price adjustments. Both are similar to the return process, exchanges being a return with the added purchase, and an adjustment requiring you to either apply promotional coupons or look up online prices for both Best Buy and other online competitors. Store pickup transactions are another duty you have as a customer service rep. When the customer approaches, you ask three questions to start the interaction; ""What is the last name for the item you're picking up today?"", ""May I please see your drivers license or State ID?"", and ""What is the item that we are picking up today?"" You'll use this information to complete"
good,"So yeah. My career there ended on a sour note. I was often praised for the work i did. i sold many financing applications. i hit my goals. i was having a blast. but then i was moved into a different department. a couple months later i was butting heads with management. i then was about to move on to a new amazing career and i was told "" you're just gonna come back, and never gonna make it"" Also i was told to ""stop interviewing for higher positions"". Fun if you don't want to move up quickly. Oh and drama was the number one item of the day. the assistant manger has a childlike overreacting personality."
good,"As a sales support employee, much of the work is labor focused and requires a lot of physical energy. Receiving product from trucks and UPS, bringing product to the floor, and locating product for customer orders make up most of the tasks for the position."
good,"Job is good. Promotions are done with politics. There are lifers who will work there until they retire, therefore promotions are done via “whose gonna be here the longest”. Job duties consist of everyday retail sales and customer questions. Nothing that one can’t handle. Retail will someday die. I see Best Buy as a block buster. If online shipping can do same day delivery... Best Buy and many other will be no more."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Bestbuy is an amazing place to work without the goals you have to hit. It’ll teach you a lot about patience and if you really like customer service jobs. No tech background is needed. You learn on the job. Some days are stressful and some days are stress free.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work. Only left because of poor relationship with another manager, otherwise great retail career possibilities within the company."
good,"You get to learn a lot from the e-learnings as well as selling the products. If you're department has a TEAM that works together, then its fun, but when they don't work together and leadership is terrible; you won't be having fun and they will stress you out for not hitting the monthly goals that are asked."
good,"Our team was fun to work with, and the hours were flexible. The bonuses were frustrating because when I was there the whole store had to succeed for you to get your bonus for hitting your goals, but I think they've changed since then. The work was fine,  though it was hard on my back to stand on the hard floors without sitting for hours and hours. Pay could (and should) be better for the amount of product knowledge we were expected to learn, retain, and use."
good,Was able to learn many new skills and product/ service development through the duration of my employment with this company. Job rotation training skills and continual educational workshops were offered and completed.
good,Managers are a little aggressive for credit card Applications and they Lie to customers. It was a good company nice benefits for employees but did not like how they try to swindle customers to apply for credit applications. Great coworkers and atmosphere.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time working with Best Buy. I learned a lot about generating sales, such as how to communicate with the customer to find a product that best suits their needs. I enjoyed working with my managers, as they taught me a ton."
good,"The actual job wasn't that bad. Lots of time walking around and socializing with coworkers. "
good,"Like any retail position, a huge part of the job will be dealing with the cyclical nature of shoppers and other staff.  Inconsistent shifts and varied demands from managers contribute to a very active work environment."
good,"I loved my time at best buy at first, but things just began to get more unrealistic ad time went on. My hours became random, some weeks I'd only be working for only 8hrs in total. The drive for the branded payments became too much as well, wanting me to push the credit card on customers even when they said no."
good,When you first start working at Best-Buy its a dream come true but give it a year and a half and all the long employed associates start to hate working there. The pay is generous with lots of benefits but major power struggle and high stress environments even on slow days start to make you question the worth of pay vs the mental strain this job puts out.
good,"Morning meeting ,go clean and check departments ,check warehouse deliveries and new merchandise trucks coming in,"
good,Great Place to Work! Enjoyable from beginning to end. Management was very flexible with employees and there was a very positive vibe around the store because everyone seemed to be enjoying their jobs!
good,There is a sense of family with your store but often times a lot of favoritism takes place when it comes to getting promoted. Hours are not constant and don't expect to work more than 25 a week if you're part time. Also don't expect to be promoted to full-time either unless you originally apply for that. The discount is amazing and the 45 minute lunch break is good as well but that is pretty much it.
good,"I honestly loved my job; however, false allegations, poor management, and pay issues pushed me out of Best Buy; while I do not blame Best Buy corporation, I do hold them responsible for the ineptitude and incompetence of taking management to task."
good,"The pay is decent, however they're very reluctant to make anyone full time, but they'll work you full time hours.  The managers are all great, but there's a lack of communication between them leading to conflicting orders.  If you're sales they'll kiss the ground you walk on, but any of the operation positions are treated like an inconvenience to the store.  Also, don't expect them to back you up if a customer complains about you."
good,"Best Buy was a good place to work at, but the only thing I didn't like was that there is no guarantee of getting a full time position there. Other than that it's a place to be, especially the people that you get to work with."
good,"I liked working here but the mobile department is a very intense branch to work in. Honestly  for the first couple of months I started to realize and notice how bad the management was at my store. Also my coworkers were great but they would not for your life, repeat something they told you or showed you two or three times and granted it takes alot of memorization and knowledge to know how to activate mobile devices , along with knowing your way around their mobile system in general, and comprehending the different carrier plans/protection plans. It 's just very overwhelming and stressful at times because it is alot to take in and they just expect you to know everything withing 3 months it felt like."
good,3 months out of the year is rough. Long days and nights and too many people to have small amounts of employees cover. Ecommerce sales have been expanding each year...
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy can be a fun place to work. There is a pretty nice culture. Depending on role at the store will determine how you will be compensated. But the people that are selling more of the higher end products tend to enjoy there jobs more often than lets say Asset Protection. With that said there are opportunities for growth within the company.
good,We have a lot of great managers and a lot of good employees but having one bad manger can kind of ruin everything. One of the managers makes everyone’s day AWFUL and even some of the lower managers hate her. Great employee discount.
good,"Basically there's a bunch of favoritism, i would assume in any store. "
good,"Overall fun company to work for.  Typically slow pace at location I work at.  Some management pleasant to work for.  Other management not so pleasant.  Typical day is preparing deposit, running reports, printing items opening manager needs for day.  After opening I monitor the front of the story and provide support as needed."
good,"I moved from a seasonal employee to Magnolia Design Center System Designer in 4 years. I was recognized by upper management and vendors all along the way. If it weren't for the MDC store & regional managers, I would still be there. Honestly, one of the best places to work if they develop consistency in culture & management throughout the company."
good,"Bestbuy is a great way to get your foot in the door with other retailers, and you can work your way up. However, be prepared to deal with an overwhelming amount of issues. For starters, I myself, am full time, with no set schedule, and they will not let me have two days off in a row. One week, its Monday and Thursday, other days it's Sunday and Wednesday. On Top of that, Bestbuy is rolling out a program called Total Tech Support, which is pushed way too hard onto associates, they have goals which only 1/10 Associates seem to hit. Corporate is cracking down on it, and its stressing the associates out. They expect us to have a 15 minute interaction while also bring up Products, accessories, protection plans, credit cards, total tech support, and ring them out all within a short time period. "
good,"Aside from low pay, and terrible general management it was a fantastic company to work for. Active learning environment was daily challenges to always help one improve"
good,Working at best buy started off good but then hours started getting less and less I went from 25 - 30 hours one week to 14 hours for 2 weeks and get little to no money.
good,"This is controlled by management, they need to be more selective of who they employ as manager, not for their exuberance but their morale of how to coach individuals to get ahead. Some managers will work with your hours needed. otherwise mostly friendly associates"
good,"Working at best buy is a good experience, my job got me a foot in the door. Although there is not much room to move up unless you're able to transfer to another department in your store, there is also a very small annual raise (less than 50 cent)"
good,"A typical day at best buy starts with you being prepared. Prepared meaning dress code, presentable and well mannered. Once you're ready to work you punch in and check you weekly numbers to see where you're excelling and where you could use some help or training. Now that those are all complete it is time to sell and give an amazing experience to each customer, through interactive demos and solutions that fit their needs and future needs as well. Management gets hands on with training and constant numbers updates to let you know where you're at and to keep you motivated. the hardest part of the job is driving into sales without knowledge and the proper training. the most enjoyable part of the job is Building rapport with many different people and being able to connect in a short time gain trust and have fun while providing everything they need."
good,"I miss my co workers, but I don't miss the job, especially around the holidays. I don't really have anything else to write, so this is just filler for the minimum"
good,you clocked in did your job clocked out and left thats how it went on a day to day basis. the growth was very slow only going up a few cents at a time.
good,The environment and the co-workers were really laid back people. the work hours just weren't there for me.The work paces wasn't too bad and the pay was pretty decent for what was asked of you on a daily basis.
good,"I have never felt more guilty or treated as unengaged as when I would get sick and couldnt come in to work... its sad."
good,"A typical day involved assisting customers with their home theater needs and creating a positive shopping environment in order to drive sales. The job was only part time, so I did not expect a large amount of benefits. The monthly sales bonus for reaching a target sale amount was an awesome incentive."
good,working here was fun and always had something new going on. I feel that the management helped tremendously in advising and growing all associates. the deals are always good and there isn't any micromanaging
good,"When I first started as sales at Best Buy, it was great. I was treated well and enjoyed working there. However, they want you to be extremely numbers and sales focused while driving it into your head that you are part of a non-commission sales team. Best Buy has plenty of benefits and can be a really great place to work for some people. However, the fact that they want you to ""be human"" and drive experiential selling while still being super numbers oriented and focused on upselling is just plain hypocritical."
good,"Have been working for Geek Squad at Best Buy for almost 5 years now, and while I definitely enjoy my job, I never felt that it was place I could stay forever."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"To start out, I wanted to work with Geek Squad since I was a young lad.  I applied over 8 times over the course of the 8 or so years it took to get a second interview."
good,"Great Job for college kids, excellent learning for technology and handling customers in all aspects of the sales process.  sales and communication was great, credit application and financing training as well."
good,"For the first year and a half i loved working here, but with a change of behavior in management, and lack of support from management and corporate, it became a toxic workplace, where many of my fellow co-workers wish to leave."
good,Not a bad place to work but of course not the best. Certain positions there are a dead end so be careful what position you take and how long you plan on being there. The work schedules are pretty flexible even for a full-time person.
good,"As the title states, this job is a great way to build your repertoire of skills and develop yourself into a leader of some kind. If you're looking just to work hourly and do just your job, you may have some difficulty, because you are always encouraged to learn more and to do more. The Company as a whole encourages you to go ""above and beyond"" not just with customers, but with yourself as well. Keeping this in mind, this job is not an outright stressful one, and with any job, it has its days, but I would not steer anyone away from at least experiencing what Best Buy has to offer them."
good,They are very demanding and inconsistant. They don't help when it gets busy. They are bad a scheduling staff. I got schedule when I wasn't able to work.
good,"In charge of customer service, camera, theft, and arrest. Great company to work for was very well taken care of. Everything is organized and very clean."
good,El ambiente es muy bueno pero los horarios de fin de semana son muy distintos
good,"Do not do inventory, the pay is not worth being the mule of the company with no recognition. Inventory is 80% of the revenue, so they need to fix the attitude when it comes to the position. The retention rate for every best buy I have worked at for inventory is also terrible, and no one knows how to manage it. "
good,"There is no commission on sales. Your personal incentive for making sales is that you won't get fired if you're good at it."
good,"Cool people, horrible customers, but just not enough hours for me as part-time. Managers were cool, the pay wasn’t all that decent but not enough to live off of without having a second job."
good,"A typical day at work would be a fun, positive, and vibrant workforce. As soon as you arrived and punched in you were immediately faced with your tasks for the day and your expectations."
good,i liked working there but it was a seasonal job. but i had a choice to go back and work there i would.. it was a very good and easy job. you just standing up for 12 hrs 6 to 7 days a week
good,Working at BestBuy was an amazing opportunity for me to advance my skills in customer service and learn new techniques and gain experience. The hours were also good.
good,I thought the team I worked with was fun but the arrogance of managers a lot of them can really hinder developing teamwork. The experience was ok at best. lol
good,"•	Diplomatically resolved customer’s complaints on as-needed basis."
good,Best Buy is a very large company they changed from commission pay structure to a hourly wage.  That is when we decided they couldn't pay me enough and offered a severance package instead.  It has been a long time ago so it is not right for me to rate them mat this time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"long day not enough pay ,no reconition at times but fun !"
good,"It was a very enjoyable work environment, meeting new people, helping customers with their tech needs. The only thing I would say that was not fun is that two of the managers did not care very much about our school work load, whenever we would ask for less hours, they would not give you less hours unless you harassed them constantly."
good,"overall I would say a good place to work. Management can be pretty tough on you but they were successful in getting the job done in the most effective manner. More often than note customers would leave happy, though it is inevitable to have the odd unhappy customer. The coworkers I had were great to work with, making slow days seem bearable and busy days work smoothly."
good,"The culture that once made GeekSquad great has been stripped and replaced with a ""one Agent fits all"" tasks type of structure. No longer can a person truly specialize and excel. Local leadership is outstanding and works closely with employees in an outstanding manner."
good,It’s a good place to work while going to school. The store I worked at was always understaffed and new team members do shifts by themselves. A lot of trial by fire experiences could have been avoided if there was more of a on the job training until the member was comfortable being by themselves. Great benefits and employee discount.
good,it was great until they sprung a mass layoff on us then trade4d our jobs to overseas. then only compensated us enough to maybe survive 2  months on a slim severance
good,"a typical day of work consisted of answering emails, contacting stores to check inventory. Get paperwork ready for the deliveries. "
good,Overall great company to work for but experience is based on location. Management can be political which is expected in this type of environment. Would recommend!
good,"Everyday is different, new customers new solutions. Management was getting threatened constantly from higher ups so their stress became ours. Working at Best Buy became a bit overwhelming for me (college student) for that reason."
good,"Very fun place to work, the work needed to do was easy to learn. The culture was great. A typical work day included greeting customers and grabbing inventory needed."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work if you love electronics of all sorts."
good,Very dynamic work environment. Excellent coaching and training support system. Management team is very supportive and helps in  lot of training and coaching of the team.
good,Typical day at work involves you getting there on time and clocking in and getting ready to love your job cause it’s the same thing everyday. If you like schedules and routines. Best Buy merchandising is the place to be.
good,"if you are looking for a part time handy job to get on ya feet , this will be one of the best choices for you. you will handle with various amounts of lifting if placed in the warehouse / backroom."
good,"Company has a decent culture and promotes advancement, but for the work you do in GeekSquad or Best Buy Mobile, the competitors offer better pay, often with commission for the sales jobs. I had a wonderful direct manager, but our higher up management wasn't great, so your experience will differ greatly store to store."
good,"I think it really depends on which location you work at but at my location the store leaders were always excellent.  They made sure the employees were taken care of and had opportunities to advance in their careers.  They were very supportive and I never felt uncomfortable.  I think there is a disconnect between corporate and each individual store, though.  It never felt like corporate was willing to take responsibility for failing policies and was cutting benefits to employees that they swore to focus on.  It was frustrating at times and had it's ups and downs, but I generally liked working there."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work for anyone interested in technology and looking for a milestone or pit-stop on their way to bigger and better things. The culture of Best Buy is all about being the best and still having a good time at work. The hardest part of the job is the stress. There are certain jobs within the store that are very demanding have a lot of responsibility but may not be compensated to balance out.
good,"fun competitive environment.  Great place for college students to work who need a flexible schedule. Nice Full time benefit package. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Fast paced environment in which the customer comes first. Help customer solve problems by suggesting the best solution. I learned how to think fast and provide excellent customer service.
good,"Don't expect to ever move up. They keep cutting managers, and very few full time positions are available. YOU WILL WORK ALL HOLIDAYS!!! You also get a lot of time off. Expect to be very understaffed even during holidays. Also expect to be over worked and never thanked for your work. This is a job that requires politics. It's who you know not how you work."
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for if you are working through school and need a part time job. The culture there is really good, but if the store has poor management, it can be a big emotional drain."
good,Fun place to work. Learn about sales and team work. Go to school while at best buy!. You should always try to learn as much as you can. And take on more responsibility. Hardest part is to learn how to work with management. MOD
good,"Its a beneficial job with room to move up in the company. Discounts and accomodations are nice however, in my experience the management were all very hypocritical which wouldnt be very much an issue if it werent for the micro managing."
good,The atmosphere was usually relaxed. As with any company you had some bad apples. Just had to deal with them. Management was hardly a presence on the warehouse floor unless there were visitors. They provided a family oriented environment and allowed individuals to advance.
good,"Fast paced and forward thinking organization. "
good,"The job itself is very easy, the shop isn't massively busy and mainly relies on regulars who are generally all nice people up for a chat. I'd sit there at the till with my laptop open, getting on with work or such like. As far as the job goes it was pretty decent to be honest."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for 3 years at 3 different stores, I had 2 good managers and moved up very quickly. I became a Verizon Expert after 5 months and after that there wasn't much room for me to advance anymore.  Overall, it was a great experience, it was a lot of fun but also very stressful at times."
good,"Okay place to work at, you would have to go up to customers and greet which is fun to but would have to push customers to buy products they do not need."
good,"As long as you understand what you're supposed to do and get it done, you'll enjoy your time here. Just come in on time and listen to any and all kinds of directions."
good,"Leadership stresses sale of protection plans, low reward for selling large number of plans. The people that work there are great but experience high turnover, not unusual for retail environment."
good,Based on sales and profit  and job performance mostly sales and profit. It was stressful and hard to get off and I worked every aindke weekend. Never a weekend off
good,"I am very unlucky with management. My manager at Best Buy mad the job unbearable with general rudeness and lack of empathy. I treated all of my coworkers and superiors with respect, and generally received the same in return. However, one bad apple spoils the bunch."
good,"The job was cool not too difficult not too easy, only problems i had were with the management and the customers. also some of the other workers there would snitch on you as soon as you did something wrong"
good,"I like working at best buy because of my co-workers. They are great people. We all get along, we go out together all the time, great group of people. The management there could be better. I am aware that everyone has there own style, but when you do not trust your 10 year veteran employee to do their job then you have a problem."
good,"It's good for young adults but no a career."
good,It was ok to work there. I didn't feel much stress or troubles. Hours were good and flexible. The fellow cashiers and shift leaders were very agreeable.
good,"Here we go again, have to write a review. Must be minimum of one hundred and fifty characters. BBY is a typical big box store that has a great culture."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy as a company is great.... however the front line managers (Sales Supervisors, GMs, Sales Floor Managers) are very numbers driven."
good,Great place to grow as a leader. Daily Challenges and obstacles that help build great time management skills. The diversity of the workforce as well as the customer base help develop astonishing nimbleness.
good,I learned nothing from this place the management team sucks they over pay people that do less work then people that work hard they allow certain people get away with stuff they wouldn't allow another person to do. The only enjoyable thing about that place is some of the people i work with other then that nothing
good,"Typical retail job,come in work do what you have to do and leave in 6 1/2 hours, distant pay if you like having more month then money! Learned a lot about cool electronics"
good,Best buy provides a great learning opportunity for someone who wants to immerse themselves in all the latest and greatest technology. Sales goals can sometimes be a little unrealistic and what is expected for an average line level employee can border on excessive. The best part of the job is definitely the discount and the co workers that you will have if you chose them as your place of employment. The work life balance is difficult in that they pay a fair wage but they have strict availability requirements that make it difficult to look or maintain a second job or seriously consider a better primary opportunity. Combine that with the difficulties of paying back student loans and lack of advancement within the company and you end up in many a coworker situation where you work everyday but will always look for something better. Raises are not competitive after working a year you are lucky to see a 50 cent raise. Many employees work there primarily for the discount benefits
good,"I worked at Best Buy for a year and during that time, being a top seller consistently, I was never offered an opportunity to advance. I was kept as a part time worker even when, in the summer of 2012, I was working 60 hour work weeks for two months because they were extremely short handed"
good,"Working here isn’t too bad, what really bothered me about working here was the inconsistent leadership. Within my career I’ve had about five leaders, which was frustrating."
good,"Working at Best buy, I really like the environment. The employees are friendly, the assignments I am assigned to are just a lot of little things so you just have to be focused. My only problem is that I am only scheduled at the very highest, 7hrs a week."
good,"Good place during the peek season to make a lot of extra money for the holidays. Plenty of steady work. But good money and steady pace comes with long hours of hard work. 10 , 12 hours 7 days a week but well worth it."
good,"Working as a general customer service representative, you get to experience how to interact with a variety of different individuals and to build yourself as a better person."
good,"I had no problems with this job except more hourly or commission would have made it more desirable. Management was fine, hours were flexible, benefits were good."
good,"cuenta con buenas instalaciones y servicios para los trabajadores, también cuenta con excelentes seguros  de vida opcionales y ambiente laboral amable."
good,Best buy offers benefits even to part time employees that many companies do not. I have found it to be a fairly positive environment during my time working here
good,"Hours are not very long. Managers are over picky on tiny things. Opportunities for advancement are nonexisant. Good job for a college student needing money. Other than that, you have to be in one position very very long to advance, or know someone."
good,"Typical day is fairly relaxed, the only time it can get stressful is when you have to deal with an upset customer. Being a customer serivce rep. you have to let any insulates from the customers just brush off of you. The most enjoyable part of best buy is the feeling like you're in a community."
good,"The people I worked with were very supportive, teaching me about activation of phones, routers, home security, and anything else I had questions about. The atmosphere there was very upbeat and lighthearted, while still about building sales and being competitive."
good,"I started off being hired as computer sales. When I was brought in, I found out that my position was given away to someone else due to them over hiring even though I was hired first. I was then transferred to a merchandising position where I was promised a lot of hours. I'm currently seeing 15 hours a week if I'm lucky."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,My only issue with working here was that I felt my job would be eventually obsolete. But I learned a lot in the tech bench. Found that position greatly challenging.
good,It was a fun place to work as a salesman but the upward movement has slowed since they have made job cuts. I love the tech that we sell and i love most of the people you work with. I will say that accountability is different from manager to manager.
good,Educating customers in tech. Presenting them with different options to fill their needs and wants. Then aiding them into which is the best option to fill their needs and wants.
good,"Best Buy is a great company for those stuck in the retail grind. They offer more than competitive annual raises, the hours are very flexible and you more or less get to pick your own schedule within the confines of the necessity of a full-time or part-time schedule. We got a new CEO my second year there and he really turned around our whole business model and ethic so we saw some pretty great and huge changes within the company while I was there. However, with where my store was located, it was really hard to take full advantage of this new model because we had really bad traffic and more times than not during the year our demographic really slowed down and the longer I was there the worse it got."
good,"Best buy is what you think it is when you walk in the store, sales numbers are what's important and try to sell as much as you can when ever possible. You or just the product of numbers there what you sell compared to every one else"
good,"If you are competitive, sales driven, and are great with electronics and the up sale, this is a fantastic place for you. There is some stress do to trying to get people to sign up for the Best Buy card, and attach warranties, with so much competition out there. If you know your technology, this would be a great job for you."
good,Fun but kinda boring not moving that much and conception all the time is great. Co workers are fun to be around and job is alright . I'd stay if they had better py
good,"Best Buy is a very good company to work for hourly teammates, having said that, the upper management team in the Tracy DC is definitely the weakest link. Favoritism from upper management towards some of the Supervisors is obvious."
good,"The hardest part of my job is not getting to spend enough time with my wife with my hours are never the same. With my income we barely make rent and bills. We just want to own our own house, and with the income from Best Buy we can't do that. "
good,From my experience I had an amazing and knowledge filled time at the store. A large part of the sales staff was very helpful from multiple perspectives in getting myself fully trained. The store itself was also quite family oriented and made me feel comfortable working with such a large team.
good,"Everyone is nice that works there however, management gives few opportunities to grow. Employee turnover is very high because of this many people only stay for a few months."
good,"Bad management made it rocky at first, but got better along the way. I worked there 8 years. My coworkers would always tell me I was a badass and a model employee."
good,"My take on this job, is an amazing skills set to have, the environment is again phenomenal, everyone is super friendly and easy to get along with, management are fun, pizza party every time AP caught someone trying to steal an asset. Very awesome place"
good,"Its just another retail place, management wasnt too great."
good,"Typical days at work are...well...typical.  You greet customers, sell things, help them find solutions to situations they present to you.  You clean, stock, inform the manager of stock level issues (not so much a matter of ""we're running low on X"" as it is ""even when we're at full stock of X, the quantity is low enough that I know we're going to be out well before next restock"".  Nothing unusual or terrible."
good,"The pay and benefits are the best part of the job - Best Buy as a company has an adjusted living wage, so even starting out employees make more than minimum wage. Depending on the state, medical benefits are pretty good, and the company matches your 401k up to 5% (part time employees also qualify). On the other hand, it's a retail store so you have to deal with everything that goes along with that. Management doesn't seem to communicate very well with each other or corporate re: expectations and policies, and are mostly focused on numbers over everything else."
good,wasn't a bad place work however during the holidays it was extremely stressful and had to work extremely long hours. Holiday plans were extremely vague.
good,"Took strict and takes the fun away from the job with the ampunt of stress do to the force uppn hitting revenue easch and every day along with horrible mamagement, they dont care and feel as if your just a replaceable car part."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy includes taking bill payments, processing returns, assisting with credit card applications and processing exchanges. At my store its very busy all year round and customer experience is all that matters."
good,Not enough materials to do the job fully to your ability. Had to come up with excuses to be able to not lie to the customers about when their items would be shipped out.
good,"They made it seem like I'd be getting a bunch of hours, but I got less than 15 a week from December 1 through January.  By mid-December, I was only getting around 10 hours, and after Christmas, they didn't have me work at all until the let go all seasonal on January 20."
good,A day at Best Buy was a fun day for learning new technology and gadgets while having great customer service experiences. I learned how to be productive in giving opinions and helping others. The culture of this job was great as it provided a connection between the regular customer and for the store as a team. The hardest part of this job was keeping phone accessories neat and tidy everyday. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that i had a team who were like family all around the store.
good,Best buy is an enjoyable place to work because you are always help someone. Management at Best Buy was amazing because they always cared about their employees. I learned how to sell more products and new computer skills.
good,"Even though the customer service side would get very intense, it was easy money. They worked with my school schedule which would allow me to do hw, work and have fun."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers, downstocking, warehouse, and using the register. I learned how to make sure the customer was always taken care of. the store manager at my location was absolutely horrible. The rest of my supervisors and managers were awesome."
good,"I worked in the mobile department selling phones and accesssories, for the most part it was ok, it was an easy sales job, but the volume of sales versus the pay which at the time that I was working there was not much at all."
good,If you find a store ran by good people it's an awesome place to work. Otherwise it's just as bad as any retail job out there. As with most places the people make the job.
good,Best Buy is really great about availability to ensure that school comes first. The ability to get shifts covered in case something comes up unexpectedly makes for a stress free life.
good,"Only worked at Best Buy for a few months as a ""SWAT"" member. The team I worked with was knowledgeable and willing to work with you and train properly."
good,There is a lot of down sizing and turnover and i just do not feel secure in my job anymore. I feel they keep who they want to keep and the rest are just expendable.
good,"My time with Best Buy has been a good experience so far. A lot of cool perks, especially the discounts, and you'll meet some cool and interesting people as well. The management is accommodating depending on the store from what I see. I have been fortunate with good managers that have treated me well. Hourly and no commission within the regular sales floor, unless you have a Magnolia Design Center or Pacific Sales position. Managers have favorites and tend to hand off sales to those people, then proceed to ""coach"" others not hitting their respective sales goals. If other departments are doing well while yours isn't, your department basically gets chewed out by your managers until numbers improved, which can get annoying and less encouraging. This is also why I became a Geek Squad Agent to get away from some of that."
good,Such a great place to work. The people were amazing. The technology was always the latest and greatest. You will love it here at the wonderful team at Best Buy.
good,Good place to work. I would recommended if you need more when going to college. Fun People to work with. Good first job experience. Not really bad pay for what you do.
good,"Best Buy is an ok company to work for. The company highly emphasizes its workers, which is great for a company that big. I think I was lucky enough to have a GM who truly believed this and cared about his team, I can't speak for other locations."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo era bastante relajado durante las semanas relajadas apoyaba en otra áreas de la tienda como en el área de E-comerce, y los días de mucha demanda era mantener el puesto en el área de cajas durante todo el día, aprendí bastante tanto de ventas como de atención al cliente y las habilidades básicas de cajero, la gerencia estaba bien administrada y había muy buenos compañeros de trabajo, la parte mas difícil del trabajo sin duda eran los clientes déspotas aquellos que te hacían sentir menos en tu trabajo."
good,"A typical day at work involves standing around waiting for stuff to happen. I learned a lot when it comes to new an emerging technology, as well as how to pitch a sale and manage angry customers. The management was as supportive as can be expected, but the higher-ups are also as lazy and apathetic as you'd expect. The culture of the workplace was a bit over-the-top as everyone was always expected to be hype about the company and it's goals, which leads to the hardest part of the job: meeting the dehumanizing goals which can only be met by overselling the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting all the great people who work there, but seeing how poorly they can be treated can be heartbreaking."
good,"Great for a college hourly job.  Management is rude and pushy and there exists an atmosphere of forced sales behind a smoothly worded veil of ""it doesn't matter what you sell, just help the customer."""
good,"I started my career as a seasonal part-timer for the connected solutions department and slowly worked my way into a full time position which eventually helped me advance into a leadership position as a connected solutions senior. This company gave me a lot  to learn and was my greatest hurdle as well, during my time with this company I had to fight a lot of get where I was I achieved awards, build excellent relationships with not only the management that I was working with but also the district team and the territory manager as well. I learned how to go past my comfort zone with the help of one of my supervisors and work my way into gaining the respect of my team to be able to lead them as an example. Furthermore, I learned the importance of multi-tasking, efficiency, being a good listener and being able to take what I heard to help the customer in front of me to walk out with something that will fit their life style appropriately whether that involved up selling and in some situations down selling and adding attachments. I learned to show value of the culture of best buy that would make the customer want to return again. I learned how to change prices, merchandize, constantly learn and even as a senior to continue to do things that I would do as a full timer to set an example that no task is to little or big. I learned to do be support for my staff and be there when they needed help with sales, returns or other tasks. I worked by giving positive reinforcement and consistent motivation to provide a positive environment to work in. The hardest part of my job was adapting into"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Enjoyed working with the people there and enjoyed the training they provide had fun while working with people in general.  I love intament interactions with the general public
good,A typical day begins with preparing the store to become operationally ready to begin a business day.  Jobs will differ from department to department but is relatively similar to any other retail job.  Management is ok but will again differ from to store to store based on what the managements responsibility is.  Workplace is relatively relaxed a most point but can become stressful at certain times during the day.
good,It was a good first job to have and grow with throughout college. I learned a lot through my experiences at Best Buy. Not much else to say at this time.
good,"If you're a good people person, then selling products shouldn't be a problem. You get to learn about the products and the services they offer the more you work there. Working in the warehouse can either be busy or slow. During the holiday season, it can get extremely busy, but usually after Christmas it dies down."
good,was not a big fan of the hrs available 3-11 training is about 3 weeks the first week was spent  going over best buy culture. that got old real quick. could of cut that down to a day or two a lot of different programs to learn. before you get on the floor very confusing and glitches. had a lot of problems with the passwords for the software to login. was frustrating had to have administrator constantly resting password
good,Friendly environment but lacks security and advancement opportunity. Poor management is a big problem in this particular location.
good,Great Place to work on the lower tier level. It was a fun place to work with my floor level employees. I was not a fan of the management but i don't like to complain. I sat there and did my job to the best of my abilities.
good,I.       think.     that the company is very family  oriented and overall an amazing company to work for the work ethics and achievements its soely  based on customer service
good,"The store itself is amazing. It is a great place to start off in sales and it has so much potential but unfortunately it limits itself due to lack of advertising and lack of incentive for its salesmen. You will be harassed if you aren't meeting your revenue goal, and if you exceed your revenue goal you will get a pat on the back. I would recommend this place as a first step for any person aspiring to be a good salesman because you get the experience of a salesman career without the pressure of commission based pay. The hourly pay is better than the fast food business but if you are a talented salesman you will be making about 0.5% of the revenue you make for the store per hour. Once you learn how to sell find a place that pays you for the revenue you bring to the company and management that respects your competitive attitude."
good,"Every work day I accompanied each costumer in achieving their desired phone plan. I learned to manage costumer wants with costumer need."
good,"Working at Best Buy may not be the most rewarding or well paying job, but at least they try to keep their employees informed and trained on latest tech."
good,"Best buy is a good starting point for people who are just starting out, especially those who are in college needing a part time and/or seasonal job that pays decently well for entry-level positions. It is by no means a way to make a living though and the atmosphere reflects that with the constant pressure. Management is constantly delegating to those lower than them and seem incompetent themselves. The higher-ups rarely do anything about firing terrible employees even when met with solid proof. The discount is the best part of working there. The hardest is dealing with disgruntled customers while trying to meet the insane demands of your superiors."
good,"fun place to work you learn a lot about products and services and is fun to work with customers. you get decent discounts on certain things of course not big major brands , its hourly and not commission based but its fun you learn a lot about protections and electronics."
good,Great place to work. Fun upbeat environment. Management and staff were great! Great customer interactions. Was able to provide exceptional customer service.
good,"Me gusta bastante el ambiente de trabajo, las prestaciones y la importancia q se dan a empleados, pero el crecimiento laboral es mínimo además de q únicamente se te asignan 5 horas de trabajo máximo al día!"
good,"Pay's decent, schedule's generally flexible and the work is fairly easy. Issue is with constant management changes as well as policy changes hat throw things off balance."
good,"There aren't many average shifts because there are so many employees at each location. In Customer Service you answer phones, deal with returns/exchanges, and online orders. You also deal with all of the unhappy customers. Company is pretty strict on small things but only because its a corporate policy thing. Employees are pretty fun, but you're only really allowed to interact with the people in your department."
good,new challenges to face on a daily basis. surrounded by interesting technology and great opportunity to convey information you are personally interested in to clients.
good,The morning meetings are exciting and the management always has the energy to pump up the sales floor. The goals of the day are set and explained to reduce confusion on the sales floor.
good,"The job is ok, only downfall is correcting misinterpreted information.  Employees are great and every one gets along.  At this location I was able to learn about different types of management styles."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"your job is fun once you get the basics and learn how to hit your numbers, the leaders there are really fun and its a great place to work"
good,"A typical work day can be very fun. Lots of opportunity to be active on the sales floor. I learned a lot about different samsung, LG, Sony products, etc. Hardest part of the job would be it does not pay enough and you don't get enough hours. The most enjoyable is getting great exercise as well as closing big sales. Co-workers were decent."
good,"Tedious work required, face to face customer service, hands on experience with many individuals, lots of company required tools to fill out daily"
good,"Interfering with my education, i was in high school, and they would make me stay there for shipment till 1 am when i was 16.. that time the supervisor was rude he would always talk to me in a bad tone and yell a me in front of customers for not selling the protection plan."
good,diverse place to work and all the managers were nice.They understand that things happen outside of work and they work with you.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work.  Revenue per hour is important but if you are barely scheduled and scheduled at low traffic hours it is hard to make that happen.
good,"Busy days in a highly populated area. Customer consulting, sales of computers and related accessories, area management, and team oriented."
good,"I have worked 10 years for Best Buy. I have concluded that it's a great company to work for. They have treated me, for the most part, with respect. I think their training program is amazing. As a company, they pride themselves as an Expert Service with well trained employees, and they act on it. I've been impressed many times by going to Market Trainings and District Trainings throughout my career. "
good,"When I was hired, I was told that there were many opportunities to advance."
good,I have worked Best Buy for a bit over the year and they can not seem to keep Managers in my store. I have seen multiple managers come and go which upsets the balance of the workplace because the standards and what your managers expect is always changing. It is exceedingly difficult to rise up to higher positions in the company if your are not in an inside loop with someone in a higher position.
good,"Its great working there , my co-workers are the best , the salary is 11$ without commission and they still pressure you to sell warranties , if you don't sell a lot , they remove hours from your shift which is horrible. If it wasn't for the people i work with i would have quitted a long time ago."
good,Good culture and great place to work. Lot of opportunity to learn and grow. Good work environment and people to work with.
good,Best Buy can be fun and terrible depending on the time of year. The discounts they would give employees would be less and less every year. Over all the management was pretty good and Best Buy would weed out the weak management quickly.
good,Great job to start out. Many benefits. Great people. Loved how it was easy to get along with others and learn things. I would highly recommend this as a starting point for young generations.
good,"if a person likes electronics and wants to work in retail then this is a perfect place for him. Good and easy going management, friendly co-workers."
good,"I enjoy my specific job duties and the client interactions. I do not enjoy the big box red tape, politics, co-workers, and the retail environment in general (black out dates, must be available all days of week, no set schedule, etc). The company does support promoting from within and plenty of opportunities to do so. However, unless you want to do management, the pay, at least for my position, specifically is quite a bit below average. After time with the company this leaves you desiring more for your efforts, but capped at low pay scale. Restructuring of company policy, pay, and benefits needed to keep good, respectable workers on board."
good,Company was fun to work for with really good employee discounts but the room for growth really wasn't there in my opinion. Fairly easy job if you know the product.
good,great work place to start at if you are into computers join the geeksqaud. working in a group of a few people who are helpful and smart with the SOP.
good,"Working at Best Buy Mobile was very fun for me, they had good management and a fun environment to work in. I didn't really like the hours and the pay. The hours vary every week and was very inconsistent. I would work 25 hours one day and then 8 the next. I also worked there for 2 and a half years and only got a 25 cent raise. But besides that, my manager, was very cool and kept it a fun environment to work in."
good,"help customers with returns"
good,"Learnt alot from this compay, there's always something new out their to learn. Iv'e learnt how to narrow down alot of dramatic situation, how to be more confident which matters alot."
good,A fun place to work with a flexible schedule and good benefits. Easy place to advance and plenty of room to climb. Large and diverse work environments.
good,I loved to work with new people and helping anyway that I could. anytime you needed help there was always someone there to lean a hand.
good,I good place for a college kid to earn some extra money for some beer but doesnt pay very well for what you do. Job can be very fun though.
good,"Working at Best Buy is a great way to develop and hone your sales associate skills. Due to the fact you need to ask opened ended questions and produce a solution that works best for you customer. Some days are busy, some completely boring. Management is awesome and helpful. Careful, when your store doesn't meet budget, your hours get cut too."
good,"Having worked in Best Buy Mobile for just shy of three years, I have learned some very shocking and important things about advancing through the company. I have exemplified exactly what a Best Buy Mobile Manager desires to become his/her replacement. The problem is that in order to do so, according to HR, you NEED 1+ years of supervisory or managerial experience in order to move to the next position. How is someone supposed to gain that experience if there is no opportunity to do so? I am very displeased with the way this current system works. I do not recommend this job unless you are alright with making minimum wage for the rest of your life."
good,The Best Buy I work at is a fun and fast pace environment that I love working in and working for. The employees make it fun and easy to be a team.
good,"pretty simple job, the people you work with are usually sociable. Set schedule on when the truck shipments come in. Can get a little hectic after halloween"
good,A typical day at work consists of customers with questions about the products they are interested in. It is all about what you know as a salesman.
good,Working at Geek Squad has it's pros a d cons.  The work environment is pretty stable.  Managers work with you to balance work and personal life.  Benefits and accommodations are  exceptional.  After working for the company for 4 years didn't really make much more money than I started.  Raises are slim to none.
good,"sales"
good,"My specific position can be quite annoying. Do to the fact that your constantly on the phones dealing with all types of customers. Some times you have great days and can leave smiling knowing you helped someone. Then you have bad days where you feel like "" is this job really worth my livelyhood"". Overall... its a great place to get the experience, its a great place to learn key customer service. Moving up in leadership is easy if you're willing to do the work. You will always and i mean ALWAYS have a friend. Last but not least. Best Buy Corp Cares about their customers... so the discounts are good, and the hr department is always there when you need them!"
good,Great place to work especially as a student. Management in stores are great but the corporate management is very unstable since they are scrambling to cut cost and compete with online retailers.
good,I love working at Best Buy but the managers are not good at leading or giving direction. They will push you for numbers but I would rather get the customer the right product then to have them walk out with a bad experience.
good,"Job was ok, thought there was little tolerance for people who did not know what they were doing."
good,"Started as cashier moved to sales floor and later to inventory. Each position was good and met great people among the way, employees and customers. This is where I learned to ask questions and talk to customers to get to know them and recommend the right product according to their needs. Management was good at first however after a while the only people that was getting promoted was the managers close friends. The people were great, helpful and friendly."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I would start my day off by re-stocking all sold items on the shelves in the digital imaging department. The store would then open and I would wait for any customers to come by my department. Any questions regarding cameras or camera lenses would be my field of expertise and be forwarded over to me.
good,"Work as a computer salesmen at Best Buy started off with a brief recap of your met goals and goals, which you have yet to achive. A sales manager would have a one to one on your preformance and highlight what you, as an individual, need to focus on. Personally, I had the top sales in services GSP (Geek Squad Protection) with 11%. The average GSP in my department was 6% and I was immediately recognized. I felt comfortable in the work place and proved myself on the sales floor by going above and beyond. Ultimatly, I decided to leave Best Buy as I felt starved by the fact emplyees could not earn more for going above and beyond on the sales floor. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, but i needed to work for a company, which can reward me for  the hard work I put forth into the company."
good,"At first this is a fun environment to be in, but then it starts to beat down on you.  Everyone in the company who is in retail locations gets their hourly figures tracked and the company tries to say it is fair, however it is anything but unless you look at just your store's figures.  It goes off your productivity per hour, as I mentioned.  What it doesn't take into consideration is the type of people who come in to the store and their budgets.  For example I'm at one of the poorer areas of our market and despite being one of the best salesman in the store I'm still ranked close to 100 out of everyone in the market for the home business group (TVs, major appliances, small appliances, car-fi, audio, and gaming).  So this is very skewed and we aren't able to have a fighting chance at getting to attend the President's Club which is a quarterly trip for the top 3 salespeople in each department because we have an older population who is very blue collared compared to a location who has mostly 30's - 50's that pull in over $150,000 a year easily."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for a first job or while going to school. Best Buy supports the communities around the stores by reaching out and teaching people about technology. You have clear daily and monthly goals which is communicated by management. But you do feel a lot of pressure to hit those goals, with little advisement. Overall the company is good and the customers are great. It's always a good feeling teaching people something new about technology."
good,"I can't speak higher of the friendships and knowledge I've gained working for Best Buy, however such great things cannot be said unfortunately in regards to the compensation of their employees and dedication of the management."
good,Myriad in outdated management techniques. Otherwise fairly easy and slow paced job with lots of benefits.
good,"I enjoyed it in high school, but much past that it is not so great"
good,A typical day consisted of morning meetings and solving customer issues during your shift.
good,I was seasonal there and the managers I had treated us so bad. They thought they were good at explaining the job and what not but really they sucked and it made my job experience horrible.
good,I learned how to interact with others as well as customers. I learned how to handle difficult situations and remain calm.
good,"I worked at Best Buy for three years from 2011 to 2014. I typically rang up customers, helped locate and inform customers on products, and kept the assets of Best secure from customer and employee theft. I was required to learn the operation of CCTV  and maintenance on CCTV and the filing of paper work such as Police Reports.I also kept up to date on any products being sold to better help customers. Management at Best Buy usually did not get directly involved with my job as it was not sales related, but when they did it was often to monitor employee behavior. I assisted my co-workers in teaching them work place safety as well as ways to deter theft. Best Buy employed some great people and it was a joy working there as you met new people everyday and were able to help them utilize new technology in their lives. Best Buy is a retail giant and as such sales is the number one priority. Often times, asset protection would be overlooked due to the focus on sales which made my job that much harder. Best Buy also likes to utilize people, but not always to their full potential. If you are in a position that you excel at your chances of being promoted diminish greatly."
good,"fun place to work with great pay however the management I encountered only liked to keep on women and fired men constantly. Also, when we were busy management would not help out where it was needed."
good,Best Buy is a retail company even though Geek Squad offers support plans. Management is supportive. Co-workers are supportive and the store operates as a team.
good,"A typical day involved reviewing performance metrics, daily dialogue with upper management and my employees, coaching and training employees, and resolving any customer issues that may arise. My time at Best buy has allowed me to refine my time management skills, learn how to continually adapt to a change in product and services as well as an overall workplace, and has allowed me to develop an efficient and productive approach on training and developing employees and peers. The hardest part of the job is being able to adapt to daily obstacles that may become present. Whether an employee call in, a unique customer situation, or any discrepancy with any product or promotion, I had to put myself in place as a go to person and provide solutions. The thing that I enjoyed  most about the job was the day to day interaction that I was able to have with employees and customers, and working in a team environment."
good,I ensure all sales strategies are met. I coach and train employees to follow the business model and goals. Technology is always changing so I get to see the latest and greatest devices. I help ensure every customers needs are met in a timely and professional manner.
good,"Usual retail sales environment wherein as a team you are tasked to sell a certain number of products and services to customers coming in the shop."
good,Great job for students in high school/college. Flexible scheduling with good overall benefits
good,Great for young people wanting to get a career started. will provide training and advancement for those thaqt are willing to work hard. Not a family friendly work environment.
good,People there are fun to work with but unfortunately the management there is very poor.
good,The environment was great all around and was a team players.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Picked and packed various products in a fast paced environment, sorted product for different levels and areas to be stocked, stocked product in appropriate spaces on time, drove forklift to move and transport various products to different areas of warehouse, loaded/unloaded trailers for delivery and counted product in various departments for inventory."
good,"I enjoy working for this company."
good,Was a decent place to work until new  management and new usom models came out and ruined the company
good,Geek Squad is a very stressful but overall fun and educational working environment.
good,My schedule would say one thing one day and my manager would change it without notifying me. The more you gave of yourself to the company the more they picked on the little things to make your work seem valueless. I always enjoyed the people i worked with always full of energy but frustrated because of the same reasons. The amount that i was paid was not enough for the stress level that i have to take for the job.
good,bestbuy now under pays their employees so managers bonus. great place for a first job to understand retail.com. coworkers are great and a great place to have fun.
good,"Relaxed culture, work around schedule very easily, goes through management restructures too often, similar jobs pay better"
good,"Having Knowledge about Tablets, Cell Phones and Contracts, Computers, and Home Theater and being able to convey the use to customers."
good,"The hardest part of the job was when I got trained in another area, instead of having me work that area, they were understaffed and required me to work both places. The co-workers in general were easy to get along with and motivated. I learned a great deal about computer software and hardware and especially how to resolve even the worst of computer issues."
good,"Worked under several GMs in a couple of Best Buy stores.  The current Store is 300 miles from district office and this seemed to contribute to the inconsistencies.  There was little validation of execution therefore only a great leader that was accountable could run the store efficiently.  There were many complaints of favoritism.  The last couple of GMs I worked for had a hard time effectively running the store and this made it difficult for the store to run smoothly.  Often, it came down to working doubles or extra overnights to fix store for audits last minute.  Still, the staff was younger and fun to work with.  I learned many things that helped my career.  Meeting new customers and helping them find the right product was enjoyable and the company truly made it about asking questions to fit the customer with the right product and not about pushing product they didn't need.  I enjoyed working for the company and believed in the values they put forth.  They have excellent benefits.  My regret was not having used the tuition reimbursement because the workload and hours required were so heavy for salaried employees."
good,Co-workers are great and keep the job entertaining. Work load is high and compensation is low.
good,great people great oppertunities as well.prettty awesome place to work as well.
good,"Despite me being a full-time associate with Best Buy, I have no set hours so my schedule can be at any time during any day of the week. However, I have learned a lot about products, selling, customer service and the likes from Best Buy which has proven useful throughout my employment there. Management has always been strong within Best Buy but the company itself often times switches management too often to have a concrete structure. My coworkers is really what makes my job well-worth everything I have to deal with on a daily basis. I get to work with energetic employees who are able to bring some realism into the work place. The hardest part of the job is the frequency of what I'm doing on the floor; even though I am coded as a sales associate, I work Customer Service, Inventory, Product Team, etc. The company doesn't employ positions to any specific field and rather has a large group of employees doing whatever tasking is available for the sake of busy-work."
good,"Management needs work"
good,Typical work days include a relative easy going environment which entices selling.  The management team can be helpful when needed.  Co-workers are your teammates and often times have to work together to accomplish task which a great thing because I much enjoy being engaged with others and there thoughts and inputs.
good,"It's decent job for getting experience with customers, sales, and relationship building. If you take this job seriously enough (but not too seriously) you will gain some valuable skills. The day to day tasks are nothing out of the ordinary retail sales experience. Sell products, warranties, services and get people to apply for the credit services. Many of your co-workers may complain about having to, you know, WORK but like I said; go for your sales goals and you will develop sales, interpersonal and relationship building skills."
good,"Working at Best Buy has been one of the most enjoyable work environments I have ever been a part of. The Management team here is very driven, but also laid back. Like most jobs should be, as long as you are hitting your numbers and doing your job correctly, everyone is fun and enjoyable. Truly my home away from home."
good,"At every best buy I have worked at, your coworkers are the one's who make it fun. You will always have those that just don't like people, but for the most part, it's a fun place to work. The only reason anyone would ever dislike this job, is the managers relentless push to sell specific things...never mind that the customer doesn't want it or need it. I learned so much about electronics working here, and about people as well. Ultimately for me the most enjoyable part of my job is the daily interaction with customers, even the mad ones."
good,The hardest part of the job was when you have a angry customer and you try to offer different solutions to accommodate them but they are not trying to agree
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A typical day would be taking care of recycling, sweeping, dusting. Also, taking care of machinery and equipment. With this job, I was taught WHIMIS due to the fact that we handle machine batteries and such."
good,"At Best Buy, I learned how to sell products and overcome buyer's remorse. I also learned how to work with a lot of personalities. A typical day at work is selling tablets, answering customers' questions, and interacting with staff. The management is easy-going, but I do think they are hard to get along with, which sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. My co-workers are all around my age; most go to UCF. We all get along. It is one big family. The hardest part of working at Best Buy is that it never stops feeling competitive and stale. It is always a fight to get numbers up; which causes me and other co-workers to feel uncomfortable. Sometimes it's up to you to figure out what to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and co-workers."
good,"Best Buy was had its ups and downs. It was a great place to work because i met a of good people (co-workers, sales reps) working there. I got the opportunity to work in a few different positions from Cashier, Customer service to sales associate. I am very good with people so the job came very natural for me. There was no part of the job that was extremely difficult but maybe getting a good schedule and hours since i was part time. The best part of the job was hitting your numbers and working with great people. Cant beat that!"
good,"Favorite part about the job is being a leader to the sales floor; getting them to customers. Inspecting everyday work equipment for any defects or hazards. Co-workers were very outgoing and supportive to each other, managers work with you personally to help make the schedule for you. I've learned to pay attention to detail by identifying and detaining shoplifters, teamwork is a very important and influential part of the work force."
good,"I learn something new everyday working at Best Buy due to customers being interesting. The couple of stores I worked at had a great management staff you just had to deal with cocky college students as your coworkers, which they can be lazy at times. Overal, great place to work if your filling in a job while at college but if you can become a manager somehow it is not a bad gig."
good,Good place to start. not a long term place. Very close staff.
good,"Working here definitely gave me a boost in my people skills. It wasn't all that bad , i had my share of good and bad but i always got my work done."
good,"Help as many costumers as possible. Give them the best overall experience possible. Selling phones, plans, service plans, and accessories. Management was decent but overall a disappointment. Coworkers were hard working and down to earth. Hardest part of the job was getting along with upper management, just like all other coworkers agreed. The most enjoyable part was helping people, answering their questions, meeting their needs, and giving them the best overall experience."
good,"Specialty electronics retail store.  Provide high level of customer service in all areas of the store. Including TV, Appliances, Digital Imaging, and Mobile Electronics.  The mot enjoyable part of the job is helping customers connect with the right products and services for their lifestyles.  Coworkers are committed to helping customers. Management never seems to be on the same page which makes accomplishing the overall goals a bit difficult at times. Not quite sure what guides they use in terms of career advancement."
good,"Working at Best Buy had it's pro's and con's just like any other job. It was a retail job, so there was not much as far as bells and whistles go. Advancement was pretty much non existent unless you were good friends with Management. "
good,"Company is ok to work for.  People are generally great, the only downfall is they push you to get the credit card."
good,Administration in a retail setting consists of preperation for the days cash and reconciliation of the day before. Maintaining employee files and assisting in daily responsibilities to help better the customer and associate experiences in the store.
good,Decent work/life balance. Store management can sometimes be sub par as is the case with most retail companies. There is a horriblle good ol' boys club atmosphere no matter what area of the country you work in. So you must suck up to advance. It is enjoyable however to be surrounded by co-workers who enjoy the same day to day things and are on the same IQ level as you
good,"I was in charge of selling home theater products to customers. Anything from cables to televisions to sound systems were in my department. Greeting customers, answering any questions they may have, and completing purchases were my day to day responsibilities. Management typically only came in to handle issues with POS systems and to conduct morning meetings. My co-workers were great and we all helped each other out with customers and with any questions we may have had regarding product. The hardest part of my job was completing purchases. Best Buy had a certain system where you had to go through numerous people throughout the store to complete some of the items purchased and it wasn't very efficient. The most enjoyable part was giving my customers exactly what they wanted and in a timely manner and also answering any questions about new technologies."
good,"I think the company is a good place to work, have fun and at the same time make a good living."
good,I love interacting with people everyday.  I also love the challenge of paying attention to detail and creating a great work environment.
good,"Though I worked in multiple positions, the general formula in working with Best Buy and Geek Squad is to learn and apply.  Through their many learning programs, systems and on the job experience I was able to aquire the skills in repairing and working on computers, to running departments responsible for $25M in sales.  The hardest part of the job is the work life balance.  You must sacrifice weekends, holidays and adhere to a strict availability in this career.  The most enjoyable part of the work was solving technical problems for grateful customers.  They often are at their wits end trying to figure something out, and you get to be the hero."
good,"My typical day would be spent most of the day in the back room pulling merchandise to stock shelves, shipping and recieving products and pricing. I learned how the shipping and recieving process went. Management there was very nice and supportive. My co-workers and I all worked as a team."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Geek Squad as a whole gave me an opportunity to primarily practice and establish my skills as a computer repairman. I learned how to efficiently manage my time at work by dealing with multiple customers while having to finish other previously requested orders.
good,A typical day at work involved helping customers and maintaining department cleanliness. Through this job I learned how to effectively communicate efficiently with many types of people. My coworkers were great and it seemed more of a family than just people I was working with. The hardest part of the job is communicating effectively enough with the customer to make sure they are getting what they need to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the various types of customers I get to interact with daily and the coworkers I get to work with.
good,"There were always new things to learn new task . only job that was mundane was cashier during the day . They have daily testing called learning lounges some odd 2000 test for the company and for products sold in store and they increases daily . "
good,"Coach, teach sales/closing tactics. Your store's performance is not judged monthly, weekly, but hourly. Great energy from the employees."
good,"If you get this job, it has some good benefits and job security."
good,"A typical a day at work included helping customers with basic questions and needs they had with any merchandise we had within the store. I learned how to engage customers, be more outgoing, listen carefully, and speak comfortably in front of crowds. I very much enjoyed working for this company, but left to seek out a new career opportunity."
good,If you want a great discount come to Best Buy! The hours can be hard if you expect to work all days and no weekends then Best Buy is NOT for you. If you want to work with a great bunch of co-workers then you will find that at Best Buy.
good,this was a great place to work and the managers were great but very low pay
good,"Your typical day at Best Buy involved coming into work and digging right into the previous days numbers.  You then compared them with your monthly targets and looked for opportunities and victories.  After that was done, you hit the floor and checked in with all of the associates to ensure that they knew what their goals were and how they were performing for the month.  You then made sure that every customer coming into the store was contacted properly and efficiently.  In between customers and employee conversations there were Customer issues that you had to resolve as well as employee issues.  You were also in charge of scheduling, labor, employee reviews, staffing, training, employee accountability and performance management, implementation of weekly and monthly business initiatives.  "
good,"Great company. Great training, promote within, benefits, fun place to work. Bonding between co-workers and management. The messages are clear from corporate, to territory, district and to the store."
good,"A typical day at work was to always go over and beyond the daily goals, help out as much as we could at all times. And be productive."
good,"My work day was helping customer find their needs for their entertainment in their home or offices."
good,"My typical day at work consist of making sure all product is accurately accounted for, and help customers if needed.  Through the 12 years of working for Best Buy I learned to be more efficient, time management, multitasking, talking to customers with confidence, and respectful to my peers.  My current management is good but respect my direct manager a little more than the others because he help me out with whatever I need whether it is work related or personal.  My co-workers in the department I work in are great people to work with because we respect, and help each other out.  The hardest part of the job is to deal with upset customers.  the best part of the job is that I have a set schedule, and I have great people to work with."
good,Sales oriented job and keeping up with employee oriented issues within the Mobile area. In this fast paced environment I had to keep up with all the latest cell phones and apps to best fit our clients needs. I also had to keep up with what the associates needed to preform their jobs as best as they could. Most enjoyable part of my job there was the fast pace and never slow moment.
good,"It's retail, so the aspect of dealing with angry customers every once in a while is there. The pay wasn't great, but it was about what you would expect. I love electronics, so working with them and gaining a lot of knowledge about them was a plus. The employee discounts are definitely the best aspect of working at best buy. It was dangerous though, because it's so tempting to buy something every time you work. Most of the managers were reasonable, but often times weren't much help when you needed assistance with a customer issue. I also did not like the corporate culture of the company. It felt like they were trying to brainwash the employees, and it made me very uncomfortable at times. I also did not like how there was no compensation when we got people to sign up for credit cards, cable subscriptions, and other things of that nature. Towards the end of my time working there, there was a big push to get every employee to learn how to work in every department of the store. This was overwhelming at times, and there was also no increase in pay for having to do more work. "
good,I Started off as seasonal help was promoted to full-time. I had high hopes but the company was a total letdown.
good,It is a very hard job to work and have a family. Retail lifestyle makes it hard to raise and infant and be there for the milestones in their life.
good,"Work with customers, find there needs, make recommendations, demonstrate products and knowledge, upsell accessories and warranties."
good,"I joined the leadership team as a supervisor. Directing teams of 5-20 members in different departments.(Appliances,Home Theater, Computer Home Office) I was very successful in training sales associates in company SOP. My strengths were training and monitoring adherence to our core values."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The store I work at is a ""test store"" and we are small. We don't have a lot of employees, I feel, not enough. My hours are not what I would like them to be. My managers want more for the store and everyone tries their best, but the company makes it difficult in most areas to please most of the customers."
good,"Overall Best Buy is a great company to work for. Some of the upper level management have alot to be desired, and need better leadership skills."
good,"Leaders up to directors exist in the same space (no rooms) making their accessibility great. Not the best compensation provider but great driven culture. IT processes are immature and provides a huge opportunity for process driven folks, only if management knew how to balance power of developers against process specialists."
good,"Working is Best Buy has been a truly rewarding experience. I am blessed to have been in a leadership position and having had the privilege to influence many people with my knowledge, my experiences ( life and professional ) and my style of leadership. What I enjoy the most is working with people. I feel that my priority is my team and then our loyalty to our customers. My co-workers ( at this point in my Best Buy career ) are the best I have experienced. There is plenty of support, loyalty and integrity in this group. There is no hardest part to my job. My day is pretty easy. Maybe the distance and time I have to invest committing and in traffic."
good,"Was promoted after two months of being hired, learned why numbers are important for a departments performance."
good,"As part of the team in Geek Squad, I ensure that customers receive exemplary and thorough service. Each customer is a new and challenging opportunity, from OS X and Windows software to PC and Mac hardware. My comprehensive Mac and PC skills lets me effectively manage each situation, pro-vide the customer the best level of problem isolation, education and solutions possible. I thrive on an exceptional customer service experience, from support to sales."
good,Well Monday & Wednesday are truck days which are the busy days the truck usually comes with 900 - 2400 items on the truck which me and about 5 to 6 other employers unload it.
good,The best part of the job was giving hands on experience to customers using the lastest phones and mobile devices.
good,Working at Best Buy is fun because I get to interact with many different people everyday. It is easy to move up in the business as long as you do your work right and it is a very friendly environment. It is a nice place to meet people and to gain work experience right out of high school. It is a very close and family like environment.
good,"Making strides at bringing in some new leaders, but place is slow to change their ways."
good,I enjoy working for this company but I am looking for a career that I can move up within the organization. I have a BS in Business and this does not seem to mater in advancement with this organization.
good,"manage department of electronics, and have sales goals. able to manage different departments"
good,"As soon as I step into my work area, I already feel at ease. Handling customers over the phone and in the building would be a hard task for others, but for me its a natural instinct. With this job you will have to have to make some leadership decisions (which can be the hardest thing to do) since management isn't always around but on call if there's any big problems. Over all I feel comfortable in any environment I'm in but this job i enjoy my time there with the staff and also learned so many new things in the short time being there."
good,I take every work place I am at as an experience. What I took from Best Buy was that even though mistreated by the some members of the management I still kept a good work ethic and I still gave 100%.
good,"The company used to take really good care of its employees, but I left right before things started going down hill. With many friends still employed, the company has curtailed benefits, cut pay, and added responsibilities. My position required extreme mental toughness, as I was essentially an over hyped greeter."
good,"I loved working there, for every reason, but they couldn't keep me busy. I was eventually laid off."
good,"Best Buy was a very enjoyable place to work, but like most jobs of a similar calibre, what made it most enjoyable were the people you work with, not necessarily the job itself. However, I liked being around customers and providing the very best I could for them, and making sure they leave the store with a smile on their face and confidence that someone strived to provide excellent service, tailored for them."
good,"So I'll make this short and simple, I worked there for 8 years with about 3 promotions (nothing big). Day of work Cleaning, stocking shelves, and selling. One thing is that they do teach you a lot on how a business operates, and how to sell certain ways. But would you care if your just a PT employee who's in school??"
good,Flexible hours and understanding when it came to family emergencies or personal time.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Once I have applied for the job i did not know what i was in for. First couple of weeks were pretty good, but the more I did he job the more fun I had. Everyone at Best Buy was really nice. The hours were workable, even though i worked crazy shifts, but the overall experience was good."
good,Best Buy is a good place to work for people that liked being part of a large group. You work so much so often that they become your family. You tend to lose your life outside of work.
good,its a great part time job while going to school but not a long term investment with out store transferring or management backround.
good,"Best Buy is an enjoyable place to work. With new management in the building, we are constantly being challenged to strive for the best for the business. We are surrounded by technology, and the skills to better our understanding for our work environment."
good,"Here there will never be a dull moment in working. There's always a task to be done, and working with different people is always a good challenge. As far as management, its terrible. They favor, and don't really do much as sales leading. They tend to be lazy and expect so much from you. So don't expect much from management here."
good,I was part of a work experience internship with best buy.
good,I was hired on as a Delivery Driver for a few months as I searched for a position within my field. After learning there was no advancement into management without taking a pay cut and switching position
good,"Laid back work atmosphere, will work with you on scheduling. Many members of management on ""power trip,"" which is not necessary in a retail store."
good,Employment here is fast paced and busy. When I need something fixed the problem is fixed. Inbound calls come through frequently and the day can be long and draining.A pat on the back saying your doing a great job is appreciated. I enjoy working in an environment where I can help others and make their day better.
good,"Best Buy has been a great place to work. It does have some drawback as far as advancement, and management. It is not very easy to get promoted in the company and management doesn't always get things done in a timely manner, when it comes to client complaints. This sometimes leads to client disappointment and the employee gets stuck in the middle. The people that I work with are great though and they are always trying to do what is best for the customer."
good,"Working for Best Buy is very fun, helping customers listening to what their needs are and then providing and recommending a perfect product that would help their needs becomes very exciting. During this interaction with the customers you not only learn what the customer is looking for, but you also learn about their everyday life and the lifestyle they live. You interact with people from all over the world. Learning different languages and different styles makes the day pretty fun and easy."
good,ive learn the benefits to holding yourself accountable and not putting the blame on other people. which made me self analogize what needs to be worked on to bring a better atmosphere to the work place
good,If you are living in a job working your week is not spending time with your family this is a job for you. Plus lifting very heavy flat screen TVs 90inch by herself with no assistance from any of the other employee.
good,"Had a fantastic  experience at my first store. Fun and productive coworkers, great management team, overall store camaraderie and morale were awesome."
good,it wasn't hectic it has its peak moments staff is cool management is great they are friendly but assertive they made it a great experience and its sad that my contract ended or id definitely stay.
good,"This job is SALES geared. If you are not a salesperson, this job is NOT for you. That was my only hangup. I am more of a customer service representative."
good,Typical warehouse environment. Nothing out of the ordinary. Willing to work around your schedule. Very helpful co workers. No incentives. Decent benefits
good,"working in the call center was very fast paced which i loved. i loved some of the staff as well. some people really wanted to help the customers, which was big for me."
good,"My customer service skills grew, was taught multiple different methods that have helped me when it came to customer satisfaction. There were always great team building work shops."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Had been with Best Buy for a while before and left due to an injury. After four years doing other things I came back seasonal hoping to stay on. Bummer they couldn't keep me around.
good,"Everyone at work gets alone great, we're one big family, but they hire managers that don't have any experience managing a team. I would like being apart of a team with more experience."
good,"Wasn’t bad working for them in Oklahoma, I originally got hired on as asset protection (AP) shortly after earning my certification through Bestbuy training program to become an asset protection specialist."
good,Family-like culture with plenty of room for advancement within the company.  Typical day was extremely fast paced but there is a great team that has your back.  Managers are friendly and willing to help you succeed.
good,Was there for 13 years. Various positions from customer service to Sales floor to Best Buy Mobile Standalone. Working with co workers was most enjoyable portion of the Job.
good,At times it was hard meeting the stores monthly quota which impacts your yearly raises and store incentives. There is friendly competition in the workplace
good,"My collective experiences at Best Buy were some of the most informative and memorable times of my life. I've been yelled at and cursed out by customers, along with being offered huge tips and job offers by others. Employees and management have taught me many life skills and lessons that I will remember for the rest of my life as well. Everything being considered I'm thankful I was given the opportunity to part of the team."
good,"Do your homework,  know what you are applying for and be honest.  Interview then was thorough and precise. Always tie in what you have beeb successful at."
good,workplace culture is good but this is not a place to work for your entire life. Good for college students or high school students that are managing studies and work.
good,"Best Buy was a fun environment depending on department. I didn’t actually work for Best Buy bust Mosaic rented a space out for Samsung Experience. Overall, the employees seemed happy"
good,"The diversity of the team as well as the high paced environment was a plus about working at Best Buy. "
good,"Customer service and helping others was the best part of my job "
good,"Best Buy was a very interesting place to work for and prepared me for future sales positions. At Best Buy I was able to learn valuable skills I can apply in other careers. I am thankful for my opportunity to work with a great set of people at the Best Buy of Aurora, Illinois."
good,"Best Buy provides opportunities to exercise leadership skills. As an expert, I am able to coach peers on performance and invaluable skills. For example, it is not uncommon for me to coach a coworker on how to talk about a product. More importantly, I am given opportunities to teach fellow coworkers on delivering customer experiences every visitor deserves. "
good,"If you ever need a job that doesn't require that much previous knowledge of the workforce look to BestBuy. They don't ask for much, just that you do your best to be a great team member. My experience was middle of the road and I didn't want to work in retail for forever so I eventually left. I was part of their loss prevention team which fit with my security background, however I ended up being a normal greeter which I didn't agree with. At the time of writing this review it's been several years, so maybe they've overhauled some aspects of that particular job. Another good thing I can say is that I still have friends that work at that store to this day because they stuck to it and moved up when positions became available. Like I said, if you want to learn what retail is all about or are in between jobs and need something with a little job security I would check out your local BestBuy"
good,Best Buy cares about their employees. The company is all about building an inclusive and diverse culture. The benefits are hands down the best you will come across
good,"Most days, I would clock in and ask the department to lead what needs to done (restocking, cleaning, or counting inventory) take care of those tasks and helping customers in between. Whether they had a simple question or wanted to set a whole order with services, I would always drop everything for them. Once you understand the products in your department, the job was pretty straightforward and easy. Now the negative is that your sales are tracked. Every day you need to meet a certain quota for revenue, services, and credit card sign-ups. So if you have a slow day or month, it can reflect poorly on you."
good,It was great until the new CEO took over. They got rid of a lot of leadership and advancement. Now they ask way more than they ever did from positions they retained after the restructure.
good,Employee discount was the best thing about working at Best Buy. The hours changed so ofter and the mandatory overtime did not allow for work/life balance to work out for your average person.
good,"La routine chaque jours mais avec des défis clientel superbe ,collegue  beaucoup à apprendre mais j etais la pour les aide et je developpais mes idée chaque jours beaucoup de travail."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Fast paced, if you mess anything up you’re going to hear about it, and you need to be good at multitasking, memorizing 7-10 digit numbers and organization to be any good at the job"
good,We had to show but if it was full we got sent home.. So basically we was there for no reason and we could wake up an get there an get sent right home.. An some of us is working harder than other folks an would get sent home.
good,"Worked in customer service for a little over 2.5 years. For the post part it was fun working here. Co-workers made the days better especially when you had a day full of thought customers, which was probably the hardest part of the job. Holidays were long days but very fun. Some of the managers were really supportive, especially in when working in customer service and the customer wanted to speak the the manager. Managers would back us up and stick to company policies. Learned how to deal with hard customers, solve issues, and more about the tech world."
good,"It was a enjoyable work place. Great people wonderful mangers. Flexiable hours and workdays, always something to learn about every day I came in to work"
good,"Awesome company to work for! Hardly worked weekends. The people were cool and the job wasn’t that bad either definitely bareable! The only thing is you can’t afford to live working there. Definitely not if you have a family, however if you’re a single person or in college then it’s a good job for you!"
good,Employees and management are super helpful. Our E Learning skills were super helpful. The hardest part of the job was during closing hours we have to down stock our inventory. The best of best buy was creating new friends and gaining knowledge of electronics.
good,overall it was a good experience if you like technology. There was always something to do and was a fast competitive environment. managers were always awesome and understanding about your life
good,The amount of enjoyment depends on you and how you view your team. This was an excellent job to have while going to school and provides full time employees with exceptional benefits.
good,"They pay could have been better, but the discounts made up for it.My only complaint was poor management from within the Geek Squad, but I am sure other Geek Squads with different management are better."
good,"Come in, check daily goals & objectives. Always offer best buy credit card & rewards card. Always greet and assist customers. Team effort building and assistance."
good,"If you want to learn how to be patient, empathetic, and deal with almost any type of issue involving products or services, this is a great experience. "
good,"It’s a great starting out job,  but not a career. Not really much room for advancement and management is very stressful for most people. They are very sales baby and want you to hit every metric when sometimes it is just not realistic for the customer."
good,My experience with Best Buy was fun. I enjoyed learning about customer service and finding the right products for the customer based off their needs and wants. Sales unfortunately is not my thing so I ended up let Best Buy go.
good,I enjoyed my job but over all work life was stressfull i didnt really like my co works and felt judged at all times good job but the people are whgat killed it for me
good,"Decent place to work as a teenager. Good discount and until you really get sick of retail, Best buy treats you right. Last year every employee got a $1000 bonus just because the CEO felt like it."
good,"Amazing work ethic from every employee, willingness to help-out and show new employees ways of doing tasks etc, kind management, as well as flexible hours"
good,"Very good job for teens who do not have much of responsibility. Will not get many hours, but will gain a sense of independence. Managers are really nice and helpful."
good,"I'd love the place, if they didn't only give me 4 hours a week as soon as I got there. I wasn't even given an opportunity to be valuable. After I finished training I started getting one half a shift every week."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Management was always very helpful in trying to help you be the best you. only thing I didn't enjoy was sometimes felt understaffed."
good,"It's not the best place I've worked, if you have low ambition and don't mind double standards and little recognition this is a great place to just soak up hours with minimum effort."
good,learned how to sale products. Best Buy was a good experience  for me when i was younger. They helped me establish my communication skills better than I ever imagined
good,"The people you meet, coworkers and customers, will be a part of your life even after you move on from the company. It is what you make it. I had an amazing boss who listened to his workers and tried to get them what they needed for the job. My coworkers had an amazing personality and high energy, which made time fly by. Working there is hard work and they have high standards."
good,"My experience at best buy gave me very important skills that I know I will need in my future. It gave me the skills to answer questions when put on the spot and the skills to appeal to what the customer wants. A day at work involved restocking items and helping people find the laptops that were ideal to what they wanted to use it for. The management was stern yet forgiving to a beginner like me and were constantly optimistic about hitting the daily target even on slow days. The hardest part of the job was restocking all the items during the holiday season when sales tend to peak. However, the job was fairly enjoyable because I met multiple multi-cultural people and learned something new about the people I interacted with everyday."
good,Great and fun place if you enjoy sales and talking about electronics. Not easy to move up to managment though. Management is friendly and flexible with employees
good,I managed a Media Play store and Suncoast Video store from 2002-2004.  They have since closed.  This review will not tell you anything about Best Buy specifically.  They were the parent company.  I always had fun at work
good,"The employees at Best Buy are very passionate about what they do, whether it's sales or merchandising everyone wants to get their job done in an efficient manner. Team work is highly regarded throughout the store as one department relies on the rest of the store as well. Management does exceptionally well at communicating with their team and overall creating a good work environment. However, tasks do get repetitive and there is a lack of incentive for departments outside of sales."
good,"I’m not sure if they were being sexist or they just have very poor management. The training was a joke, they only trained me for a week and I wasn’t even scheduled for the whole week. The only time I was really scheduled was on blackfriday week and only once or twice every other week. I would go into the store and talk to other seasonal employees and they would tell me they were getting at least 20 or more hours a week. I talked to multiple managers about it and they would tell me they would try to figure something out but it never happened."
good,"Best Buy offers a great sales positions for simple and easy work ,  the work environment is fun and management is helpful.  Best buy also gives good benefits to its employees ."
good,"Could be very stressful at times - had lofty revenue per hour targets, practically got no holidays off, and dealt with irate customers on a daily basis. Hardest part about the Job had to be the revenue target. However, having an amazing supervisor and the tools to learn all new kinds of technology made it worth it (and employee discounts).fd"
good,"Laid back environment. lots of walking to deliver and install toner and maintenance parts to HP Printers. Must keep your thoughts to yourself, never voice your option. Fellow technician offers no support or idle chatter."
good,Les collègues et les superviseurs/gérants ont une super bonne attitude c'est vraiment une ambiance chaleureuse même si vous êtes nouveau. J'ai quitté cet emplois car je ne me voyais pas en tant que vendeur de garanties mais plutot comme un commis qui va renseigner et conseiller les clients sur les produits.
good,Good place to work just wish there was an opportunity for commission. I was apart of home theater and there were days when I sold over 10 grand with nothing to show for it on my pay check
good,"Upon hiring I was under the assumption that all students that worked for Best Buy received tuition assistance. I was incorrect with that assumption. The hours were long, especially as the holidays came along, but as a college kid (part-time) I discovered that I was picking up the slack of the full-time and eventually, realized this and came to the conclusion that I needed to leave. I was offered an amazing package after I left, but decided that staying with the company was no longer a good thing for my mental or physical well being. With that, I will miss the people of Best Buy, but I will not miss my job."
good,"Great company to for, and get pick up some useful skills. If you're looking to stay in touch with the latest and greatest technology out there, I then I recommend taking a position with the GeekSquad."
good,"Okay place to work, but there was a lot of issues with management. There was a lot of times there was no discussion, or way for employees to know what was going on or happening until management told you it was happening and you immediately had to go along with it."
good,Beaucoup de pression pour un travail qui n'est pas à commission.
good,If you enjoy working on computers and keeping up with technology then this is a good place for you to start a career. The only problem I had with this job was the pay. You will not be able to feed a family here for sure. If the job paid more I would still work here.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It was a great first job. The pay sucks and you can find way better entry level employment with so much better compensation. The culture was great, discounts were amazing, and I learned a lot there. But bottom line I work to make money and I couldn't do it just working there."
good,"Management is great. Hardest part of the job is not juggling multiple instances at once, but having to also deal with team members outside of the department. Its fun and encouraging working with the team at Best Buy"
good,"Very competitive and goal oriented. A good building block to anyone looking for a career of strong work ethic and achievement. Regimental and precise system of business, in terms of department and associate roles, core accountabilities."
good,Not enough pay at all. A lot of hte itme i would go in. Cannot do too much. No comission off thousand dollars worth of salles. Definitely not a place to stretch my creative freedom and use my degree to the fullest.
good,"Not a bad overall place. Working in retail is not for everybody, and it wasn't for me after a couple of years. Not a bad entry level job after high school or during college."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Best Buy. I enjoyed being a supervisor there. I enjoy teaching and coaching associates. Being a assistant manager there was a bit more stressful.
good,Commission plus hourly would retain so many great blue waves. I do believe management makes a store great. I have walked into many other stores to be embarrassing compared to the one I worked at.
good,"The pay does not match the effort put forth in geek squad, however it is a brilliant way to learn more about your craft and customer/employee relations. Its a nice stepping stone but not exactly one that has alot of advancement opportunities"
good,I worked for best buy while in college. I started during the fall holiday season and was one of a few people kept on permanently. It was a good job for a college student but I wouldn't want to work there forever. For the amount of stress and the sales requirements there are better jobs available in my opinion.
good,"Best buy is an amazing start for those who want an in to almost any other job. As a stepping stone best buy works on every level. They'll work with your scheduled, provide you with hours if the supervisors and mangers like you. After a while however this job runs its course and slowly but surely you'll see obvious glares in what once seemed like the perfect job."
good,Not a bad place to work. As stated you will learn new things and learn how to troubleshoot and think outside of the box. Pay is okay but you do have employee stock options.
good,"Working at Best Buy was a worthwhile experience. The only reason I left was because I was offered a position that paid more. That being said, if you are someone who shops at Best Buy regularly, I'd recommend going for it. you get a decent discount and management is attentive and wants you to do you job to the best of your ability and will fill in the gaps accordingly. You gain skills multitasking, communication and team building, which will greatly influence your future endeavors."
good,Fun place to work with tech and inform the public on how to use their phone. If this job was based on a commission style payment structure I would not have left.
good,Exptreme sales oriented as expected for a retail store. Cares about employee performance over customer appreciation. Benefits are amazing with great medical and 401k with amazing employee accommodations.
good,It was a good job to work at for knowledge of the newest technology and innovative products.you stand on your feet all day but have to make sure you get a customer to  sell to otherwise you're in trouble
good,Spent most of my time making sure other adults did their job. In order to fire someone it took too much time and effort to get someone out of the store that should have never been hired. The pay is fair and the work is minimum.
good,"Too much focus on the numbers, last supervisor was not a positive person. Enjoyed the job until transferred to that location. Went down hill working under a person focused on only numbers"
good,I had the ability to move within the company once I had been there long enough due to good track record. The employee discount was pretty good as well.
good,"I may not see this as a forever job but if you want to gain experience and are still in school I would say take it. The benefits are amazing and that is not something I can complain about. It will seriously help you when you need something (electronic wise). Management I really disliked at my location because they only promoted family members and did not promote others.Otherwise, I do not believe this is the case for all best buys."
good,Best Buy was a solid work place. Fun to learn and be apart of an awesome team of people. I agreed with how they ran the store and the way they wanted to treat customers on a daily basis.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It was very fast paced. The hours were stressful but that's retail for you. Management was okay, I got the impression they cared about you but certainly played favorites. I loved being able to interact with people and I was very passionate about selling the product."
good,"Depending on the season, it could either be really fast and fun, or really slow and boring in the store. During my time there I learned the ins and outs of consumer electronics and home theater equipment. The management was ok... it was better when I first started, but then the sales floor manager left and the bosses left over were lackluster. I love my co-workers, they were all smart, funny and nice people, that could help brighten up my day. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the retail system used to compile a list and sell things, though it got better by the end of my time there. The best part of my job was interacting with the customers, being able to learn who they were, and let them experience who I am, as I helped them build the inner workings of their home. I miss my customers."
good,"this is a work your way up type of company, and with that being said i'm proud to say that i made it to a a certain point with hard work and persistence."
good,"There was always something to do, always something to train for. If you made an error, there was always someone that will train you to become a better CSR or RSA. There were hardly any discrepancies."
good,Over all job was good but some customers are difficult to deal with . To each his own. Company is great over all just the location is what was off about it.
good,"Company great, but pay is ok if you get the hours. Need to compensate better for employees  who go above and beyond  there expected jobs. The perks of having great discounts at the store"
good,"At the end of the day, its another retail store that will pay new people way more than you. Loyalty doesn't mean much, and you have to deal with the general public. That being said, all of those can be a plus if you're just starting. So overall I would say its a good place to work if you need a temporary job before your career."
good,"always someone willing to help and support you "
good,"High sales goals, sometimes almost impossible to attain, but its a typical sales environment, fast paced and at times fun and laid back. But overall fun place to work with great people"
good,"i loved my coworkers, my customers, learning about products, being able to get my hands on new technology and work around something im passionate about. however, it was a seasonal job, which i had asked to be kept on year-round. i was unexpectedly cut of the schedule and was left in the dark. it was not the fault of the managers of the store, but rather a communication error with the higher up staff. it was a let down, but i still enjoyed my time there"
good,"While the scheduling and management were, at times infuriating, the pay, benefits, and work environment are well worth the few negative aspects of the job"
good,"The work was not difficult. I deepened my knowledge of the inventory department, management was always supportive. I'm an older person and the culture was that of younger persons."
good,I enjoy working as a Geek Squad consultation agent because my position allows me to be hands on with devices that I know very well. This makes the job comfortable. So for anyone looking for a position in the Computer Repair field this is the place to go.
good,It’s good place to work if you wanna learn and become a competitor perfect environment for people that loves challenges i love working there everything is calm we help each other out to make sure the store is running well
good,"It is a great job to get started with but not something I would consider for a career. The holiday hours made it really tough, but it was flexible with my class schedule."
good,"I worked at Best Buy for 13 months. The atmosphere was friendly and managers there were likeable. The employee discount at the time afforded me things I wouldn't have otherwise been able to buy with what I earned. I begged for a full-time position constantly, but it became apparent after awhile that they prefer to keep as many part-time workers as possible so as not to be required to offer benefits."
good,I went through both Best Buy and Geek Squad my opinion of the two is that Geek Squad was an amazing experience that helped launch my career. But at the end even though you were going in to fix items there was more pressure to add on services and sell to clients in the home.
good,"The work was alright, for the most part. I was pushed into a position I didn't like after my other one was abolished, and management was rather vindictive and got on my case for each and every little thing possible. Others liked working there, I probably would have too if I had a better position."
good,Almost all of the employees are very warm and welcoming. I felt like I was a part of the family from day one. The corporation takes good care of the employees when it pertains to food and money.
good,"Normal retail. Some managers are looking out for you, and some are only looking out for themselves. Holiday season is rough and the amount of work life balance goes out the window."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,was very rewarding to be able to help customers coming in to the counter with computer issues and watching them leave with a smile on their face. Most of the time issues were quick fixes.
good,It gave a good learning experience in sales and custom dealing. However in the location I worked the management was too focused at micromanagement which I find at times is demotivating. Salary wasn't that great but the benefits were decent.
good,"Prepare customer orders for both DELIVERY and SHIPMENT. Effectively organize and search products within company system. "
good,"Moved the dc to another state was laid off .Was a good place to work. Lack of communication.typically worked ,8 -10 hrs a day.learned out to run a department ."
good,"Overall Great place to work, the managers were very thorough with training and made sure you fully understand your job. I started working here with barely being able to use a computer and within 2 months I was a computer expert.  The biggest downfall was most positions are part time."
good,Didn't love it but it was a good place to start when I moved to a new city. There's room to grow but you may have to relocate. The company has restructured so many times that it's hard to keep track and the full time positions are becoming fewer and fewer.
good,Management was the biggest problem with Best Buy. The only way to advance was to really know the right people in the right places. Overall it was a fun place to work but not as a career.
good,"Working here in all honesty was boring and there wasn't ever really much to do through out the day unless there were sales, customers returning merchandise or it was black friday. I suppose it was not the job for me, since I like really busy work environments and Best Buy was not one of them."
good,"I was cross trained in several different areas of the warehouse,if one department was slow but another one was short handed they made sure the work got done. Loved my supervisors,and got along with a lot of the people in the job."
good,"Daily interaction with customers and learning about new products"
good,"Best Buy is big on sales so if that's your interest, then it would be great. Alot of great people work within this company and there's a good work/life balance."
good,"Good temporary workplace. Offered flexible scheduling, offered generous room for advancement. Depending on position, more hours may be needed to fulfill."
good,"A great place to work. The people are friendly, it is a retail job with customer service. The hours are both nights week ends and days. the staff is friendly and hard working."
good,"Im a people person, so being able to work with customers to satisfy their technical needs was rewarding.  It  afforded me the opportunity to work with a team and to sharpen my communication skills."
good,it was a great place to work for and people there were also great just that the hours i was given were very minimal i was only being scheduled 2 days a week i was basically just making enough money to pay for my gas to get to work
good,"Bestbuy store is a ton of fun to work at, you get to meet a lot of people and the customers are usually relaxed and just need some help to get what they need or they come in to get their computer fixed, all about good customer service to have a good time."
good,Keeps you up to date with the newest tech and what's going on in the world. Good managers. Fast paced company. Deal with customer issues and very big purchases
good,"Worked at a Mall kiosk in a best buy mobile store.  Specialized in phones, data plans and accessories.  Fun high tech job with a young atmosphere.  Great place if a phone wiz."
good,"Was a pretty easy job, just talk to customers, see if they would like to buy anything and get it for them. Coworkers were great, they were easy to talk to and in general cool people. I left because the job gets very boring, and management gets annoying when they continuously ask you about sales, etc."
good,"I worked at two locations, one was awesome (Patchogue).  The people were fantastic and if I could go back in time I would do it all over again.  The second location I was at for a short time (Beaver Creek) and lacked the atmosphere of awesome that the first possessed."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great team members. This is definitely a place where you can grow in the age of technology as well as individually. The skills you learn here you can definitely apply to your personal life and for future reference.
good,"Hired for my musical capability and talent at playing the piano. Instantly taken on as their music departments piano instructor and in charge of piano lessons with a bonus salary. In charge of opening and closing the department and assisting customers with product knowledge and instrument sampling. This entailed me to learn the guitar and a few DJ boards and how to operate various musical equipment to better showcase each product for the buyer. "
good,"working for Bestbuy I've learned a great deal. from keeping up with the latest and greatest technology to customer service. "
good,"Working there was enjoyable, it was hard work most days but the management understood this and compensated well for it. We frequently received free lunch or breakfast and played games during down times. Everyone was nice and helpful and understanding if you had difficulty completing tasks."
good,"Technology everywhere you look, very fast paced environment. Great place to learn new things. The management is very responsive and helpful. Geek squad is very great as well."
good,answering questions for old people that could not work technology to save their lives. Dealing with morons on a daily basis and having to keep up with productivity goals even though we were not commission based and were definitely not paid enough in the mobile department for the kind of things we had to deal with.
good,"A typical day would be looking for ways to prevent theft. From associates as well as customers."
good,I enjoyed working for best buy. I enjoyed unloading the trucks meeting new people. I wish that I could have stayed. I learned a lot of different tasks with this company that will always help me out if I ever got back in retail.
good,"Good high school job. I would recommend to anyone wanting to start in the sales field. I will say that the nature of this being a retail job, there are many downsides such as working holidays, little vacation, working weekends and customer service."
good,"Was great at first, I got plenty of hours and felt very engaged in the workplace and driven to perform. After the holidays, if you're part time, they don't treat you very fairly and you'll get around 4 hours a week, which isn't enough to pay any bills. Unless you land a full-time position or don't mind only working seasonally, this place isn't for you."
good,I worked here for a short period of time as well. My direct supervisor stuck up for his team with the GM and the other store manager on the regular. He made our team fun and enjoyable to work on while still hitting our sales goals. Corporate decided to restructure how the stores ran and so my managers job was no longer existent. Everyone on his team left at the store after that.
good,i loved working in florida my managment team was amazing very understanding and positive. when i moved to connecticut the culture changed. i idnt like it as much anymore.
good,Its great if you like you who you work with. Great hours very understanding wish i would still be with them. If you can get in and you speak french i highly recommend it
good,"Best Buy is a very unique place to work of course being around so much technology. it's very knowledge demanding job especially if it's a Best Buy that functions as one sales floor  and not as departments. it's easier when it's as Departments because all you need to know is that certain department but if it's one sales for the new need to know the whole store. it can get overwhelming sometimes but besides that it gives a sense in pride, knowing that you can sell a TV turn around and sell a computer that can turn around and sell a car radio installation.but the main focus to keep in mind it is not just the core product is important but also being able to  self protection or services or both.  But it's a job that requires a lot of knowledge."
good,Granted going into the position knowing that I was a seasonal employee and I did an outstanding job for the company. Management knew how good of an employee I was but because of corporate policies I was let go.
good,"This was probably my favorite place to work as a store. There were a few things that made me leave, say they're non commissioned sales people but have to act like one to keep your job. Don't know if it's like this anymore, but you used to be compared to stores in your company and if you weren't in the top 200 they would manage you out."
good,Best Buy provided me work when I was just out of school.  I advanced quickly and with a hard work ethic received praise and strong support from management.  Happy with my time there.
good,"typical day at work would start off with the daily morning paperwork"
good,"I worked in nearly every department when I was with BBY for 2 years.  It's never a boring day & your shifts go fast.  Holidays are a blur but manageable, as long as every dept does their job to run smoothly.  "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,best buy was fun and the people you work with was great but they do a poor job letting you know sales is important especially when they focus on helping customers and usually customers don't need to buy the best of the best for their needs
good,Great place to learn vital factors in retail to help build you professionally and allows you to move around and understand other companies.
good,great part-time job when you are in school. The people you work with are nice and supportive. Not recommended for a career unless you are willing to transfer.
good,"When I first started, the work environment was a fun and enthusiastic to be in. After a few years, a few new policies and restructures, everything has gotten progressively worse. I've learned that hard work here rarely goes appreciated."
good,Good company to work at. fun environment. cheerful staff. but salary is low. you sometime get overtime but still salary makes a huge difference.
good,"Really loved the people I worked with. They made the job worthwhile. It was one of my first jobs, so I was able to learn lots of important skills"
good,There are great co workers and a lot of opportunities throughout the company. I wish they had more stability and not as many lay offs or store closings. Sometimes the goals that need to be met are too far out of reach no matter how great of a salesman you are.
good,"Employee's always having fun. Mangers did their best to keep everyone motivated. Fun time, warehouse/inventory was the best. Always pushing each other to get the job done, fast and right."
good,"Every day you would fill inventory and wait for customers. Not a lot of action which would lead to a lot of down time. Pushy on sales, which can be annoying."
good,it's a pretty good place to work if you're a student; a fun environment to work in and the people you work with are generally friendly.
good,Sell geek squad protection and checkout customers. BestBuy gets the good uppity customers so its easy to sell protection and things.
good,Working at Best Buy I was able to gain valuable knowledge as far as technology went.  The management was very understanding making it easy to work there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how each employee in different departments were not self-centered and were always willing to help each other out.
good,I enjoyed working and learning here. I had great coworkers and managers. It was nice to be a part of a team that was very knowledgable and helped each other. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because when it's slow you do not get enough hours to get by.
good,"Worked at Best Buy no for almost a year and a typical work day definitely leaves me with feelings of accomplishment. Not too much down time which, can become very monotonous quickly. Co-workers are absolutely phenomenal and cohesive. For the most part, I wouldn't trade them for the world. Management is fair."
good,"Typical work day at Best Buy would entail checking product inventory, software updates, program details, training on new/old products to stay proficient for the clients/customers. Management team was very professional when it came to training employees on products and handling client/customer issues and concerns. Hardest part of the job was no room for advancement in a career with the company. All the managers play their favorites and only promote who they are friends with."
good,"I work in a fast pace work environment that is constantly changing.  I take request from other departments and service centers to see what I can do to help them do their job more effectively and quicker such as building reports in Excel, databases in Access and uploading to SQL Server.  I answer emails and phone calls daily, help out employees with questions or solutions, file documents, Meetings with visitors, create PowerPoint Presentations, Word Documents, order supplies for departments monthly and I work closely with Management and Supervisors for reporting structures and data analyze.  The hardest part of my job is customers not knowing what they want and spending countless hours on a project that they decide later that they don't need or want to change the entire scope.  I enjoy helping others out, being challenged on a daily basis and always learning something new."
good,Great place to get hands on work with basic IT level work. The pay is subpar but they're pretty flexible with hours and school.
good,"A typical day consists of assisting customers with products and trying to sell/upsell. Working here, I learned how to sell to customers and obtain even more knowledge about certain products."
good,"Best buy is an amazing place to start to get into a technology job. A typical day at work is to sell to customers and try to make a deal. If it's not busy, then you would either help around the store, or try to look busy. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great place to work for a young adult who is into electronics."
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work for the kind of industry it is, as far as pay goes. Stores may not all be equal, however the store I am from plays favorites more than any place Ive ever seen. They like to say, ""its a game of chess and you have to know when and where to move your pieces!"" That is how promotions work in that store unfortunately."
good,"Long hours"
good,jobs invented and changes many time during course of a year changes strategies often
good,"Best buy was a truly fun place to work, however the lack of awareness of thier competitors advancement with online shopping caused the company too many losses and restructuring became a common thing, job security wasnt there."
good,The average work week was 45-50 hours as a part time and i was never offered full time.  I learned a lot about responsibility and how important being truthful was.  After seeing half of a department fired at once that became quite clear.  management needed some tending to.  When I left there were several open HR cases on multiple members of management.  My fellow workers helped me a ton to relieve stress of my position with comic relief and constant corny jokes.  By far the hardest thing about Best Buy was I was expected to complete the work load of two employees every night (I was a closer) and was penalized if the work was not completed.  I finally got HR to look in to it and the expectations were lessened.
good,"Working for Geek Squad is a lot of fun and has a lot of challenges, everyday I get to help people who has difficulty using technology.  My team is very talented and I have shared and learned ideas with them."
good,"What started as a seasonal job, turned into a supervisory role.  Gained excellent work experience even if I wasn't able to completely utilize all the time"
good,Fun place to work with personable management that really know how to treat their employees.
good,"Best Buy has great work values and does a lot to keep there employees happy, and customer service is there number one priority"
good,Geek Squad City has various game rooms and an extensive cafe. Fun to work here the individuals are friendly and professional.
good,What have learned at best buy all the different technology tablets phones cameras laptops computers and video games.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work, with a great corporate campus. The building is beautiful with a great indoor parking ramp so the Minnesota elements stay away from your car. The employees are committed to the future of the company and are excited about the innovation things Best Buy is doing to compete with the marketplace. The new management is doing all that it can to ensure success in the future and it is paying off. Best Buy respects employees personal lives and offers great benefits."
good,"Receive parts as they come in the service center, shipping out damager or not need parts, taking calls from ups and FedEx truck drivers, shipping out miss shipped packages, running parts to the techs, sending emails for short ships and/or part master updates. this is a typical day. I learn that mean work make the dream work. Management get up and work like every one else. my co-workers try to help one another. the hardest part of my job sometimes is others complaining everyday about the same thing. The most enjoyable part of my job time to go home."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  The management, especially at the store level was excellent and this provided for a fun and productive working environment.  Job security, however, was lacking in this job due to the depressed market and over-saturation of Bestbuy and Futureshop stores in the region and Canada-wide."
good,overall amazing company to work for.  Gave me allot of tools and experience that has helped me become the manager that I am today.
good,"Sometimes really slow. "
good,I began this job as a customer service rep and due to my computer experience and skills I was promoted to geek squad
good,"A typical day at work consists of powering on all devices such as tv's, car head units, computers and also making sure everything is functional. Right before open, all co-workers get together in front of the store to go over what the goal is for today and to make sure everyone is on the same page and zoned in areas that can best greet customers in 30 seconds or less. The Gainesville Best Buy employees aways work as a team and are always helping out other coworkers that might not be as knowledgable as the other about that particular product. The hardest part of my job is not really hard at all but I would say making sure that the prices are up to date everyday. The most enjoyable part is being able to show and teach customers about new products and finding the best solution for what they are looking for. Being able to see people leave happy is what really makes me enjoy working directly with customers."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,its an good job. lots of learning opportunities. not as easy to move up in the company though
good,"It was an awesome growth environment allowing personal growth over the years! In the early part of my career, there was some personal sacrifice that had the be made to achieve the level of success needed to grow. Once you achieve that, the sky is the limit!"
good,A typical day at Best Buy would be ringing out customer purchases while providing the best customer service possible. Offering customers a protection plan for their purchased items and a chance to save money by applying for a credit card with Best Buy.  I learned about new items and how technology has evolved. The managers really pushed the employees to do better. I enjoyed my co-workers because many of them were very friendly and always willing to help out. The hardest part of the job was the opportunity to grow because there wasn't room for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity and being able to meeting new people.
good,"Having worked at Best Buy for a year and three months, I found that my experience as a whole truly rested on who my manager was at the time. Having had the same managers for the vast majority of time, I found my experience to be quite... inconsistent. One day, I could love working there, and the next, I could very well hate it. Not because of the job itself, as much as it was the constantly changing moods of the management, depending on who it was that was running the floor. My immediate manager was amazing, always consistently considerate, funny and serious about the job, while other managers clearly had their happiness hinged on whether or not the numbers looked good that hour. That happiness could be stellar one moment, as the sales are going through the roof, while they could be pulling each employee aside to grill them about their depravity the next, as the sales were mediocre. "
good,"Every day offers a new challenge.  With the proper team in place, the work is a joy every day."
good,"stocking and unloading trucks into the warehouse, stocking shelves, adjusting prices on shelves, maintaining a clean warehouse. helping with sales in departments that were short handed"
good,"As a customer representative your responsibilities were to greet every customer, have some knowledge of the products sold in the store, goals set every week on credit card applications, help out throughout the store if not busy and keep registers balanced. It was a friendly and fast paced environment. Great place to work if you're into technology."
good,Management was strong here and I forged some great friendships through my term at Best Buy.  I was in computer sales and while numbers was a strong focus management managed to make the environment fun and interesting for everyone.
good,Best Buy was a great experience. This company has had its struggles throughout the past few years but I learned a wealth of knowledge that has helped me throughout my sales career. As a company the perks are amazing. Best Buy sent me on trips around the nation for trainings and for Achievements. The pay starting out is not the best but on the other foot though the potential for advancement is huge. This company has a tramendous amout of avenues to further your career. Management can be a grueling process for some if you do not know how to performance manage. You have to be on top of your game or the hours become extremely long and it can take a toll. I loved the work enviornment. You defanantly felt like one big huge family with this company.
good,"A typical day revolves around helping customers find the right devices for them, selling Windows' products, and troubleshooting technical issues customers had. I learned a lot about retail, customer service, and product knowledge. Management as Best Buy is a mixed bag, either the managers are absolutely amazing or the stereotypical nightmare boss. The workers at Best Buy are great people and workers, they are there to actually help people and not just push out product. The hardest part of the job would be the customers that are looking to yell at some retail worker. The best part of the job is meeting great people everyday."
good,Wouldn't change the experienced I had learned at Best Buy. Love and hate it but I managed there. Enjoyed the people and the environment even though management wasn't that understandable in some cases. Holidays were a stress and probably the most enjoyable parts were working with the people I loved.
good,"This is your typical retail job. Everything is pretty well scripted. Great of learning systems and following orders. The co-workers are cool. Management is a bit too laid back, but good for self motivated individuals. Everyone expects you to do your job correctly and don't like picking up your slack. Overall a pretty easy job if you do what you're supposed to. "
good,"Working a Best Buy taught me a lot about problem solving, being patient, and my customer service skills greatly improved. My co-workers were very respectful, happy, hard working, and are always willing to help out with what ever necessary. Working at Best Buy was a great experience."
good,"A typical day at work, i have to contact every customer help them find their perfect solution. ive learned alot at Best Buy. When i started i didnt know much about selling skills but now ive worked there for about a year and im pretty confident talking to customers and interacting with people. my co-workers are fun and entertaining. we are like a big family. hardest part at work is dealing with difficult customers but the best part at work is wowing customers and seeing them enjoy their new purchase. "
good,"Making sure we hit revenue and amrgin of service and attachments."
good,"Best Buy overall is a fun place to work with if you're a sociable person. You'll get acquainted with the regular customers, employees, and management and that will make your time there much enjoyable. It is tough when the company is going through an identity crisis though. They don't know what they want to do, thus leading to various restructures which in turn leads to frustration on many levels. Overall, if you're a young college student looking to make some money, Best Buy is fine. If you're trying to move on and grow with your life, Best Buy may hinder your efforts."
good,The company has done some great things and is currently weathering some tough times and making some drastic changes. I have learned a lot about managing and motivating large groups of employees while still being able to focus on individual needs of each one. 
good,"Best Buy has opened my eyes over the years to so many different aspects of business, from selling to interaction with a large team, management roles and responsibilities, to self motivated time, which is the majority of a day for me in the past 6 years. I would never regret a day in my life working here. From shipping and receiving boxes in late 1999 to working at the board level of electronics, I have truly found my passion. I want to continue my career in electronics in my pursuit of a new career in an all encompassing role with electronics."
good,"This company makes its employees very knowledgeable about all its prodcuts. It stands behind the employees despite it being a retail store, and the customer is not always right in their eyes."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,This a good place to grow up in the retail world especially if you like change. The work environment is different depending on the management team at the store you work at because they have have the ability to adjust the rules according to their style as long as they remain within certain guidelines.
good,helping customers. installing mobile electronic equipement. some home theater installaion also. planograms. warehouse work
good,"Enjoyed coworkers, and customers."
good,"great company to work for, the company lives up to its standard of having fun while being the best."
good,"I started off selling computers, but they found out how much I knew about them and promoted me to a CIA. I had an enjoyable experience and learned quite a bit. Management team acted as if they couldn't care less about the employees though."
good,"For all the Six years I worked for this company i really can't say anything. The store i worked at was less then exceptional due to lack of respect from management. Mainly the Store GM, and the Floor Managers. No one was happy to work there, but with the recession looming over the economy, no one wanted to bring it to the attention of HR. Other stores i visited everyone got along and ideas were able to be exchanged and flourish in profit."
good,It was an easy job but it was very physical.
good,"This job was great, however they pretty much are on a favorable status. Overall this company is a amazing company that I would love too work for once again."
good,It was always a fun day to go into work and talk with the customers that came through and getting to know them for future visits. I was around things of my interest with technology.
good,"I worked for the company around 6 years while i was finishing up my degree in college and a couple of years afterwards. I worked in the warehouse which involved handing majority of the merchandise that flowed through the store. Detailed was given to accurately receiving merchandise into inventory and product placement. It was a controlled environment, but attention was still given to loss prevention. Helped customers as we walked the floor and carried big items like washer/dryers and tv's to customers vehicles."
good,Get ready to work every weekend and holiday. Otherwise great compensation and leadership advancement.
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work. I learned many things about selling from them, and I would definitely work there again."
good,meeting new people and getting learn new things while making hard earned money.
good,Handled difficult clients but supervisors were avaible to help in anyway possible
good,"Typical day of work consisted of interacting with customers, providing demos for products and handling cash register. Also learning about new technologies coming through."
good,Many mornings we would start with games either in the parking or in the store before it opened...opened up people to meet others. That was a great tool
good,I was only working here to help during the Christmas holidays. It was a fast-paced environment with good training methods.
good,Love working in the sales industry with customers and helping customers figure out decisions in their life. Love retail sales. Low pay
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Huge focus on employee experience and growth within the company. Pay is good once you get promoted.
good,"The management at the SLO Store in San Luis Obispo are all great and the employee discount can’t be beat, but the pay for the average worker there isn’t very good and would be hard to live on"
good,"Very fun and productive and easy job when store is in order. Typical days require brief sign changes, down-stocking, and changing planograms. Lots to learn at this company"
good,Every changing and they keep taking and raising requirements to hit bonuses...  I love the culture and the people the job and GEEK squad services are 2nd to none.
good,"Not a bad place to work,great coworkers bosses r alittle lost at times but I would recommend it for a decent job. Only reason I left is being I left the area."
good,Fast pace driving standup forklift for eight hours a day. Heavy lifting at times. How to work in a fast pace environment. Management was OK. Very diverse culture. Using a RF scanner throughout the work day.
good,Best Buy is a quick paced job depending on what you apply for and what you end up doing. The time I did work for them I loved the job that I did but it did get stressful at time because of the high volume and the unorganization.
good,"The work was easy and the customers were difficult but easy to handle but the workers were not professional at all. Going to work, the customers made my day, surviving my coworkers."
good,"Mornings were usually slow, picked up in afternoons. I learned about interactions between sales and customer relations. Culture was great with one's fellow workers. The busiest times of day were a bit taxing. I loved learning about the newest gadgets and appliances."
good,"Great place for a first job,they will help you move up and provide you with the resources if you ask for them.I got offered a much better salary which is why I left but the managers were great the environment  is family oriented.If it payed more I would of stayed."
good,It was fun at first but then you were told to just sell credit cards more than you are to sell actual products. Management was quick good. Schedule was rough
good,"I had a great time when I first arrived to Best Buy. The environment was great and the people were better, but then the management started to get on top of us. We were all selling in the green (over 100%) and the assistant sales manager (he has never spent a single day on the sales floor) just tells us what to do with no guidance what so ever. This was the same with most of the managers in Best Buy."
good,A typical day is like any other retail store. Your coworkers become your friends kind of thing. The hardest part of the job is black Friday because the store gets really busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is to sell cutting edge technology.
good,"Great place to work, my overall experience with the employees was great. Everyone there has a great sense of fun, including the managers. The fall of this job comes when each sales associate or other positions alike are pressured consistently by their managers to reach numbers that only benefit them and corporate. Workers such as the sales consultants at the bottom of the food chain rarely get any of the profit the company makes. Employee discounts are nice but were mostly on cables from my experience. Sometimes the annual accommodations made up for it."
good,"Great discounts, pretty good pay. Can be fun, however in my personal experience the management is very double sided and the store guidelines for certain procedures are flawed."
good,Fun and friendly work environment and fast-paced. Knowledgeable and helpful employees. The overall atmosphere is learning conducive and productive in a fun friendly style and they take care of their people and customers.
good,"In my position, there wasn't a very good work life balance. Stock options were great. Good benefits, but expensive. Won't do much for you if you get injured."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Best Buy. It can, and usually was, a great place to meet new friends and work hard. I worked in merchandising for several years and was rewarded several times for my hard work."
good,Very nice place to work at and fun amazing people but they only gave me 4 hours a week which was not enough also no commission even though i sold alot of stuff.
good,my only real issue with bestbuy is the feeling that higher level management in the company are drastically disconnected from the every day associates.
good,"Great place to work, fantastic people. Favorite part is interacting with the clients every day. Workplace culture in Geek Squad is amazing but you can see how it lacks in the sales floor. Management is okay, we could all be better people however. A typical day at work is you working with clients, finding solutions, and hopefully doing your best to make them happy."
good,"It was a great place to work for, really made it enjoyable then through out the years turned its focus on what, How much, and accessories you are selling."
good,I just feel that the protection level should be stronger within the company. really good company to work for & great line of products. wish people would stop stealing and just buy.
good,Working at Best Buy was amazing to be with all of the latest technology. Employees always strived to be better than the next and we kept a great rapport with our customers.
good,"Typical Day - Review the Appointment Schedules and prepare accordingly"
good,Great place to work if you already have money. Best Buy is one of the best place I have ever worked but the main issue here is not getting paid enough. Minimum wage is not what you want if you work at best buy.
good,Overall good experience with people within the store. Promote team environment. Unhappy with some of corporates policies.  Not bad as a part time job.
good,"The culture and the work itself were decent. The pay rate was low and not within a living wage. Aside from local management, I enjoyed Best Buy. Even when management was committing fraudulent acts, corporate HR handled everything professionally and promptly."
good,"Working for geeksquad for me I worked in the back, and you think you repair pcs and you do, but your are constantly interrupted by client calls, the CA should be the ones taking the calls but it can sometimes get hectic but you'll still manage, I learned a lot about hardware and software with GeekSquad and you will too, I feel though you can make more at another job doing the same thing, plus asking for hours you'll never get them, you can't survive, good job."
good,"It is good place to work, good experience to learn from makes you feel like home with good bonding with managers and employees they also have good benefits for employees"
good,"I assisted with Best Buy everyday vendor requests, as well as Infrastructure daily health checks. This was an internship contracted position. Which led me to learn a lot, but unfortunately had an end date."
good,Overall a good place to work. Management could have been better. It was fun working with a variety of people and smart people at that. Holidays were always super busy.
good,"Work includes clocking in, answering questions and troubleshooting issues with consumer electronics. Management will typically do a check in and let you know the days focus, throughout the day they will blast the current company metrics compared to the rest of the district. The workplace culture is top notch, it really attracts some great people. constant food parties and other things to reward hard work. hardest part of the job is just the retail clientel. Best part of the job is the cohesive team work that is constantly involved in day to day operation -"
good,I sold TV on the floor so I interacted with customers a great deal. I upsold and created add on's when people needed the extra. I stocked and used the computer system very well. Additionally  answered phones and worked in the geek squad for a period of time.
good,"Some days are better than others. When sale are good. the tone is good. when sales are down, the tone is negative towards employees."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Although Best Buy is a overall good, stable company. Team leaders and management expect a lot out of employees with hardly anything to return. There is no commission although you are selling the companies products as well as extra insurance. Sometimes managers don't learn your name. But the"
good,"Everyone is committed to doing their jobs, and management enforces basic rules and decisions. We always help each other when needed, and we stay positive and support our team. "
good,This was a good place.  I love electronics very much.  I been using them for years. But I am very interested in that upper field in that area.  But I'm be in the electrical field.
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for with many benefits. There are plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. The overall experience depends on location and the management team at the particular location. The best buy culture that is created by the company is great.
good,"Great place to work, advancement is difficult and takes quite sometime.  My coworkers where the best part of the job for me, great group of people that where fun to work with."
good,Job and duties were ok. Upper management was terrible. I did however learn a lot more about technology and gained a lot of certifications. Good work environent.
good,"fun work place and good benefits. met a lot of friends there. typical work day would usually be a steady pace, always had something to do. my favorite thing to do there was the ad set."
good,"must be committed to work, hit your goals, be friendly to customers and employees. will be paid well, have to lend a helping hand to different departments."
good,The place was great at first the management got comfortable and never focus on my career advancement only their own goals. Your co workers may be the nicest part of best buy there is always a huge team and everyone has somewhere they fit in
good,"Lack of hours was my biggest concern at Best Buy. I was hired in around August, a few months before Black Friday and my manager told me that I would be getting 20-25 hours per week which I requested. Hours were great until after Christmas, there was plenty of employees, however not enough hours. I now only average about 4 hours a week. When I have rent to pay and school to attend like I told my manager, I find it very difficult to convince myself to stay with Best Buy for any longer."
good,"Best Buy was a great job that lead to other opportunities. The work environment was fast paced, constantly interacting with customers. The people there were great and a pleasure to work with. The pay isn't competitive unless you're in management but it is a great place to be to get working experience."
good,Fun but challenging you have to make sure you stay on your toes when doing your work because it's very easy to break the rules and end up fired but can still be fun to work there.
good,I do not feel the need to fill this out. I do not like that this part is required. This is a publicly traded company. Anything you need to know can be found online.
good,"Best buy was a great job for me...lots of opportunity for advancement, and it was fun working with electronics, always got to see the latest and greatest products first"
good,"had fun at this job, a lot of other employees. everyone got along. nice having a not as strict atmosphere. managers were all very nice. learned a lot about technology"
good,"great place to be, working e=inventory was always fun. great people pay was ok could have been better for that position. but the overall learning experience was great"
good,Working with best buy was amazing. I was a customer service specialist and it was a great opportunity to work with customer over the phone. You get the weird ones who ask questions but other times you get those who want to really buy something. All in all it is a pretty good company to work for.
good,"Nothing particularly negative to say but nothing particularly positive either.  In my instance, I had good leadership and a good set of coworkers, but nothing stood out as exceptional."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a good, stable company to work for. The knowledge needed for everyday work is easily taught, and there is definitely opportunity for advancement if warranted."
good,"Lots of employees and supervisors are extremely rude. Most won't help or take the time to explain what needs to be done , and if you are new, they show you once with a walk around then you most figure the rest out on your own."
good,Regular Sales Job. Very busy on weekends so it makes time go by fast. I learned to multitask. There is always someone willing to help you out with any troubles you might have.
good,"- typical day is attending customers with returns and exchanges."
good,"I liked working there, however, we had to work late after we closed because the manager was to caught up on computer and would not dismiss anyone.  We would be there about 2 hours more that we should"
good,"Really a decent place but the management at times leaves you wanting. The department in which you begin working there will really depict your pay and whether or not you move up in the company. "
good,"Nice atmosphere and some great benefits! Has a very nice workforce and provides health, dental, and vison. Get paid time off and also paid holidays. Good company."
good,Great company to start your sales career. Learning curve is steep but if you can master these selling skills you can advance in other likewise careers.
good,Boring management is not good they was never in the store and never helped with employees issues they would go on lunch when there the only manger inside the store
good,"What makes working for Best Buy awesome is the people and the experience with new technology. Day to day work includes cleaning, downstocking and interacting with customers."
good,"First working as a salesman was great except for the company REALLY pushed sales, I didn't like selling a product I didn't feel was a right fit for the customer."
good,"Great place to advance in the company. Great customer service."
good,Great sales place to work at but not secure with Hours. Find a second job of possible. Hours go down tremendously after the major holidays and sometimes you will not get put on schedule. Great company to exercise your people skills and learn about sales.
good,It was a fun environment to work in and everyone is very friendly. The job itself was interesting and it was nice helping people. A lot is expected for little pay and no commission.
good,great place to work. Loved the 3 years i spent there. I did not like my co-workers except for a select few because they were lazy and did not do thier job correctly and it make it very hard to stick around. the managment was unable to do anything about the  lack of work ethics so i left.
good,"Working as the Multi-Channel Sales Associate was stressful. The people and (some) managers I worked with made the job amazing, but not good enough for me to stay, because it sucked most days."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great place to work when you are not working during the holidays. You get to see new and excitement electronics. You get to meet new people all the time.
good,"Working part time at geek squad has provided me with a wealth of customer support experience and communication skills. It has taught me how to put technological terms into terms that your average Joe can understand. The management has been great, and I have no complaints in that regard. My co-workers in the repair field are great, however some of them on the customer facing side need serious evaluation. They are good at selling, but have very little knowledge when it comes to actual technical issues. The hardest part of the job is explaining to clients, or our other employees who are not as knowledgeable as they should be, what the issues are and how to fix them. Once you convey that information, however; there is no greater feeling in the world than seeing the satisfied look on a clients face once they understand their issue, and how to fix it. The one major complaint I have about the job is that they need ti be hiring people who have actual technical knowledge, and not just sales experience."
good,"When it gets busy, it gets busy. At times its like there are no shoppers, however sometimes there seems to be an endless stream of people. The employees and managers are really ""chill"" its a fun place to work if meet all the goals."
good,best buy has a lot of favoritism.  the managers are selfish. they don't give enough hours and its not what i expected. it doesn't matter how hard you work you won't get anywhere .
good,its fun. new tech is always cool to look at. sometimes it gets boring because the store is empty. I think there should be more company outings and contest to keep motivation.
good,"I learned about the latest technology and skills required to suggest products to customer. Very fun and enjoyable place to work. However, management only concerned with numbers and just judge based of that."
good,"I've loved working at the Best Buy Chilliwack location. The management is sincerely interested in their employees and their long term goals and is flexible with positions, and hours. "
good,Introduce yourself to customer.  Ask open ended questions for what the customer wants.  Assist them with everything they want.  Fallow through with the sale to make sure there needs were met.
good,I like best buy but didn't car for the location. under staff and lots of responsibility to take on for just a worker. need more managers who want to work
good,Working at  best buy was a very fun and productive workplace. I met a great deal of people and learned fun new ways to improve my selling skills.
good,"Some days are busy others are slow.Learn to operate a variety of machines and training is provided by the company.Mostly all the Managers are great,helpful and supportive.The co-workers are great people."
good,This company is very flexible and always let me put school first.  The management was great and truly wanted to promote their employees.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my role at EGS as a trainer for Best Buy. Each day would begin with unlocking the potential for agents to become the best that they could possibly be. My team was enjoyable and the challenge of staying up to date with the new material was something I also enjoyed. "
good,Fun workplace with very supportive team members and management. It is more about of improving and personally grow rather than numbers or productions. Working with my colleagues is really fun and enjoyable because I am learning from them through their experiences.
good,"The company is great, gives great training and lots of room for moving around in different sections and learning many different things. "
good,It is a good company that will reward their employees for certain things.Its a hot job but rewarding if you do the job correctly
good,A very productive and user friendly place to work and a good area. It is a good place to work and has flexible schedules. A very enjoyable place to work.
good,Fun place to work if you love technology and people. The people that come to the store are general nice and want help. I loved engaging with them and the current store I worked at was full of motivation. Great people and great friends were made at my location.
good,"Training was great, and the staff was great too. Don't get me wrong, it was a decent job, but I felt that it was to much work for the pay it gave it's employees for this particular position."
good,very diverse in experiences from the costumers to the management almost like a family of sorts in some locations and a machine in others.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Its a fun job but very little opportunity to advance and management changes often."
good,"Working for Best Buy offers a great balance. The flexibility of your schedule is great. The pay is not the greatest but it is a give and take relationship. While it may be hard to move up in the company, if you are okay with working a mediocre lifestyle, you'll be good."
good,"This job was very rewarding to me, I learned A LOT about many different things. I didn't know much about computers/printers etc.. coming in to the store, and in less then a months I was Rookie of the month and was promoted to a computer specialist. "
good,"Great working environment, I have the opportunity learn about the latest and greatest devices all in one location. I work with some of the best co-workers that have great knowledge of the products that they are selling. The hardest part of my job is the language barrier with customers from other countries. The most enjoyable part of my job are associates, great discounts and the out store bonus."
good,"Fun work day but found myself lost when it came to a few things because of a lack in training. The communication between the managers, supervisors and others was horrible."
good,watch for shrink theft get to know the people you work with the hardest part is you have to be on your feet for 9 + hours a day without being able to sit
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Best Buy. The management staff have made it easy for me to balance school and work. However, job security is non-existent due to company wide cuts."
good,"very easy work, you load tractor trailers with boxes to be sent out to best buy stores. The hours are great, it has a/c, but the worst part is its only a seasonal job. The workers are friendly and you learn to drive forklift there and how to stock chase."
good,"Daily Stock Counts"
good,"A good place to work, made a lot of personal and business connections.  Hard to develop a career currently with all the struggles the company is going through.  Most enjoyable part of the job is all the interaction and training with individuals."
good,Great company but with it management issues and constant restructures it lack advancement and stability
good,"Back when I joined Best Buy in 2002, the opportunities were immense.  When I joined the Project team, it was a dream come true, lots of hours, don't have to sell, and learn new things.  My whole team was started up the same day I joined, so we got to know one another very much.  Then as 2012 rolled around, we were seeing no advancement, our pay was capped, the jobs were either too small, ie little pay, or so much we were getting stressed out over things as simple as telling us what we were doing, even the corporate levels were changing things daily, making us go back and re-do work from days before."
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday for this company. A typical day involved answering customers questions about the latest mobile technology, operating the cash register and navigating the computer programs of the largest mobile carriers in order to set up customers with a new line of service or to upgrade their existing accounts."
good,I think Best Buy has it's pros and cons.  I really enjoyed the culture of the company itself.  They often rewarded hard work with bonuses and recognition.  Unfortunately the staff have a tendency to bring the company down.  Unprofessional management with a lack of a common goal.
good,"Best But is a place that is constantly changing, you have to keep up with a lot of changes."
good,"I love customer service when it comes to electronics, having my day filled with this made my job fun and interesting. I'm always up for learning new things and this job gave me some of that. Management was pretty nice, and my co-workers were the type of people i very much enjoy spending my time with. The hardest part of the job was the end of the day, getting stuck there because it was the holiday season and people don't go home. The best part was feeling like i could share my knowledge with someone else."
good,"Best Buy is truly fun to work at, however, work hours are way too mimimized, only real benefit is the employee's discount and due to the low work hours given to the company's employees (blue shirts and yellow shirts) is measly which leads to a rich - fulfilling personal life. Management is more like motivational personalities and parent like figures to me."
good,Proactively promoted company products while providing excellent customer service to customers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Some great Employees, pretty good pay, some good managers, but watch what you do. Some do show favoritism. Also watch some employees, they will act as if they care but will really be out to get you. Very sneaky."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Best Buy. it is a great company passionate about growing and changing especially in this tough economy. The balance between customer service and business I feel is its biggest challenge because at what point do you draw the line while at the same time make sure the customer has recieved that extra mile?
good,This was a great job with incredible people however with the economy failing adjustments had to be made and lay offs happened.
good,Worked here in college for a few years. It was fun and the management made it a challenge. They were nice and always had our backs. Learned sales very quickly.
good,"I enjoyed my job. Mostly because I was good at it. On any given day I'd meet interesting people with different views on life and it would also be interesting to hear about how they felt about a certain brand or product in comparison to how another customer would feel about the same thing. The management was good for the most part. and The hardest part about the job was the actual sale itself. You can't sell the same way to everybody and being able to make one customer understand something using a different method than you used for the previous customer, may be the hardest part. I really learned how to be patient more than anything, everyone won't say yes the first time."
good,Great opportunities to advance.  Great learning experience.
good,"It's retail. You sell to customers, whatever you can. It can get very overwhelming when it gets busy, but can be fun working with the employees."
good,I learned a lot of leadership skills working at Best Buy and it was a fun place to work. There are a lot of different areas of the store to specialize in and I specialized in operations. Loved it!
good,"You can expect a loose, fun filled experience with Best Buy. Just not enough pay"
good,"If I would have reviewed this place before the new store manager had arrived, there would not be one 3 star rating. After he took over and took the extra time to straighten out the managers and moved everyone to the same page it was an amazing place to work. Managers were not contradicting themselves every hour and associate moral went way up. The customer reviews reflected this change and I would recommend this place to work. Only reason there are not 5 star reviews across the board is because a few supervisors/managers do not know the first thing about managing effectively. In general, amazing place to work."
good,Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas
good,gr8 pace to work
good,it was a fun place to work at i had fun and you can move up in the company everyone is friendly and always learning something new with technology
good,"A typical day at work with Best Buy includes constant customer service as well as fun interactions with coworkers. It is a great place to work if you start at an early age as it tends to take a long time to get anywhere within the company that pays a decent wage, but coming in as a middle aged person it can be pretty frustration, especially if it is your first retail experience."
good,provide great customer service
good,it was a pretty easy job but long hours of standing in one spot doing the same thing over and over
good,Customer Service
good,"A typical day at work is starting off doing yesterday's deposit and counting the safe, then putting out all the registers. Then depending on what day it is depends on the tasks I do for the day. I check our application system 3 times a week, our store problems 3 times a week, I order money 2 times a week, I order supplies 1 day a week, and doing learning lounges on my down time. That is a few things I do during a typical day. I have learned many things with dealing with cash and paying bills for a company. I have also learned to take inventory of the supplies needed and order. The hardest part of my job is learning how to balance my time to be able to get everything done that I need to in a day. My work plus the work the managers give me to do on any given day. The part I enjoy the most are the people I work with."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is having fun while assisting customers, which is our number one prority. In fact, I learn everyday from my loyal customers that tell me what they are interested in purchasing from our store. Be that as it may, our floor managers are always interacting with employees as it relates to our daily goals and objectives. The hardest thing about my job is trying to serve everyone without letting a customer walk out the store not being helped. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my associates and meeting new and interesting people everyday."
good,Having to make a budget every day was Lot of fun! Getting to have a department that I helped run and get it to Number 3 in the whole company was very rewarding.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I really like working here. I am now a college grad, and I need to make more money."
good,Being productive and being updated for newer technology that arrives. Will keep customers inform as to what accuring to the repair of their sets
good,Best Buy is great to work for because they will work with you if your in school and or if you have a bad personal experience. The only store I wouldnt work in is Valdosta they have to much favortisem and if you do call out with a medical problem they will write you up. That store has no real direction and you can't move up with that store at all and everyone always quits or transfers to a new store
good,"Best Buy would be a career job if they did not want to pay you minimum wage to do high-end commission sales work. The business model is sort of a scam that takes advantage of young employees or want an ""in"" into the tech industry."
good,Atmosphere is nice. You deal with people from all walks of life which helps you to learn the needs and the wants of the public. I would recommend this job to anyone starting their career in Customer Service.
good,I believe that my sales position here has helped me understand the grind that is required in order to be a sales representative. I was taught with a training course that built me up from being a new hire and it has carried through my whole two years at the store. I enjoyed my time here as my employers and co-workers were very relatable and kind people.
good,"I love working at best buy. There was always something for me to do, i enjoyed the customers that came in. The company teaches you everything and helps you succeed. I left Best Buy for a career move and they helped me and also reassured me that i will always have a place to come back to."
good,"It would be very helpful for yourself to be able to sell electronics and work in the warehouse department of the store for example or be a customer service rep and a greeter to the store. The more skills you offer, especially about electronics, the more hours you'll be provided with."
good,"Built a good rapport with coworkers as well as customers."
good,"I only left for higher compensation. Pros? You get to work with friendly people on electronics! Great training for professional/enterprise environments. You will get the opportunity to lift, bend, stoop, and squat. Bonuses happen when performance is up, which was really nice! Cons?? Mostly just rude customers. I will say, breaks need to be more available to geek squad employees in my experience. Sometimes I wouldn't get to sit or eat on my shift. The job can be stressful; it is not for the week of heart."
good,"The company culture is best for young, healthy people that are okay being on their feet for 12+ hours per day. "
good,In my time at best buy i was able to learn very valuable skills as well as life lessons that has helped me in my career. I will always value Best Buy and their management at the time for setting me up for success.
good,My store had a family-like mentality. Most workers were energetic and passionate about costumer service. The managers continued to develop themselves and the workers throughout the years. I enjoyed working at Best Buy and will miss it.
good,"To be honest, I didn't know much about electronics when I first started there, but it is an excellent place to start learning. "
good,Not a bad place to work if you are comfortable in sales. Just collaberate with other to help the department and store.  Everyone wants to be a winner so team up and help eachother
good,"Very good benefits, training for employees available and recommended.  Job advancement opportunity, management very helpful, team player work environment.  Positive work atmosphere"
good,"Easy going work place, busy during holiday seasons. Strong push to sell GSP and other incentives. Management is not the best. Co-workers are nice to be around."
good,great for learning about it they have some many partners that the work with that for a college student looking to get a abase level understanding they will get that from best buy
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was only going to work for seasonal, but my performance during the seasonal position was heavily favored which they offered me a part-time position. Afterward, I felt as if I wanted to pursue my degree to get a job I'm highly interested in which is in computers.  The people at best buy are very approachable and nice, at least the one I worked at."
good,"Love the people, love the benefits of getting 184 PTO after 5 years of employment, starting PTO is 144. The job isn't difficult but the pay sucks. If I was getting paid over $18 per hr I would stay. I never used my health care so I can't vouch for it. Management are really nice and mostly don't have egos."
good,Training was pretty well done. I do not think i'd return due to the culture at my particular store. I do believe you need to be able to hustle and if you can't this is not the job for you.
good,The people I worked with were the best part of the job. Fun and exciting culture to be in.Getting to work on a variety of different tasks and responsibilities made the work fresh and inviting every day.
good,taught me a lot about other peoples feelings and showed a lot of leadership throughout. Very fast paced work days also very stressful at times where you would need a second opinion. Hardest part was when there was no solutions to costumers problems
good,The Best Buy I worked for was full of favoritism and that was typically the basis for promotion.  Pay and benefits were great and the work was easy.  Discounts on accessories were great.
good,"The atmosphere is great and so were the people as well. There was tons of physical labor for low pay. "
good,"This retails story gives you the tools to have all the knowledge to understand and sell the right product to each individual, you just have to put the effort. If you just want to punch the clock, work at a fast food joint, At Best Buy, the right recommendation puts a smile of the whole families face for years."
good,Great place to work and learn business acumen. Unfortunately I have been laid off twice with the company. Great place to work just not as stable. Would recommend others working here.
good,"Small Store, we were one big family and pretty relaxed around co-workers. Great discounts and accommodations.  Worked Geek Squad mainly. Warehouse during holidays, and filled in for Customer Service, Home Delivery, Sales Floor.  Left due to getting poor hours as a part timer. (10 hour weeks with full availability) A lot of Improvements could be done to the store I worked at."
good,"goodemployer fun job, great custoerm meet a lot of new people, good for collage student are fpr a seconf job, mangment is much better now from the time I was employed"
good,"Good place to work.  Friendly atmosphere.  Room for advancement, depends on you, of course.  Starting shift is very early.  Must be flexible with your work/personal schedule."
good,If you can stay motivated to sale without commission its a great place to work.  Not a very stressful job unless its holiday season. If you put in the work and show results you will move up.
good,"My time at Best Buy was a great learning experience in work ethic and time management. My favorite part was getting to develop professional friendships with my fellow employees. My only qualm was at the General Management level. Sometimes it felt the opinions of the lower workers were not heard or trusted at the upper management level, and at times, reflected poorly on the lower workers to the customer. Which the customer service relationship is key to maintaining a profitable and stable business relationship. But, all in all, my time at Best Buy was a fantastic working experience."
good,They were cool man no complaints with the employment just low hours at first great benefits and great discounts is always a plus. some drama but what work place doesn't have that
good,"Geek squad used to be great but are now outsourcing to overseas going against company culture and values.  After 13 years of loyal service they are moving my job overseas to save a little money in the one area of the company that has kept Best Buy alive, this will be the death of Best Buy and with it geek squad"
good,Best Buy is a great job for students who just transitioning into college. However a lot of the time your are stuck waiting around for customers to come through.
good,For the job that is given it is fun and enjoyable. Very laid back place and yet still hard work. Although not many opportunities are given and has low pay. Not many benefits as well.
good,The best thing about working here is the people you get to meet every day. Whether there from the US or other countries it's amazing to meet new people and here there stories. Management has goals to be met you have goals to be met. Just do your best and you will be successful in this company.
good,"Best part about working here was that it was non commissioned sales. So you did not feel pressured when speaking with a customer to make a sale. The department and the store still had sales goals, but it felt easier in trying to meet them when you knew you were not on commission and felt you had to make every sale"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Nice company but not enough pay. If you're in school and need something temporary then this is a great company to work for. Just depending on which store you work for will depend if you'll grow.
good,"Es buena tienda "
good,It is a very friendly work envoirnoment and all emplyee work together as a team when tackeling customers questions ans concerns.
good,It's a great place to get a good start in the field. The salary is decent the work atmosphere is great and people are pleasant. There is a lot of favoritism. Initially your offered 2nd shift.
good,"It was very friendly and easy going, but it just wasn't for me. Recommended for people who like working in a electronic type of store. I would rather work in a restaurant or a different type of retail service. But the staff was great and their work policies are great as well."
good,"Very good company to work for, great benefits for you and your family. Your work is based off production, meaning how may items you can pick in a certain time."
good,"Best Buy can be fun, but it is taxing with management that is still novice to their role. Also, you are working with individuals that are sometimes immature, so that is also horrible as well."
good,I felt Best Buy was a great place to work. The Company was restructured and many changes occurred that I could adapt to. Time off became a problem for everybody and we lost alot of great employees.
good,"My days consisted of either Cashier or Sales Operator for the day as they were assigned to me. As Cashier I did a lot of cash handling, customer check out and credit card applications. As Sales Operator I helped with any research the supervisors needed help with. High call volumes for all phone lines, delegating calls if need be to the proper departments. Helping customers with both in store and over the phone online orders."
good,Easy going environment with the biggest selection of technology. Decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected of a big company. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.
good,"Cashing out customers, greeting, answering any questions or concern they might have and directing them to where they need to go."
good,Everyone is friendly and good to work with. Learned how to work in a retail environment. Management is great. The job was easy. Enjoyed working with the team the most.
good,"Most enjoyable part as a sales consultant is giving customers an at ease shopping experience, by educating the customer/s on the latest and greatest devices!"
good,This can be a wonderful place to work so long as you have a drive and passion for technology and customer support. Here you are given the tools to learn and understand and the tools provided are near limitless.
good,"As a Best Buy worker I learned to always strive to do your best and as long as you know its your best even if it isn't the best way everyone else would have done it, it will still bring about great outcomes."
good,"Gossip in workplace, management frude with other employees, loved co-workers, new learning experience, loved greeting and meeting new customers"
good,"Assisted sales manager in leading, directing and motivating the sales team in order to achieve the overall corporate sales objectives"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked at BestBuy for almost a year, and it was great at first but the managers started getting a bit pushy and very demanding. My store in particular had a lot ""favoritism"" which really really bugged me! the wrong people got promotions just for be good friends with the GM, in my opinion credit should be given where its due not to your favorites specially working for such a big company. Sometimes, the schedules would be off and even times occurred where i didn't receive a lunch break. My co workers were great, and the pay was also not that bad."
good,Working at Best Buy Corporate was a great experience.  The people that I worked with were always most helpful.  That could be seen throughout the company
good,"starting early in the morning calling customers with eta,then performed the route as organized ending the day completing all papers work."
good,"Best buy was a very fun work place, They trained you very well before you actually got on the sales floor. They sent you to classes for a week and a test to evaluate your skills. My manager was to fast pace, never really talked to you one on one, My supervisors Were amazing, they recongnized you for your good work and told you whatyou were doing wrong. Co workers had your back when you needed them and made work fun. The hardest part of my job was to make sure we hit are revenue for the day, sometimes there wasnt enough people in the store to hit. The most enjoyable part of my job at Best Buy was when you made a persfect match for the customers, knowing they were happy with the product was the best feeling"
good,"Shift work, highly adaptive, and a will to please and excell are some skills you must have to work there."
good,"I liked coming into work because I liked to communicate with others. Working with bestbuy, I got to meet lots of great people and was able to share them my knowledge about electronics. Even on my days off, I would come into work because I liked the work enviornment. I always even called work to find out if I can come in to work. The management was pretty decent but when we finally got a new GM, everything went uphill for us. He really motivated us and we became strong as a team. I will never forget bestbuy."
good,I loved working for Best Buy because of the people that would come in as customers. Helping them made my job worth while. The only problem that I had was that there where never enough hours.
good,"• I was a sales associate in charge of selling many electronics such as but not limited to movies, cameras, computers and video games. I was also in charge of the register and handling cash, checks, debit and credit cards."
good,"Manager on duty consists of being the floor lead, settling disputes, and making smart business decisions in terms of sales. Responsible for helping out customers and making sales presentations. Also responsible for guiding other sales associates towards completing tasks."
good,"Best Buy is a good company and the location I worked at had good management. My job required me to do safety checks, count display items, enforce all rules on employees including management, evaluate numbers from theft, and be great at multitasking."
good,"I worked in best buy mobile, which is one of the most high pressure sales environments ever. I am a competitive, but not cut throat person. We were expected to sell our product to customers who didn't need and weren't interested. Honestly, a person looking at camcorders doesn't want a new cell phone plan. I was also often bored because there wasn't enough to do. My coworkers were nice, but I often felt excluded because I'm not part of the party scene. The pay was great but I'm glad my health required me to quit."
good,"Lets see, if you are lucky enough to have a good manager you can count yourself among the lucky ones...But more likely then not you will be lacking in some other aspect such as workers who don't do their job, supervisors who micro manage and keep you doing ""busy work."" Generally customers are nice and well meaning but there are always the difficult ones who will blame you for their entire experience. This job is about a 50-50 good to bad on any given day."
good,This job is a stepping stone job. Best Buy has flexible hours and great training. Management is encouraging and will back you up when you need them...
good,"Best Buy struggles to keep up with online retail stores, and pushes it's sales assosiates to sell more in order to make up for lost revenue numbers. Its a very stressful work environment"
good,"I am a Merchandising Specialist at Best Buy. The main point of the job is to make the store a clean, organized, fun trip for the customer. The merch team sets Planograms to Corporate's standards, downstocks and lazer-lines shelves for the convenience of customers and employees, sets up, tests, and fixes demos, and keeps the warehouse clean and organized."
good,"Very fun place to work, coworkers and team culture is amazing here. The one negative thing is that sometimes your coworkers will get caught up in all the ""fun"" and slack off."
good,"good customer service, but don't really feel that welcoming. The management is a little crooked some are usually on break most of the times when needed to help out a customer."
good,I sold water to fires if I had too than sold sand to the beach when the time was right. Working at best Buy was a great experience learned a lot from the great team around me
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Great job for the fun loving person who doesn't mind a challenge. Finding solutions for people who aren't always in the mood to hear what you have to say, but seeing the moment you make someone's day or salvage a teen date night gone wrong, finding that perfect gift for the picky grandkid and having a customer refuse to work with anyone but you makes up for it. Customers remember my name and I get to know them and their families all while enjoying a tech geeky culture and fun atmosphere. No other place I have worked has had ""having fun while being the best"" in their core mission statement and they mean it."
good,Best Buy is very flexible with their employees and those that are in school.  They really work around their employees to make sure that their schedules will work with their day to day lives.
good,super super super good and stuff ya it was cool and stuff then we sentit to the store and i worked and it was a  good day and then i stopped wroking there
good,"Flexible working hours, but no set schedule. Not required to meet a sales quota, but were pressured to meet a goal. Monthly / quarterly bonus was awarded if goals were met. Management encouraged a friendly work atmosphere, which helped keep the stress down. The great discounts were also a perk."
good,It was a nice place to work .It was always clean. Employees were well rounded in most areas. A typical day was selling products and assisting guests. And they had all the latest technology.
good,Good job and extensive training.  A lot of politics with the advancement away from the sales floor into tech support.  The bosses vary drastically but if you put in the work most of them are cool.
good,Great culture and fun workplace. Busy all day with customers. Great management and employee training. Bad hourly wage and no commission diminishes employee enthusiasm.
good,"Very competitive job, book reading with one another maybe the job fun everything tried to shoot to for the highest sale for the week, and holidays were the roughest of them all"
good,"Despite the fact that other people in the store acts too bossy, BestBuy store (1091) is a family. The store manager is their mom and everyone else is a cousin, brother or uncle to each other. No, I wasn't blood related to anyone in the store but, they work place and the environment at store 1091 felt like family."
good,Travailler dans une très belle ambiance et très bonne communication entre les employés.
good,everyday you learn something new by sailing product to customers whether it is something you have no attentions on using or if you know about the product.
good,I loved working at Best Buy and selling televisions. I learned all about televisions and the cool new features. My coworkers were great and loved working with all of them. The management was great as well and they were very helpful with things. The hardest part of the job was sometimes learning all of the new things that were coming out that were new and we did not have any experience with any of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to sell televisions and see the customers reaction when they learned something new.
good,A good place to work that treats their employees well.  Advancement comes quickly if you are willing to work hard to achieve your goals and want to move up
good,"strong culture to believe in, work hard for people to work with."
good,I advanced in a quick manner from seasonal associate to manager in a matter of 4 to 6 months
good,"This place for the most part is a good place to work at. There are definitely some negatives as well as positives to the job. Some of the positives that come out of the job is you work with great co-workers and if you meet sales numbers you get an opportunity to bonus, so a very nice incentive for pushing yourself to meet daily goals. Another great bonus is the fact that you get a really great discount on many items in store, which I feel makes up for a lot of the negatives. Some of the negatives from the job is that they tell you as a sales associate to hit a certain revenue per hour yet they constantly remind you that numbers aren't an issue. Kind of dumb to contradict yourself as a manager with stuff like that because they tell you not to stress about it but if it is slow or they are behind the goals for the day they constantly harass you to pretty much connect with customers to the point where they become annoyed with you. Management also has favorites so they try to compare you with those who have seniority over you and if you aren't working like they are, then you aren't a good worker in their eyes. There's good days as well as bad days,but overall if you are looking for a temporary job in retail to finish school or other objectives and get some money on the side this is a good place to work."
good,"This job was fun for a while, but they start picking at every little thing you do and it begins to be no fun. Management is friendly but really have no clue how to manage the store. Very micomanaged."
good,"It was fun learning about the different items sold in the store, but you receive very little hours if part time."
good,"A day at work consisted of helping customers with various questions about new technology. Keeping a clean work place. I learned many important leadership qualities. Not just being a boss but being a true leader. My management team was very informative and ready to teach. My co-workers were very energetic and positive. Always eager to learn more. The hardest part of the job would be the customers at times. Unfortunately, one of the other things I learned is that you cannot please everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different interactions with people, and helping solve issues that they may be having."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy can easily be one of your best jobs in your employment history. The company seems to push you in a friendly, nurturing way, while expecting the basic retail-focused results. The co-workers and management are usually quite jovial. I learned quickly to enjoy the workday while at the same time getting to as many work projects as possible."
good,I had an amazing time working for Best Buy. i enjoyed every moment of my employment with them.
good,Get to meet several people and learn new things on a daily basis
good,assisting customers i liked the coworkers i liked working with movies and music there was nothing hard cause i was like a greeter
good,The work atmosphere was great its just that they didn't have enough hours to go around for individuals that wanted full time status this is mainly due to the number of employees working in the store at any given time.
good,"They over hired staff which dropped the hours of part tome employees, it’s hard to live off of 13 hours a week when you are open for more than 40 hours in a week"
good,I only worked there for the holidays but for the time being it was never boring. Although they do have metrics about having to get people to buy warranties on their things which Is a little ridiculous because there is no was of knowing that 60% of your customers are going to buy it. They were pretty flexible about when you could go on lunch and take your breaks. another down side was that the training was awful. No one would show you how to do the job they would just do it for you which leaves you helpless when you're in the situation next time.
good,"Your experience at Best Buy is definitely dependent on your coworkers.  I was lucky enough to work at two different Best Buy's with amazing leadership.  Both stores created an inclusive, fun environment that made living the retail life a little more bearable."
good,Work experience can be both excellent and life changing or horrendous depending on your personality and which position you work.Choosing the right role is very important but just getting your foot in somewhere might not be a bad idea. Always look to move around if you're not satisfied and management will usually work with you.
good,"I clock in and count the money, balance, put the drawers out, create a deposit, then balance in our system while I help out customer service if need be. Also respond to any manager calls or overrides. Usually only two managers would open so we would get them as we are available. I learned to have a lot of patience because customers can be very difficult at times. Hardest part is solving issues that were out of my control, I have to escalate many situations to other teams within best buy to fix customer issues, the hardest part is calming the customer down. But usually every customer left feeling better after speaking with me, I care for every situation and they could tell. Part I most enjoy is helping my co-workers and helping fix issues or resolve customer issues. I teach them faster ways or just help them utilize all the tools we have to make their job a lot easier. We work as a team, they know I'm there to help them no matter what the situation is."
good,"Fun environment"
good,"Great team atmosphere."
good,I am not big fan of retail store jobs .. However Best Buy is incredible job to work for. They got a lot of potential and still growing.The work environment was great.. It was rewarding helping customers on the sales floor I learned how to better myself their and learned new things about the company itself.Management was great they taught me well and how to make it in the business.
good,"Very customer based company"
good,"smooth work environment"
good,"Best Buy is a great place to work.  It has very nice and enjoyable employees that work well together. I really enjoyed helping the customers get the products they were looking for.  Although, I felt that the employees weren't appreciated for all of the time and work that they put into the company.  Management was more worried about meeting numbers than making sure the employees were happy."
good,"Best Buy is a very relaxed store to work at, but when it's busy its very quick paced and competitive. There is always something to do and always something to sell."
good,"Es un buen empleo con gran salario, el problema es que no hay crecimiento."
good,"sales, coaching, cashier. customer service, training associates, opening closing duties. friendly staff management and customers. great place to work."
good,"Loved the culture, the people, and the benefits.Amazing Discount and great benefits like PTO Sick and Vacation time that you will not find everywhere."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I love working a round peoples with a positive attitude and a team player. I love my job and being able to my peoples happy at the end of the day. Working in high rise buildings and helping residents out is everything to me.
good,"It was alright job, but the management staff didn’t have things in order as far as when did workers take breaks ! Half the time we would never get a break after working for 6 or 7 hours without stoping for the day"
good,"Best Buy was a great learning experience, I learned how to problem solve  while thinking outside of the box. I learned how to meet qoutas and met some cool people along the way."
good,I would say try and work during the holidays cause it very busy and it’s a lot of fun. Helping people was the best part of my day. The only bad thing at Best Buy was it’s management they really didn’t seem to care about there employee form time and there was a lot of favoritism.
good,"Typical day at work of selling electronics especially selling phones and other cellular items. I have learned a lot about the functions of different electronic devices. There really wasn't a hard part about my job, I actually had fun with this job and with my coworkers"
good,Best Buy was a good place to work at with great people and amazing opportunity’s I would tell people great things about Best Buy because that is the best place
good,"I absolutely love working at Best Buy My co worker are great and the managers are awesome, very loving and supportive team that loves to get work done! 👏🏾"
good,"fun workplace, provided customer service, great people to work with and work for, fun work environment, learned how to sale customers and services, as well as other areas of the business"
good,it was a great work experience as far as co-workers but some of the elders like managers and supervisors over worked the vulnerable employees
good,This place is a non friendly work environment and there works can do or say what they want and no actions take place when you take issues up with management
good,"- Hire UNPROFESSIONAL people; its a numbers game "
good,"J'ai aimer le travail en équipe et les concours qui ce fesait."
good,"I usually check for price changes on items such as movies, music, software and games. Every Tuesdays, we set up for new movies and new music. Wednesdays we pull items and return to warehouse. Thursdays and Fridays, we organize and make sure all items are full on the floor before the store was opened. my co workers were nice. it's hard not to have full time job since it was retail store. i enjoy looking at new movies and set them up."
good,"Upper management should have more training, otherwise great team!"
good,"Co-workers were a pleasure to work with, managers not so much. Little to no flexibility with regards to schedule. No raises nor benefits. Measly discount. Bi-monthly paychecks also severely aggravating."
good,Great if you are in school and trying to work as well. Teacher you a lot communication skills and you learn a lot more with electronics. The training I received was great! The pay is decent.
good,"I worked for this company for 6+ years. After multiple attempts for Supervisor positions, I was fired because a customer flat out lied about our interaction."
good,Working at best buy gave me a solid foundation and lots of skills to bring with me to other jobs. I am very proud to say I have worked for best buy. Also they really care about their employees.
good,"The workflow was great, but the late hours and schedule changes at the last minute really concerned me. I really liked working there."
good,"A Typical Day at Best Buy: Start of the day:Unloading the truck and pulling pallets too the floor while running back and forth doing carryouts,Middle of the day:mostly working in the back breaking down backstock or working on the floor covering in a department.End Of The Night or Day:Getting all the pallets emptied and wrapped up"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"It's a good job, not horrible, but they lure you with false promises of advancement but always end up hiring the mediocre employees as supervisors then they wonder why they keep failing."
good,While the atmosphere of Best Buy is great some of the behind the scenes aspects are not so awesome. The work is easy and if you know how to talk to customer then great however if you want to learn beyond that or grow in the company good luck.
good,Location I worked for was unprofessional and didn’t offer career advancement. Maybe if it was a different location and I was able to relocate at the time it would have been different.
good,Great place to work and learn about technology and sales perfect for full-time students looking for a part-time job competitive pay decent compensation internal benefits looks good on your resume would recommend Best Buy to anyone looking for electronic sales career and experience
good,"good part time job and overall good workplace environment. management was fair and great incentives. Typical day at work for me included greeting customers, helping customers out with their needs, processing returns and buy."
good,I do not have a review to write for this company. Each person should base their decision on their own needs. I have no comments to add in this block for this company
good,"A Day at best buy is never boring, with a wide range of products that are always changing. You have to always be learning the products while teaching what you learned to the customer. The mid grade management is very helpful and knowledgeable.  Some times you have to hand customers over to other coworkers that have more in-depth knowledge of a particular product.  I have to say the hardest part of the job is writing the customers wants and needs in a product their interested in while give them my full attention.  The thing I love most about the job is that I get to help customers get something that they will use and love for the length of the products life."
good,"Best Buy has its pros and cons. A typical day at work consists of touching base with a supervisor or manager and talk about goals for the day, what you can do to sell better, and what needs improvement. It depends on the associate's attitude that really determines the sale and relationship between customer and worker. Hardest part of the job is being able to do what the customer wants. We have restrictions and sometimes it does become frustrating."
good,"I loved this company when I first started but when management changed, the job became very stressful. Our manager was very negative and drove down the morale of every employee there. I left because my wife and I had our first child and it was just the right time."
good,I was promised upward mobility when I was hired.. I told them I wanted a career not just a part time job. There is no bonus structure and no chance of moving up now.
good,"I enjoyed the store and environment at first until management changed 3 times in under a year. No managers could be found and they all lacked communication amongst themselves; each individual had their own personal agenda. I enjoyed working with the customers and co-workers, training new employees, and taking on new tasks that expanded past my particular department."
good,"I have been with Best Buy for almost 2 years and even though I enjoy everyone that I work with, I am no longer excited about my position. I am looking for a career change."
good,The pay was minimum wage and benefits not that great. Management at the store I was working at was not very good at communicating with each other either.
good,"Bien"
good,they worked everybody fairly but you could always tell who was the favorite due to how often they could get away without discipline for mistakes or them not getting points for missing work.
good,I loved the people and my direct supervisor. My manager was the worst. Very unfair. Did not care about his people. Very flexible hours. Work with days off. I love this job.
good,"8 hours of waiting for customers, management not coaching to full potential and every manager is focused on something different, it's hard to satisfy management when everyone tells you something different."
good,"Working there during the holidays can be HECTIC! but it was pretty cool. I worked in the warehouse part, so I didn't deal with customers head on in a specific department. Majority of my shift, the store was closed anyway, which made it so much easier to do my job. "
good,"Since the new CEO Corrie took over, there have been job cuts and some people have worried about losing jobs. Bonuses are smaller than they once were, job positions in management are being consolidated and those remaining are working much harder for the same or less pay than before."
good,"always something to do to keep you busy. great management team when i first got on then people moved around to other stores and lost the good things about them,"
good,it was frustrating when you are one of the only people who does side work when we werent busy and never being recognised for it. also i asked for a yearly review several times and that never happened so i never got the chance for a raise
good,Love my job and what I do but my team members and department were treated like second rate citizens by management and the sales floor. My department being warehouse.
good,"I love my job at Best Buy and the people that I work along side with are the number one reason (besides pay) that I love this job so much. With that being said like every place there are few in management that are seemingly nice on the outside but pick favorites and outcast those they don't favor. Pushing their team so far if they don't make sales or percentages that they make their employees seem easily replaceable. I don't approve of this behavior and I don't condone the two sided nature of one particular manager in mind. Though I will say that management as a whole can be extremely pushy about meeting goals, going so far as to cut your hours to the bare minimum just to make you want to quit and when you confront them about it, you better expect some kind of BS explanation because that's what they're going to give you! Best Buy as a COMPANY is amazing! They genuinely care about their employees and if you go to ANY other store location, it's going to be a million times better than this one! The Culture is great! The people you work along side with are quirky and make your job fun whether or not you have extremely irate customers (Which happens a lot, especially if you're in customer service) So they make up for the sucky treatment we all experience from management and customers alike! Also Best Buy offers competitive pay so you can always count that you'll be paid enough, but unless you're full time, I wouldn't count on the hours! (Number 2 reason people are constantly leaving! Second to the Number 1 reason, which is management) If you're reading this and you're not from around"
good,"The job requires interacting with customers about the latest in technology, and helping them find a product that best fits their needs. In the spare time, you use the time to clean and down stock, making sure your section is tidy and products are on the shelves fro customers."
good,Overall if you're looking for some temporary its okay. There isn't a lot of room for advancement within the company. You can move sideways but not up.
good,The staff are wonderful and it is a fun and competitive atmosphere to be there.  It promotes healthy competition.  High sales focus and aggressive atmosphere.
good,"Great environment to work in but fellow employees made it hard to work. Due to unnecessary drama, gossip and not enough team comradery. Also management was very shaky"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Best Buy I was a seasonal worker although, I was my position ended early without any notice. Overall I had a great experience working there they really work with you if you are in school or have other obligations."
good,"Being considered the ""backbone"" of the store, the warehouse department was held up to the highest of standards and watched over consistently through the managers. However, we did not receive any of the benefits that floor salesmen would get free drinks, candy, and movies through opening best buy apps. However, the discounts the company gives its employees is really great for a gamer and any philanthropist in technology."
good,"I enjoyed working here, It really opened my knowledge base for technology and helped me advance my time management because of the fast paced work environment that they have"
good,Not a very good place for advancement. If it is just a stepping stone for college students perfect. A lot of favoritism inside the company. It started great but the company lost their way.
good,Store management was good but upper management (district managers) were horrible. They'd rather hire outside than someone who's been in role for 3 years
good,"Walk around and help whatever customer you see. It doesn't matter which department you have to help them. That's why they train you top run every department. Some individuals get overtime and long lunch, others don't. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face when you know people their are racist and its been documented that it's true. The other hard part is walking around the store your entire shift."
good,"In a small store you are asked to do your work; stocking, dusting, helping customers; not only in your area but in every area. You will be pulled in a minimum of 3 different directions every day. But are talked down on when not connecting with the customer. Do not forget about Branded Payments. You have to make people run their credit for a card they may not want because each week you MUST have at least 2 people do this. I am not the type of person to force someone to do something they do not want to do. But as a best buy employee you are punished for not meeting this quota."
good,"..  They are restructuring....which means the management is getting rid of staff they Don't like. As for raises the most you""'ll see if you are lucky is 20 cent yearly. You are basicly working with all kids , that think they know everything . Good luck"
good,"A typical day at work would be the same routine, you would walk in and get ready to start the day. Sometimes it can be really crazy or really slow, However, if your team has the right attitude, you can accomplish a lot during the day. The hardest part about the job can be the customers but they can be the most rewarding part as well."
good,My postion at best buy was great but I will not ever work for that company again. I was terminated while i was on maternity leave.
good,"Co-workers are good, but management just worries about looking good with numbers. If they are not making it they will cut your hours."
good,"Great work environment depending on the location. However, the management and company loyalty is lacking. Your experience all depends on the people around you."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy was once very loyal to employees and granted many opportunities to move higher and build careers. As of now job security is a main distraction in all employees minds.
good,"I enjoyed working installing car audio, I had learned a great deal about electronics and they provided the training for me to get my MECP certification.  Each day was different as far as the vehicles you work on as well as the items being installed.  Management seems condescending and did not know much about what we installed or how.  The co-workers were great and very friendly.  The downside about this job is you have to be available on the weekends and 3 week days even as a part-time employee but that did not necessarily mean you would get that many hours.  I really enjoyed the work environment and the new products brought in."
good,No work life balance within this company. Zero room for advancement
good,"I loved my co-workers. Very hardworking job, hours are crazy."
good,"I wouldnt make a career out of best buy, but it was fun while in college! Great employee benefits a few years ago, but they are getting rid of all the discounts that were worth it"
good,When i started working at best buy there was plenty of room for advancement but now that they have cut alot of stores into community stores there is just not enough management postions to advance unless you were to move away to a store that is a big box then there are a few more.
good,"Working as a loss prevention specialist I was able to make sure the security of the store was kept up. I monitored the surveillance cameras to make sure that customers in the store were not stealing merchandise. I also greeted customers as the came in the store, and check out large purchases."
good,"The job is not hard at all, depending on your mindset. It can get repetitive. Like most other jobs you get higher in position by being a favorite. Pushing for credit cards can get annoying."
good,Working at Best Buy was Quite the experience interacting with customers on is it ups and downs dealing with a difficult customers on an every day basis.
good,"I spent 10 years at Best Buy/Geek Squad.  It was a great company to work for especially when it comes to gaining experience.  Everything from sales, and customer service to tech support and problem solving."
good,Nothing extra worth noting from working here. I did graveyard shift and morning shift stocking. The position might be managed differently now as they were making changes to the department as I was leaving.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work, as the the actual workloads were never too demanding, however, it was the people that I had to work under that I had issues with."
good,"Learned a lot about technology and sales experience, not great hours, but ive met some good people, its hard to get a full time position here. But its good benefits wise and they care about your mental health."
good,My seasonal position at this location was decent. The tasks for my position was easy and sometimes fun but overall the workplace environment felt a bit crowded and the lethargic.
good,"The company is great if you are fresh out of high school and are looking for something to put a little cash in your pocket. Outside of that, the company sets unrealistic hourly goals for each employee to make, forces employees to push credit cards on customers. "
good,The people you work with are about creating a culture where you want to come to work in a fun environment. The managers play favorites and were spiteful or grudgeful
good,"Small competitions with coworkers were fun and promoted work goals. Weekly reviews with supervisors helped improve job performance. However, without many locations in your area or an ability to move, job advancement is extremely limited. Also, a manager told me that he found it “disturbing” that I applied for a promotion due to more stability in hours and being better in line with childcare needs; a normal answer is money or advancement. When I included this in my resignation, I was informed that it wasn’t an issue and that Best Buy adequately works with families. Full time positions require weeekend and evening shifts, which ar not doable with regular daycare hours for new parents."
good,"No flexibility with work hours. As a part timer i was given 40+ hours, even though i requested a lower amount of hours."
good,"Great place to work and the environment was always cheerful, Management refused to allow for any advancement in the company and only promoted those that were their friends"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,I remember being scheduled to come in at 11 on thanksgiving which effectively was like working on a holiday while only receiving 1 hour of holiday pay
good,Company as a whole needs to hire more people to help with customers. From my personal experience they had trusted employees doing three jobs instead of one. Proper hiring process and training would fix this small problem.
good,I worked with the company for almost 5 years and i absolutely loved it. I had such a strong team and it really felt like a family. They were flexible with my schedule so i was able to work full time while attending school full time to obtain my BA
good,Always have to hit monthly numbers if not you go on a action plan if that action plan doesnt work then you will be let go from the company. This is for appliance sales only
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work at from the products to the hours I was getting, even if I was bored getting paid doing it wasn’t bad. Although my manager wasn’t the best I enjoyed my experience at best Buy."
good,"A day working at the Geek Squad was to check in orders, price services orders depending on the issue. Break fix viruses back up external hardware and if needed over charge the customers with warranties."
good,"If you are looking for a short term retail career best Buy is one of the best.  If you are looking for a long term job with advancement then you may want to look at other retailers.  At times it feels like personal connections and who you know takes preference to job performance, skills and experience."
good,"The people you work with are great, management is lacking if there is any. Very unorganized. Structure and advancement in store is hard to come by. Best bet is to go to inhome agent."
good,"After installing a TV in a home that reeked of urine, and then the customer proceeded to demo his new TV with inappropriate videos, we were told that that was just ""part of the job."" The management rules by stringing good people along with empty promises."
good,BestBuy showed me that nothing in the work environment is black and white. Everyday is going to be different and you have to sink or swim. they showed me how to swim.
good,working on the sales floor is bitter sweet.engaging with customers is always great but the overall work environment can be frustrating . everyone is focused on revenue rather then  getting what the client actually needs
good,This is a job for people who LOVE retail. The environment is fun and the people are easy to get along with. Expect to work weekends and EVERY holiday except for Christmas Day.
good,"Not a bad place to work. The people are nice. It's kind of a loud environment, but you can wear ear buds and listen to music. It can be difficult to sit all day."
good,"the job was okay but didn't really care about us the associates. when we needed to make sales we made them, but if we wanted to get a second just best buy wouldn't honor that."
good,Depending on the flow of traffic you could be either standing around all day cleaning and doing maintenance on display products or so busy you forget to go to lunch and get written up. What I learned from working at Best Buy was that its okay to be yelled at on a daily basis by customers for something you didn't do. Also that its all about hitting budgets and getting those bonuses for the month as well as getting credit card apps so the store does not get charged for not meeting its quota. Management was run by very nice people but you never really get to know who they actually are beside all the small meaningless talks about apps and revenue. If you did get to know them it was only if you liked exactly what they like to do in their spare time. The employees vary you can either hate them with a passion and dread working with them when you see their name on the schedule or you can be so excited your best work friend is going to be there. The hardest part of this job is losing work friends from the constant turn over as well as having a terrible supervisor who treats you with disrespect because of your gender. But the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the people who come into the store and make your day by bringing a smile to your face when all you did was help them find a cable.That may sound weird but maybe the cable was needed so they can download pictures of there lost son or maybe the cable was needed to set up a TV for some family bonding time. The best part is making friends with your co-worlkers and continue that friendship outside of work. Overall if you need
good,Fun business very fast paste flexible with hours learned alot from working with this company and good team to work with company values employees
good,Did home theater consults and did in store sales. Work on and off for many years met great people all over. great starting point to build a career.
good,"Sales based. "
good,The people were really nice and nice to work with. It was fun to work black Friday and cyber Monday. Best Buy ethics revolved around trust. The trust that a CSR can have with the customer.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Ok job if you plan to make a lot of purchases in the store.  If you're a cashier, work may get repetitive and if the store is not busy, you may not get a lot of customer interaction."
good,"I've learned alot about servicing customers in the world of retail, the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is that I get to help people find products that can ultimately make their life a little bit easier.The management is okay, while some co-workers are reliable when others aren't. Hardest part of the job is the demand of sales from management like we're on commission."
good,Great job for college and high school kids. Bonus if store hits budget per quarter.
good,"The Retail sector keeps changing, and Best Buy is thrust in this reality. With many competitors such as Amazon, Best Buy has an uphill climb everyday.  Market share is so vital, and hard to come by, Best Buy is tasked to keep up. Do they?"
good,Great company but due to the economy they are laying off people every week since the new CEO came into the picture.
good,"•	Sales of computers, tablets, services and accessories"
good,Good place to work just not for a career not enough money or room to grow
good,"I worked at Best Buy Mobile for almost five years. Best buy as a company is great. I would recommend it to any of my peers and family. Difficult part of my job is the lack of support and leadership we get from the management level. There is no distinction between coworkers to peers, which leads to many internal issues. The best part of my job was the discounts we received as employees. One on one interactions between customers."
good,Sometimes the hours were too long during the holidays. Little time between closing and opening to rest. Management did not compuncate well. Too many chefs not enough indains. Needs more organization. But overall I enjoyed the customers and the empoyees.
good,"Light route, good support, and tools to do the job right. Geek squad was a great place to work. Management was horrible they wold always promote retail workers to service."
good,"A typical day at work depends on what shift you're on. For morning shift, the price gun couldn't read through the plastic covers on the game cases, so each one had to be typed by hand. Every few minutes a supervisor or other employee aspiring to be supervisor would come over and ask why it is not done yet. Showing them the bar codes can't be scanned and must be typed in only opened one up to attacks on work ethic, home life, and anything else the addressing employee can think of. Coming in for the mid or last shift is quite a bit better, as everyone is more relaxed and willing to focus on work."
good,opening the department was rather simple we turned every piece of merchandise on. the we casually talked to every customer to find thier individual needs then found the proper solution for them.
good,"Best Buy was at one point a job I enjoyed going to. In recent times, it has become a horrible place to work. They no longer care about the workers who dedicate their time to best buy, they rather bark orders at you as if you are a slave. Best Buy was an awesome place to work, management was reasonable, understanding. The co-workers are quite friendly, however its gotten driven into the ground."
good,A normal day at Best Buy is much like any other big box retail store. What I typically do is assist customers finding what they came into the store looking for. You are required to have a certain level of product knowledge in the department that you work in.
good,"If you like home entertainment working here give you the opportunity to talk about anything related to gaming, computers, home theatre, or mobile phones."
good,"Very supportive team, good way to jumpstart anyone's career. Good work environment. Fast-paced in a non-stressful way environment. Decent salary as well."
good,"This position was a great position to grow my customer service and technical skills since I was working in the Geek Squad as well as helping in the computing department. Most of the employees were very friendly and shifts were pretty enjoyable. "
good,"The only real issue i had at the job was it was seasonal.... I was looking to be a full time job but that did not happen it was fun while it lasted, I feel like the managers didn't do anything to keep there employees who wanted to stay, I felt like I went through alot of that training for nothing. I also notice that even if you were working for the company once you are laid off it seems harder to get another position in the company I would have expected them to hire within but that is not entirely true. If you get in its a cool place to work I know a few people still working there till this day."
good,"Assisting customers with finding the right product for their needs,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Learned many things while supported by leaders, but change is constant and projects are rolled into production without testing and stabilizing the environments."
good,With the compa y consistently cutting and Changing manager and leadership roles every 3-4 yrs job security is a big concern as well as work life balance.
good,"It's your basic retail life within a corporate company. Rigid compensation guidelines, focuses on guest service often at the expense of the worker. Generous discount."
good,This company has provided a fun and work-friendly environment focused on growth and development. Sales goals can be tough to reach sometimes but if you push yourself then that problem can be easily solved.
good,"At first it was great but, their is no room to grow if you wanna become a lead or, a manger good luck. The benefits are great like heath care, your discounts not so great."
good,"Typical day at work at Best Buy was busy up until closing when it closed, then it got slower.  Work consisted of helping customers checking out product"
good,it was okay just looking for something closer to my house with better pay and more hours. working there did not help me with my financial situation which is why I am exploring other options
good,Company requires lots of time away from family and most of the time aren’t reasonable! High expectations and no compensation! Loved my co workers and most of management! Wish it would have been different.
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work. The work could be stressful and management could be better but I worked with good people and am thankful for the opportunity."
good,I feel deeply saddened by the way my career ended. I suffered a stroke and was asked to step down instead of being offered opportunities for assistance. I was not supported as a female supervisor by the general manager. In fact the person who took over with similar credentials was offered 2$ more per hour when I had been told I was at cap. The GM tended to support male leaders better than female.
good,"It was a job "
good,Recommend it if you are really interested in tech however be aware of high stress situations and if you are not comfortable with that I wouldn't apply
good,"You give Years to the company with little pay raise. Wasted experience as a manager, due to no job movement at the bottom. Overall a decent part time gig. But you will feel pressured to meet goals."
good,"Stressful, but pays decently. Culture is okay but can be considered a boys club. Targets can be high and management isn't always inclined to help you meet them"
good,Best Buy was a pretty fun place to work at. Team achievements were celebrated. Opportunity for advancement was political. Great holiday parties. Good training for success. Decent discounts.
good,"Everyday work is not bad and I've met great people through my store, but seeking advancement and a career is difficult as management positions rarely become available."
good,"Its alright. Its alright. Didnt work there fpor too ;long but I remember the culture being great and the staff being mostly students and generally fun.  Grat work culture. "
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Dont expect to move anywhere up in this company because it doesnt happen. Poor managers and hours are a little odd in the warehouse. Its an okay job for college/highschool students. regarding warehouse*
good,"Mais, je ne trouve pas que c'est un bon travail comme carrière."
good,"The benefits are great and that is about it. Unless you want to continue a career in retail, do not waste your time here after school. There is not a lot of growth, and even if there is, there is minimal wage increase but a maximal duties increase."
good,Don't get me wrong It was fun to work for best buy. I just didn't see the need for all of the toys. When I worked at best buy back in the day people still purchased software and compact disks. I liked the fun atmosphere. I just didn't enjoy the long holiday hours. Example Closing at 11:00 pm and turning around and going back in at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning.
good,Who knows what levels of corporate are watching these websites to see whats being posted. Retaliation has been a problem for me in the past so I don't feel comfortable with reviewing the company I currently work for.
good,"It was a job... Chances for advancement were slim to none unless the management liked you. Pay was OK. They compensated for mediocre pay with an even more mediocre employee discount. All in all, I enjoyed working with the people over everything else! Best Buy hires some of the most genuine people and then sucks them dry! the only real way to be successful within the company is to make it into management."
good,"Depending on what your job title is within this company, is how awesome you think it is.  Its not a terrible place to work, it's just how little they pay their really knowledgeable employees that's the problem!"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I worked warehouse and media (Movies/CD's). The job was very fun and relaxed environment. The hours were decent and you could always pick up a shift because someone always wanted a certain day off. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing new product and getting to test things out. The Hardest part was working truck and being stuck longer then you expected to be stuck at work for. "
good,"They don't care what family life you have they will schedule you all nights even if you're a single parent with limited daycare options. Some managers are cool, but they will target you to fire you."
good,"Essentially the title, if you can get in with a good leadership team, you'll love every minute you work there. When the management team begins to cycle out and change, be wary of who replaces who"
good,Fun place to work but not really any room for improvement.  It is a great place to start building a resume and prepares you well for moving on to bigger and better things.
good,"Very fun place to work, but the pay is really low.  There is no such thing as competitive pay.  Overall, for a learning to deal with new problems for SOHO and/or PC's, including basic network related-issues, it's a very good place to grow."
good,"nothing more to be said as an entire team was let go, but the form leaders were kept on staff, does not show strength as these leaders were question about their decisions approx. 1 year prior to being laid off for their business decision."
good,"Promised advancement and put in the effort, made temporary supervisor multiple times, received employee of the month multiple times, but was always returned to team member status after holidays.  Lack of respect, though expected to give best effort.  5 years of hard work and training, but still nothing but a team member."
good,"Had tons of fun at the job but management never understood what we did in geek squad and made life hard because of this.When you did get lucky and have a good manager, the job was fun and challenging. When you did not have a good manager, the job because a battle that was often lost by the lower level employees."
good,"while the company is nice, it expects too much out of their workers. they are supposed to drive credit cards and something labeled as total tech support which is 200 a year with only some benefits that could help certain people. Management is constantly on you about these things. other than this, the workers are actually quite polite and fun to be around and it has been a good experience cause of them."
good,"Front End Agents, in the eyes of the public were supposed to fix everything free of charge.  Customers were upset that I wasn't able to fix a fried hard drive on the spot."
good,The management is very numbers driven and that gets in the way of helping the customer. The work is good for an installation agent you set your own pace and get done when you want.
good,"In the inventory department the daily tasks are very consistent and are very repetitive. Every day included daily shipping and receiving, online orders to be fulfilled, appliance carry-outs , and daily paperwork to be verified and approved."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"If you are in college or high school, best buy is a wonderful place to work. But it is not a career company unless you are lucky enough to be promoted early and quickly."
good,Great company to work for as long as you have the right manager. As long as management is knowledgeable and recognizes hard work and effort. Some managers have been better than others.
good,"It's an average retail job, advancement is limited and hours like all retail are unpredictable. Discounts are good but a lot of specialized knowledge is necessary for average compensation."
good,I had a lot of fun working there but it was pushing credit cards and they are always running out of hours. They're mostly seasonal ( christmas) and they have over time during winter. T hey required I worked on thanksgiving until 3am to black friday. But defiantly a dying company.
good,Although best buy is a fun and relaxed worked place the management only cares about themselves... Part time workers are worked as full time with no benefits  offered. The Geek Squad area which i am in isn't paid enough for the work load we are given and expected to complete everyday.
good,to be honest its actually a great place to work and the values the company says they want to project seems legit and they do seem to care but all and all the people i worked with ended up spoiling it for me for how i felt about working there.
good,"You make alot of good friends working here, however most positions here will never consider you for anything but. The constant stress of trying to make sales every couple of minutes, as well as often being shown how your revenue is doing compared to your coworkers, is sometimes too much. If you aren't acting like a car salesman, its tough to stay at this job. Definitely not a flexible job, and those with school or another job are highly encouraged to seek elsewhere."
good,Good for a starting job.  Not so sure I can recommend long-term though.  Needs more advancement opportunities.  I think technical skill should be placed higher on their skill-weight scale.
good,The job was great except they only had part time positions available in my area. The customer interaction was amazing and the management was always there to help.
good,It's a really fun workplace where you can learn a lot of things. The only thing that really makes it worse is the management. They will take you for granted and not pay you what you deserve.
good,"good for my first job"
good,Spend most of the time as a leader trying to figure our how to implement the new procedures that the company is implementing with out the labor hours to complete such task.
good,Best Buy is an awesome place to work and shop but needs to work on their management and treating their employees better. if fixing a few problems and updating some of their technology would make employees lives much easier. Really need to fix the schedule especially during holiday season.
good,"Working customer service was neither amazing, nor terrible. Work place culture is influenced by the store managers and luckily I had a dedicated one. Overall you need to be patient with customers, just like any other customer service job."
good,Not a bad job if you are looking for a simple retail job. Corporate jobs seemed good. Poor implementation of corporate values in retail setting. Hours are decent.
good,Benefits almost balance out the below average wages for similar work(and lack of commission) but that many people spend six or seven years in an entry level position is offset painfully by the tendency to try and get rid of people who can be easily replaced by cheaper New hires in their same role
good,"Good place to work, unfortunately no real room for advancement in this area. Fun atmosphere, good people. Discount is worth the job itself. If looking to advance in the company need to move to an area where there are multiple bestbuys locally"
good,"When I first started working for the company, management was great, and everyone worked well together. As the years went on, and different managers came, the store quickly went downhill."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,a good amount of the managers have a powertrip. they don't stay within their department and almost always will try to overstep their boundaries to force their method of doing things onto another departments team.
good,"just wanted the day to fly by. learned the scanner, some computer work, receiving and forklift operation. workplace culture was good. hardest part of the job was pleasing the supervisors and management and working in an oven and stacking heavy objects most of the time. the best part was seeing my buddies everyday and getting each other through the day."
good,"This was not a bad job, but then you add the costumers, many of the them feel entitled and that they are owed something for just walking through the doors. Other then having to deal with those type of people I loved working at Best Buy. The pay and lack of benefits sucked but I liked who I worked with."
good,Was a great learning experience on how to sell things to others and how to deal with people even if they are complacent or rude. I worked on the sales floor and the warehouse the only problem was we had a total of 20 employees and 13 of them where managers of some sort each of them contradicting each other sometimes or go over each others heads other then at it was a fun and enjoyable working experience
good,"If you truly love technology and selling it to customers then this is the place for you. You have the opportunity to drive your career but don't wait for someone to recognize it. Work hard, inspire your peers and take on all the responsibilities and you will earn promotions."
good,"The people you work with on an every day basis are typically pretty cool and fun, but the leadership within the store is mind boggling stressful to deal with. I've worked in many stores in many states, so it's a company wide problem."
good,great helpful coworkers helpful at times it can be overwhelming with customers demands but we get those good customers that make it easier to past the day
good,easy to get sucked into the atmosphere which is not usually a bad thing. depends on store leadership but overall was a fun and engaging place to work.
good,"Busy at peak times, to many hours around Christmas but after that the hours go way down. If you are looking for a part time job with occasional overtime this is a perfect fit for you. Management is good to deal with."
good,"I'm not going to trash the company with my review because i dont like that i Will give my experiences with the company though."
good,i loved working here byt got laid off due to budgjet changes other wise the staff and management where friendly and fun to be with and the work atmosphere was fast paced but non stressful
good,It is a fast working  easy going friendly environment  The only bad thing about it  are the hours and no job security there mostly temporarily jobs...
good,I was working at best buy for about 4 years and I really don't think I was treated fairly or compensated fairly. The management was disorganized and got annoyed when you asked for help. You had to know who to talk to. When you would ask for keys to get something they would take their sweet time and the customers would get angry because the managers would not be doing their jobs. I was working there longer than most of the employees in my department and they were getting the opportunities that I deserved for working harder and I had more experience  than them. I applied for a fulltime position a couple times and they gave the position to someone else because they said the other employee had more experience  and they were working for the company for 2 years less than I was I didn't think that was fair. I also didn't think it was fair that I basically had to beg for a raise. New hired employees were getting paid more than I was and I had been there 3 years prior to that. But I do have some positive things to say about this company as well I met a lot of people that I connected with there and I learned a lot from working there. I learned how to perform great customer service on my own.
good,"The culture at BBY is something often spoken of, but rarely implemented or lived. There's a very high turnaround with management and lower."
good,Basic sales job with difficulties in acquiring product due to the larger retail store. Servicing the business customer has proven to be difficult  when Best Buy looks at them as a secondary market and not a valued priority.
good,Typical day is setting up to sell and selling. Management has gotten better in recent time. Hardest part of the job is the uncontrollable parts.
good,Not a bad job to learn about technology just have a lack of consistency with full time employee in regards to hours. enjoy just need growth in career.
good,"Best Buy is a ok job if u need a job while in school. The job is hard to move up in and very hard to get benefits. you would think this job would be enjoyable after working here for 4 years, but its not and that's why I looking for something with advancement"
good,Trainers lack professionalism insults and bad mouthing of trainee makes for unpleasant work experience with company. Trainers have no compassion for learning style of trainee.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"as with most retailer manager come and go, there is a few who really care about employee and made it a fun place to work. It has away employee  could try and move around learn different jobs, but a large turnover for employee. Better job offer and more set hours"
good,"Best Buy was an easy job, it kind of helped me learn to deal with people more easily. The only downfall were the short work hours."
good,"Retail job, ringing out customers via cash register."
good,A hectic day with not enough help but a great time always with the latest technology. I wish the pay at this employer was equal to the amount of work
good,"At work I first check out all displays and make sure they are working, then prepare to interact wit my customers by checking stock. I have learned a lot about home entertainment and home automation systems and how fast technology changes. Management and co-workers are as diverse as can be with all kinds of different backgrounds. One of the downfalls I have learned working in two different markets of best buy however is that it is very much a political place with management and seems to be more beneficial on who you know not so much on how good you work.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the fast changing world of electronics and making sure it is the right solution for the customers needs. The best part of the job is always seeing the latest and greatest in electronics and being able to be hands on with them."
good,"Now that i am looking at over companies, Best Buy pays well but its a lot of your life you give them."
good,I worked at two locations. My first location i worked at made me love my job and the company. Management team was very well educated and knew the business. The management team at the second location I worked at didn't care about store morale or customer satisfaction. Best Buy as a company is great though.
good,"Over all its fun, but its retail at the end of the day."
good,"It was great to interact with employees"
good,"Dealt with a lot of customers who felt that the ""extra"" things, like XBOX one or PS4 were necessities in life. Some really great customers who understood that Best Buy is mostly a store of wants not needs."
good,"The line level employees run the sales floor.  The culture is great, very results drivenm"
good,"Best for customers, very few whinners, but a lot of older clients who needed help with computer basics. Sometimes we could assist over the phone considering the 15 min. AHT, most of the time we had to dispatch."
good,"I liked working here,people were good,but the there was no real security or advancement opportunities."
good,"Best Buy pays really well for the work that they expect you to do, but did not enjoy most days."
good,This company will spend their last dime to make sure employees are properly trained
good,"A typical day at work would consist of opening and receiving boxes, making sure all items match the manifest paperwork along with the shipping paperwork. Receiving items individually in to the system and repackaging them. Hardest part of the job was carrying the boxes because some boxes were extremely heavy. My specific manager was awesome and very friendly, the manager of the entire company was not friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my coworkers."
good,i have learned alot about technology working here. Its was a fast paced work place. Alot of customers to interact with on a day to day basis.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"typical day at work is some inventory , busy at front end , customers coming in and out , the hardest part of the job was the go backs because there were tons of them and there wasn't really enough space for them the store was a mess most of the time. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and helping them with products they were interested in"
good,"Great place to work, but there isn't much compensation. Good benefits and great coworkers. The company expects a lot over you for a slightly over minimum wage job."
good,"Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs. Offered special products and services to meet customers' special needs. Recommended merchandise based on customer needs. Maintained visually appealing and effective displays for the entire store. Educated customers on product and service offerings. Offered outstanding customer care to differentiate and promote the company brand. Balanced the needs of multiple customers, simultaneously, in a fast-paced retail environment. Operated a cash register to process cash, check and credit card transactions.  . Shared product knowledge with customers while making personal recommendations. Demonstrated that customers come first by serving them with a sense of urgency. Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions. Participated in various incentive programs and contests designed to support achievement of production goals."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,really chill place to work everyone is fun laid back and social but management needs to earn a little something called PEOPLE skills they'll dish what ever you let them so don't let them walk all over you  favorites are played so if you're just in it for a pay check go in do what you have to and get out in you're in it for a career make sure you get on a managers good side
good,"It was a great place to work part-time. If you are looking for average pay but a fun environment, look no further."
good,Loved working for the geek sqaud and enjoyed the people and the team 
good,"really retail kills family life, got to get back to Manufacturing and a 40 hour work week and get my family life back..."
good,"Driving and motivating employees, driving a positive customer experience and delivering profitable results for the stockholders"
good,Best Buy is a typical retail environment suitable during school.
good,Must keep up with ever advancing technology. Pay could be better.
good,"log on through cd, punch in , read emails, connect headset, answer inbound calls to place orders ..."
good,"Working with Best Buy could have have been a totally better experience if Management was upgraded. A typical day at work would be a day full of stress. Multiple, but impracticable, needed to be met but with barely any encouragement or recognition. You have your share of co-workers that are amazing and the one's who are there that don't really value working there but there to do what they're literally paid for. I worked in the computer section (PCHO) and I must say,climbing up and down ladders all day had to be the hardest part. You never know what you're going to have to lift up and pull down. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be meeting people everyday and getting along with other teammates.co-workers that work in the store; that's what really gets you through the day!"
good,Great atmosphere given seldom responsibilities but not much chance for advancement.
good,"Best Buy is a decent place to work, however most of the staff is under skilled in the knowledge of advanced computer information. The management is more fixated on finding faults in the employees than doing their jobs and making sure that the newest technology is available at a good cost and, that they're highest level of professionalism are incorporated in their daily work."
good,I loved working here i just didn't get the hours i was needing at the time. Great managers and co workers i knew my job and did it well.
good,Bottom line ... money. Morning meetings that were all about how to sell better. We were encouraged to sell a very powerful (more expensive) computer to customers when they really only needed a machine to do word processing and spread sheets.
good,Working at Best Buy was fun and rewarding. They tried to work and help you out as much as they could.
good,geek Squad gave me the opportunity to start my career in IT.
good,They will throw you in the deep end with bare minimum training. Often no clear instructions left to follow on ops procedures. Claim to be lgbtq friendly but not implemented in workplace. Management only cares about sales team.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best buy is a very fast pace environment, its an environment where you will see a different face everyday, its a job that requires heavy lifting at all times of the day,"
good,"good place to work just not during the holidays, can be very stressful and taxing if you don't moderate and plan out your days off, will use you as a full time employee even if you're part time"
good,"Best Buy, in my opinion is a life long career for only a select few.For most its where they learn important life skills to carry them through this crazy world"
good,this is a good company if you are entry level and want some customer service experience on your resume. I enjoyed working here and it was a great environment and love co workers.
good,Working at Best Buy thought me a lot about customer service and retail in general. I felt like I made a difference with every customer I worked with. My coworkers were friendly and knowledgeable. They supported me and everyone else in the store.
good,"If you're young & single, this is the job for you. If you have a family & things to be home for, not a good fit. No family time, hard to sleep, have to share rooms with difficult people."
good,"I really do enjoy working here at Best Buy, I just don't have a really good job/personal life balance due to the hours I work there. I want more time with my wife and kids then I do now. I don't want to wake up one day and wish I had more time with them."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, especially my specific store.  My coworkers are amazing, it's always evolving and there's always something new to learn.  Management is concerned about their quotas but it's not overwhelming and everybody gets to express themselves openly; However, if you're a full-time employee be prepared to give up at least one of your weekend days for the job.  Which I guess is common if you're working retail anyway."
good,"As with any retail job, they are designed for high turn over. The management is driven to have qualitative results based on sales or upselling. "
good,You learn and train on the job. It was always nice to see the latest tech out there. Discounted prices are amazing. Most of the team is very friendly.
good,"The job was a very fun fast paced place to work, the management needs improvement and sometimes they show their employees very little respect but it has been improving"
good,"You learn a lot about the products sold. It was a fun experience, but then it became a numbers game. Management became focused on numbers, some were even disrespectful. A ton of favoritism! Other than that, it was a fun environment."
good,"Best Buy is an ok store to shop at, but not to work. They claim to be all about the customer, but then want you to talk people into buying things they don't need or understand. They are very competitive and extremely number driving."
good,"I worked in the call center so it was pretty chill. We had quotas to meet daily, but it was ok if they weren't met, so long as they heard u asking for the sale."
good,"great work place compensation sucks, management varies by location as you move up in the ranks it gets better but expect to work there more than 4 years to achieve those goals."
good,"Good place to work a lot of friendly people, they train you in any place that you need help with. They do have a factor into favoritism which leads to many people getting promoted which should not be promoted."
good,I liked the job. The only issue was over worked not much balance because of Nights holidays and weekends work. It was rough during holidays that was very stressful.
good,"-I worked for Best Buy for a little under a year. "
good,"It was a fairly pleasant experience. They really harp on trying to generate credit card applications, getting protection plans, and attatching additional accessories to each sale. What brick and mortar retail store doesn't? If you are able to take everything the managers tell you with a grain of salt, put in some effort, your time there shouldn't be too bad."
good,Management praises you when you are destroying all of the expectations for the month and on a daily basis as well but if you are ever having a slow day where your metrics haven't been met yet they breathe down your throat and constantly demean you until you do. Job Security is almost non existent.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,When I started in 2013 it was great but the culture changed and I am no longer happy there with the new management it feels like they are more focus on sales then people
good,Good for advancement just have to put in your time. Don’t be discouraged of favoritism just focus on your reasoning for applying in the first place. This place is a good start but don’t plan a future with Best Buy .
good,"The requirements were a little hard to get used to but once properly explained you'll be good. The management was intimidating, which made it hard to want to bring concerns up to them. "
good,Good job easy to do but not much if any room for growth in house. It's also a challenge to maintain any realnfull time hours outside of Christmas season.
good,Good for a first job offers a lot of product knowledge and teaches you about retail and tech. Although there is not a lot of room for moving up within the company
good,"Not a bad place to work. I had issues with other departments at times as a merch associate, but overall very fast paced and productive. When everyone worked together, things would work way smoother."
good,"Hired as a seasonal employee for the winter and holiday months. "
good,Best buy was a good stepping stone to learn how to communicate face to face with customers.  This added me in future jobs when it was required to negotiate and relay information to individuals at other companies.
good,The management leaves something to be desired. The pay is ok. Its difficult to make ends meet. It is a place that thrives on brown noising. It's not bad for high school and college students. But it proves difficult for college graduates to live on their own.
good,"I was only there for a short time, but it seemed to be a mess as they were in the transition between management and things were not very organized.  My job was not hard to perform, but the management staff made it more difficult."
good,"I enjoy working here. All associates are very awesome to work with. "
good,"Work at Best Buy was made difficult by understaffing and issues with no sick time or PTO allowed. Still, the team was close and supportive of their own and often willing to help. Management, unfortunately, was not a team; they often butt heads, all of them had extremely different means of team leading, and very different visions for how the store should be run. This led to lots of confusion and communication issues between employees and the management team."
good,"They do not value outside of company perspective."
good,It's just another retail job. Politics in the store. Pushed to sell like you're on commission but you aren't. Great discount. Decent schedule outside of holidays.
good,Best Buy is a good place to work especially if you're looking for a job while in school or looking for flexible hours. I worked at Best Buy for 3 years and the job itself wasn't bad it's the managers that made work dreadful for me.
good,Because of management the work place is a classic toxic work environment. I would not reccomend working here to anyone. Because of the toxic work place and high stress I lost my job. They do play favorites if your buddies you get promoted. Dont disagree with the warehouse manager she will find a way to push you out.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"my experience at best buy was a bit of an outlier because i was extremely good at customer service and sales. i always met my goals without much effort and customers were never hard for me to handle. i worked in 3 different stores and the culture was always the same. "
good,It was a fast paced sales environment. Always have numbers to hit and management stresses that because thats how your store and management bonuses. Big on getting credit card applications.
good,I was the Asset Protection Lead at this location so I had to stay alert not only for customers but employees as well. I had to initiate investigations regarding lost or stolen electronics
good,"Work and life balance for someone starting out in retail is fun and easy. I didn't learn much because I saw as the winter season passed on they were teaching others and during that time I learned I was not being kept. The culture of the job didn't feel like an actual job, I even walked into the job like I was selling cars, like dress shoes and dress pants along with the uniform polo. The only reason why I gave management two stars is because a female supervisor hit on me, however the other management personnel were not the best, there was even a manager that is racist."
good,I have no comment to place regarding my employment at best buy. The fact I am having to do this review just to use this site is preposterous and troublesome.
good,"The company overall isn't so bad. The management is not in tune with employees. They do not care about the employees, only business needs are honestly cared for. The pay for the actual job needs to be more and they cap your pay very quickly."
good,"Good job scanning products with a rf unit  in and out bins and on and off trailers making sure every piece  is systematically counted for ,making sure there’s no damage, using a lift which has clamps on the front used to clamp product to and from locations keeping a clean and safe environment good job until they changed the management the new managers didn’t quite know the culture"
good,"Good entry job with fun coworkers and easy customer interactions, Pay is better than most and easy upward mobility to another position within the company"
good,The hardest part of the job is having customers mad at you about something that you can’t control. There is a few mangers that I feel that could use improvement but overall I really like most of the managers. I have learned not to let rude people get under my skin and to take everything with a grain of salt.
good,"Some tasks are manageable during one day, however others are not. Learned and build new skills in communicating with managers and supervisors. Enjoyed working in other store buildings in the area."
good,"Best Buy was fun to work for but its different than any other retail job I've worked. It's beneficial with learning about the products you're selling but at least the location I worked at it was always an unfriendly  competition between employees, which was supported by management."
good,The company has become very focused on keeping up with the trends in technology and culture which brings a vibe and aesthetic to the industry that attracts buyers.
good,"I loved the people I worked with. "
good,"Took care of me for the most part, just didn't enjoy everyone from management. Fun work environment for a little while. Too much work for so little pay."
good,Overall Best Buy great company to work for. They have good benefits and hourly wages. Getting full time can be difficult. I personally was not able to stay with them long due to pregnancy difficulties.
good,Best buy was a grear starter job for me and carrier advancement wish I would of stayed longer with the company would love to work for them again good luck
good,"The people make the job, and if you get to comfortable you will be there forever.Moving up is all depending on who has been there longer than you and if they applied for it or not, Benefits and 401k are surprising good. But hours are all over the place and life balance will suffer."
good,"Worked there for almost 9 years, Holidays are not good for home life but the time spent interacting with customers will gain you valuable people skills you will need later in life."
good,"Discrimination against women capable of doing the same or better as men and consistently passed over for promotions"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,politics is the only way to advance. it's not who you know or what you know;it's how much they like you. the only chance for advancement is to be friendly with friends of management. to sum it up; if you and the leaders hang out after work you'll go far.
good,"Was a sales representative in college as a part time job. I was taking 17 credits and needed something that could help pay rent. Flexible hours helped, very micromanaged, this job was not a priority at that time."
good,"Best Buy and Geek Squad has a great culture. Working there you can make lifelong friends who will bring you along with them in their success. Working retail is never pleasant, but Best Buy tries to find ways to make it tolerable."
good,Geek Squad was a great work environment. You must have knowledge of computer repairs already because the training isnt that great. Nice environment though.
good,"i enjoyed my time there for the most part. it allowed flexibly as i was in college. It is a non commission sales environment. However, they are productivity based. It all depends on the manager if i'm being honest."
good,"Poor pay but Learn a lot of skills you can use your later on. The job will teach you a lot about many different things, relating to all their products."
good,Best Buy is all about change in an effort to remain competitive in an every changing market place.  Life at DDC #75 is fast paced and rewarding due to the companies emphasis on values and employee engagement.  Compensation and benefits are on par for the industry but work life balance often suffers due the cyclical nature of the business.
good,"Learned a lot about my field as a remote tech agent"
good,"Working there was sometimes fun depending on who you work with, management was sometimes ok and the work was heavy sometimes with little pay not enough staff."
good,"Would work ten hour plus work days as a phone operator and would not be allowed any lunch or bathroom breaks. Management never checked on us to see if we were okay, and in reality were just the stores grunt workers who were not respected or appreciated."
good,"A typical retail job. Pay is okay. Hours are grueling as you have to work weekends and holidays. Benefits are okay, the main attraction being an employee discount."
good,Great started job for young person who is going to college and needs a small job to maintain. Manageable hours and small pay to get by. Friendly work environment
good,"Best Buy is a very tough company. Though I did meet some very good managers and people with the company, they can also feel threatened very easily. If you have any sort of management education or business education and relate it to the work place, they seem to find a way to punish you. They don't want to be shown up as if they would lose their job to a potential person who could do a better job."
good,"I owe Best Buy for the personal skills it has offered me. The sales, customer service and tech knowledge that Best Buy has gifted me allowed me to build a platform which has opened me to many opportunities."
good,"I went to work every day, hopefully expecting a full time position.  In the end, there was not a full time position available.  I was covering for an employee who was out. Was promised a full time position.  Nothing came about"
good,Best Buy is a company that strives to be the best big company of the electronics world. As a part of management its very important to keep employees safe from what is rolling down from corporate.
good,I was actually suprised about how less scary this retail job was going to be. I found working at Best Buy to be an enjoyable time until I basically became the manger without pay. There is no oppurtunity to go up in the company as the mangers do not tend to leave bby.
good,"I worked with some great people and learned a lot about different technology. They could compensate their employees better. Working most employees, even leaders, less that 28 hrs to ensure no benefits and eliminating positions employees could move into is a good way to ensure your employees are less than motivated to so their job. No reward for the employee leaves no incentive for them to do well"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I worked this job as a senior in high school to help pay for my car. It paid that bill. Managers are nice, inconsistent hours unfortunately. I would recommend this job to a student pursuing school."
good,Best Buy is all around a decent company. It has all the latest tech and new gadgets at your disposal. It's great atmosphere to be in as a customer. But working as a sales associate for best buy was very eye opening to say the least.
good,Normal day to day operation at a retail location such as this one are not easy as you are bombarded with customers looking for support for their technology or get express their disbelief when not given that support.
good,"A typical day at Best Buy is being there at 5:30am in the morning, (which is perfect for me) having a small meeting soon as we get there. "
good,"Working as a project team member, the people I worked with were fantastic and the actual work I found to be fun. It was a lot of lifting, working with my hands, installing, and destruction of old displays."
good,Fast paced very demanding fun place to work.Always busy loved working black friday. Only con is you are required to work on thanksgiving day and miss dinner.
good,"it is good place to work, management is good, I would like to stay more if my contract will be extend. Team I work with is a great team and finally, I enjoy working there."
good,"Pulling merchandise for shipping,pick ups or delivery. Load and unload trucks. Drive big joe for retrieving merchandise . I learned about electronics. All types of cultures work there. The hardest part of job is finding lost merchandise. The people who work there are very team work oriented."
good,The best thing about working at Best Buy is the people.  I would not have stayed with the company for as long as I have (6 years) if it weren't for the amazing people I've gotten to work with and the professional relationships I've developed with my customers.
good,Grande Compagnie mais malheureusement les employés sont très mal payés...
good,its a nice place for a first time job once you get the understanding of it . very fast pace environment  need to keep up with customers not set to a certain station
good,"Best buy can be a great place to work but if you will work with employees who have been there long enough that they become comfortable,lazy and unprofessional, so if you can withstand taking more responsibilities due to tenure then you can succeed. Black friday horrible hours"
good,"Along with technology the strategy to sale is also fickle over time. "
good,"Best Buy and Geek Squad are good companies to work for. The policies and processes are clear and allow all employees to excel, if they choose to. The real issue is that upper management at the store and district levels tend to do their own thing and can cause conflict with staff who are working hard to uphold company wide standards."
good,"definitely a good resume builder job but does not reward you for the effort given, should be commission for sales.  Pushing financing is a tough job especially when your performance depends on it."
good,"I learned a lot about technology that I didn't know before. "
good,"Competitive environment and job is very interesting because you get to learn new things almost everyday you step foot into the work place."
good,"The managers are very friendly, if you're looking for a part time job and are familiar with electronics you'll do well in this position. In geek squad you're going to be working with a small team, usually 3-5 people including a manager."
good,"amplio rango de horarios, buen ambiente laboral, muy buen compañerismo,"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The secret to a happy career at Best Buy is to find an excellent manager/team and follow their career. There are many pockets of frustrated employees and many pockets of happy professionals. Network internally often and listen carefully for the top talented teams. Many middle managers are struggling against audacious goals from leadership and revolving resource constraints on their teams. Caught in the middle of a difficult directive and challenging landscape. Some fight for success. Others leave.
good,good place to work for if you are looking for good discounts on their products but pay is horrible expect too much in return of the small pay they have. no advancement in the company unless you are a teachers pet for the management a lot of favoritism in the office
good,Decent place to work salary is not great mainly best to work their for the discounts. Management is not that great as well but the people you work with on the field are much more fun.
good,"Due to the electronics business being so affected by online sales the job market has slowly disappeared.  There are no more positions that work on commission which would offset the fact that they don't offer any benefits to lower class management.  Not that Best Buy offered commissions, but I enjoyed working with the corporate office from The Woodlands, TX location.   I enjoyed working with customers but no room for growth."
good,"Great place to work, learned alot about safety and theft awareness. Management was great learned a lot from them. Hours varied, some 40 plus weeks than down to 8 hour week."
good,Feel like everyone shows a little favoritism. Only people that do advance are people that they like ans hang with outside of work . Managers hang out with employees but overall fun work environment.
good,"Best buy has a very upbeat and fast working environment and co workers of all kinds. I wish the communication level from manager to employee was better. Initially I applied for a part time position with Best Buy, but received a position for part time seasonal."
good,"A typical day at work was generally greeting customers, directing them towards a product or helping them to decide upon a product if they needed help. I learned a great deal about computers and other pieces of technology that I otherwise would've never known. The management was okay, but they were too focused on pushing things on customers that the customers just weren't interested in. That's really what drove me personally away. The culture in the store was amazing, everyone got along great and not just in each department but as a collective whole the entire store got along great which made it easier. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management team nagging about getting credit card sign ups and other things they were pushing. The most enjoyable part of course would be the team. Absolutely amazing people, extremely knowledgeable and very passionate about their products in their respective departments (and sometimes other departments)."
good,"I personally enjoyed Best Buy but there were a few things that make it difficult for me to make it as a career. "
good,"Best Buy is a great company to work for, they offer a lot of employee perks and growth in the company. On the other hand they could to a better job investing in training for their managers"
good,Provide repair and education services to clients on PCs and work/home environments.  Meet a variety of people from all walks of life in a structured culture inside a retail environment.
good,Have been working there for 4 years they will give promotions to their favorites over deserving folks. Overall though love the actual people aside from management there they make it worth working for. Helps you like technology otherwise it's just another job for others.
good,A people person would love this job because it is great to talk to people who need help with all kinds of different things and being able to meet all types of different groups.
good,best buy is a good company. unfortunately the management that was at my store was not a positive and professional one. as a company best buy is a good company
good,"a typical dat at work at Best Buy normally consist of more than a few steps to get the store ready for customers and has a twist of, normally what was lost or stolen who had the max sales rep of the past day and to always push BBY GeekSquad Protection."
good,"Day to day life with best buy was busy but rewarding. Worked with a lot of good people and was exposed to new opportunities for personal growth.  The most stressful part of the job, was dealing with the fast pace of the day."
good,"Walk up to customers on the floor and try to sell them warranties. "
good,"Not very friendly environment. Once you know the job it is been left upon you to do everything, All other customer service employees just slack off and leave you to do all the work. if you do not do it then its left there and you will be going home late cause you have to finish before you leave."
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Best Buy. It was tough at times, but I am still friends with a lot of the people I used to work with there, both from general staff and from management."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The store I worked in was fun, the people were friendly and the benefits were great. There were good leadership and lackluster. For the most part the store was a good experience, minus the favoritism."
good,Great co-workers. Very team oriented. Great supervisors. Met some life long friend here. Taught me more about technology. Learned life lessons here.
good,This was where I learned most of my customer service skills. I learned how to socialize with people and what I most enjoyed was having co workers to talk to.
good,An overall great experience. Great management and teamwork. Friendly work environment and easy. Only requirement is basic knowledge of your product and be people friendly
good,"shifting hours"
good,"Work environment wasn't too bad, long shifts of standing & walking. Management was horrible. When i needed appropriate keys to obtain locked up product for customers, all radios were silent for long periods of time, so the customer had to wait for a long time."
good,"Good work environment. The hardest part about my job was in the back of the house loading and unloading boxes of merchandise. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and interacting with customers. My typical work day was very productive."
good,"I loved Best Buy when I first started, I was promoted quickly for my hard work and results.  When new management from outside the state came in and recruited managers from their previous district things changed for the worse.  They were not used to our culture and did not try to adapt.  They wanted us to adapt to them.  It became very unhealthy.  A lot of experienced and talented leaders left or were let go."
good,"Best Buy pushes employees to retain the massive product knowledge needed in order to provide the best, unmatched, customer service available. Additionally, managers and coworkers will provide help selling strategies and techniques. The combination of both of these attributes is incredibly useful for a variety of future careers and positions."
good,"Best Buy is a great and fun place to work."
good,It was a very fun job the atmosphere was great the discount was great at times also . The management at times could have been overwhelming but the company's vision was headed in the right direction.  Some of the managers where loved by there employees and then others wasn't. Black Friday was the worst . The employees had no life. This is a good job for somebody who has no kids.
good,"Sometimes its slow, and when you ask to help with something else management doesn't want you to help your other co-workers. Very stress full, must be on your toes at all times, I like that always on the move. Not good with Health-care offer for workers, co-workers do not work well together, when I try to help co-workers they seen taken aback. co-workers here seen as if they are not happy with their job.."
good,Every day was something different at Best Buy as a Project Team member. Those with flexible thinking and patience would do well in this position but the work/life balance for those seeking to further education left something to be desired.
good,I pride myself on doing what I do the best that I can. I dont like working hourly there is just no way that one can be properly appreciated. I have alot of skills and know how but it just never seems to be enough. I was not chosen to continue working through the year.
good,The hardest part of the job is working as a team in trade off shifts where the first person may or may not get all the responsibilities completed whereas they then fall on next lead.
good,this is something that is just part of best buy in general with all of the  rapid change and lack of accountability its hard to feel like you are wanted as a part of the team. the employees are the main reason i have stayed there so long because i love my team. the management is the main reason I'm looking to get out of there there is no accountibility so you cant expect to be praised or reprimanded for any of your work and if you fail to meet any expectations the entire team is punished.
good,"Management was horrible. They never were on the same page, would get multiple answers for the same question. They go off of tenure not merit."
good,"la culture et l'ambiance de l'entreprise est bonne, mais ne réponds pas à mes attentes de carrière et salariale."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Good place to work, alot of exciting and engaged individuals. I work for Geek Squad and my team is great. I am always trying to progress and I just want more for myself."
good,This is a place where your sales skill can blossom. This place is great for getting in touch with customers and building long term customer experience.
good,For a Big Box store running part time employees is the smart way to go.  The culture is great but it is not somewhere you are likely to make a career because if the full time positions are taken you are never going to get ahold of one.
good,No room for advancement no matter ow hard you worked. I wanted opportunities for growth and here there are none. The boss was fantastic however and very encouraging
good,On an average day i worked 4-8 hours selling home theater supplies. My coworkers were polite as was management. It was straight foreword and fairly easy.
good,Decent wages and benefits. Nice co workers although management can be difficult to get a hold of sometimes. Also not very good training available.
good,"Co-workers and customers made work engaging, fun and different everyday however managament made it unbearable to work"
good,"This was a good place to work, as long as you didn't work the morning shift. A lot of the times, I would go in at 6am and be asked to go home by 8am. My paychecks got to the point where they weren't even enough to pay one bill."
good,It is hard to advance in this company. You pick up good skills and the atmosphere is relaxed. You are more likely to move laterally.
good,Great job. Actually opened up a new store but it closed down due to not making enough money. Learned how to drive a manual box truck.
good,"I started working at Best Buy as their Asset Protection Lead Associate.  This job entails the safety and security of both consumers and employees to meet daily safety goals. Also, it includes the management of multiple CCTV cameras, radio communication devices and alarm system throughout the building was constantly scrutinize to ensure its reliability.  Usually, as an Asset Protection, we serve as the first line of defense and also as a greeter, checking in and checking out consumer merchandise to minimize shrink.  "
good,"During my time with Best Buy my daily routine would be trying to figure what can actually get accomplished in one day. Although I am a very organized person, the company still gives out way to much work to be accomplished in one day or week. Many time they will send out a ""playbook"" that is a hundred pages with very little direction on how to execute. Many of the management felt the same way as the company was being run by the new CEO transition a couple years ago. The good thing about this company is that most employees have a passion to work there because of the the technology."
good,"Lifting was the hardest part."
good,There was a lot of fanfare before opening but as time wore on too many management and workers were caught stealing. As such there was a lot of turmoil over who it was or could have been.  In other words a lot of pointing fingers. I left because my mother had a stroke and my two sisters were busy with their families at that time.
good,"I loved working this job until, the change in management went out the window, I Had won numerous awards and accolades in the time I worked for this company. met a slew of incredible people and I am eternally greatful for the experiences and accomplishments over the years."
good,it was a great place to work while in school but too many stay too long and drink the kool-aid.  They do have decent benefits but forget having a life around the holidays or being able to be with family.
good,"no room for growth, very flexible with your schedule, interesting though if you would like to learn a lot about electronics."
good,"It was a great first job, Fun People"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a great place to work if you have the privilege of working for a Management team that cares about their employees. I have worked for many different managers and have seen them range from poor to excellent. The job atmosphere is great if you like meeting new customers on a daily basis and being surrounded by the latest trends in technology.
good,"Theres a lot of learning involved in this company since you're getting new tech every couple of months.  You have to remember that the new processor in the computers is great for editing pictures, but might not be so great for gaming."
good,"The only downside was the late nights because the sales associates were required to help stock the floor since there was a separate job title for it. Otherwise, I had a great starting pay for having had no experience, although it was seasonal employment."
good,managers did not seem to care a lot about the difference between excellent customer service and okay customer service which really bothered me.
good,I really enjoyed working with the people there until the management changed and then the locations thoughts changed from helping the customer to getting products out the door. The old model was so much better.
good,"I've worked for the Geek Squad for over 3 years. The position has not changed much, but management has consistently declined. On paper, my primary responsibilities include heading up computer and device repair (hardware and software) and communicating repair statuses to clients. Currently, no supervisor or manager above me has ever worked for the Geek Squad. They insist I prioritize selling services or greeting clients (positions filled by other agents). Management is 100% sales oriented and has little to no idea how to handle the services industry. "
good,"My typical day at work is creating customer bonds by making people feel like I'm just another person not just someone who is trying to sell them something. Management is okay they only usually have 2managers working in a day and they are spread super thin so they are hard to get a hold of when needed. Some of my coworkers are pretty cool, laid back, and help when needed. There really isn't a hard part. I just love working with people."
good,"Started as a PT job for college and the company has taken me all over the country. Great ideal work environment, that can cause stress but ultimately an outstanding company"
good,"easy to learn how to work there. was a first job right out of high school, and good as a part time, not a career"
good,This is an easy job for the most part. The hardest thing about it is digging into the already packed boxes pulling out enough product to make sure all the numbers are matching with no mixed product. Then making sure to repack it so the line worker isn't mad at the mess you made of their neatly stacked product.
good,I loved working here. They were a great team that eventually felt like family. If it weren't for the fact that they did not have a benefits package and guaranteed 40 hours a week I would still be there.
good,"Good place to work for, turnover is a little high."
good,Best Buy is a great place to work.  The culture cannot be beat.
good,It was a fun place to work but not a career. It was a good job for when a was younger.
good,Bestbuy provides good learning experience. However it also depends on the manager to make the work place little bit more easy for front line employee.
good,"I usually work with customers to develop solutions to their technological needs. The most difficult part of the job is initially building a rapport with total strangers almost immediately. It's all about being able to make people feel comfortable with you."
good,Fun place to work but wouldn't make it my career.Mangers were fun but played favorites.
good,"Watched cameras and deterred theft. Coworkers were good and understanding, management was less than desirable."
good,"Geek Squad is a great place to leave entry-level PC helpdesk support. You learn about virus removal, PC tune-ups, managing operating systems, and some PC hardware related repairs. My manager is great and has been a good mentor. The hardest part of the job is resolving issues with agitated clients. The best part of the job is working in what is known as the ""Geek Squad"" culture."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"•	Complete transactions at register – via cash, check and bank card"
good,"The most important part of working at Best Buy is to remember to push the services Best Buy provides: Credit card, protection plan, extended services. They don't fully train you about the products, they just expect you to know it already."
good,"I greatly enjoyed the culture and principles of this company. The main reasons I left were poor work/life balance, and compensation was not competitive in the industry."
good,I work at Best Buy mostly in the gaming section. The training was a huge drag and I still technically am not fully trained. They just needed someone to talk to people in gaming to make sure everyone was being helped. Management is pretty mediocre. Hiring process took around a month and a half to complete. Don't expect to start working until a few weeks after a job offer.
good,"repair and diag computers, help with sales, ship and receive, deal with internal insurance adjusters"
good,"Working with customers, need to reach goals.  Management is very management like, easy on the floor and extremely hard in meetings.  you NEED to get these goals"
good,"Depending of the BestBuy and the people that you work with it can be an ok job or even fun at times."
good,"inventory AR"
good,Poor communication resulted in poor management. At times you would do more than asked but never felt recognized or grateful for your actions
good,Opening and Upgrading customers accounts. Demonstrated new technology to customers and explained in detail any questions to customers. Always did my job with a focus of total customer satisfaction.
good,Great Place to work. Some Good Managers. Great Discount. Great People work there.
good,"I do reports in the morning telling everyone what is on my bench and has left the bench. I complete repairs on peoples computers to the highest of standards and hold others to the same value."
good,Typical day at work involved assisting customers with general laptop/desktop issues when they came into the store. 
good,"There is always hard work going on, The pay is great but the line management does need to have more training on the job before they take over a line because their mistake will cost you your job"
good,Video Merchandising could be tedious at times. It is a teamwork effort. Management as well as other departments work as a team.I enjoyed helping customers and providing for myself a job that I enjoyed going to.
good,"Resolve customer issues, coach and train employees, manage inventory and stock levels, receive trucks, process all product incoming and outgoing.  Responsible for business plans, process implementation, employee reviews and documentation. "
good,"It was an amazing job to have for the holiday season.  Management communicated very poorly, training was based on the floor and by co-workers only."
good,"a typical day at work was always something new to learn. learning was an everyday experience, from cross training the sales floor, to service orders, to shipping and receiving,admin office work, management was not the best, when they were needed, ""keys/customer exchange,signoff"" my coworkers we all always had each others back. it was always about team work and that's what made the job even better. the hardest part was leaving my job. the most enjoyable part. was the company business trips."
good,management was terrible the only real problem I had with them
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"My day typically consists of taking care of any urgent issues, then proceeding with my usual duties, such as creating reports and coaching employees. I learn new things on a daily basis and am encouraged to do so. My supervisor is supportive and encouraging. However, upper management tends to be inconsistent and communication could be better. The hardest part of my job would have to be seeing employees make bad decisions that may affect them long term. I enjoy the daily interactions with people and dealing with a variety of situations."
good,"Management is NOT organized at all, I think that better management will lead the Geek Squad forward and make customers happier with the results."
good,"There are plenty perks at best buy. Great employee recognition with path excellence programs. Plenty of training to any employee at anytime. But the thing that will make or break your overall experience is the management style in your particular location. In the mansfield location it is very up and down certain managers are better to work for and with than other. I have been with the company and store for almost 3 years, it has been overall a fun, and good experience."
good,"It's a nice place to work, very clean and up beat. part-timers dont always get headsets and aren't allowed to carry keys which is tiresome and irritating on a busy day. the E-learnings are really helpful, as well as the coachings you do with other employee's. overall now bad. Don't be later though. Ever."
good,"I love working at Best Buy merely for the people that I work with and the fact that I love helping people. I love working and doing more for my company, but it would be nice to be praised for it once and a while."
good,Talking to tons of different clients in a day and solving their needs.
good,It's an okay place to work. Unless you've been working there for a few years there isn't any room for advancement (at least at my Best Buy).
good,"A typical day of work consisted of constantly interacting with customers and trying to find the right products for them. Closing duties at night time such as restocking and making sure the product was arranged properly were also done. I learned selling skills and how to interact with customers and find what they are looking for. My co-workers were fun for the most part, but you don't really get to interact with them much due to the fact that most of your day is spent with customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure you meet your sales goals. It's very stressful and makes you realize there is a big difference between pushing and offering. The most enjoyable part of the job was using the cash register, i just found it fun and easy for me to do and understand."
good,"This position taught me a lot. I leardned how to print labels, set up displays and all about stock at Best Buy."
good,"My typical day of work would start at 3:00 am going to warehouse and picking up all the orders customers have done, after that would be delivering to all the zip codes where the clients would live and installing the appliances. I learned to manage electronics. I really did not have co-workers only one, it was great spending time with him and learning from him. The hardest would be takeing washers or refrigerators to upper levels when they did not had elevators but besides from that it was really awesome."
good,Great company to work for. Inconsistencies with SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) per store basis.
good,"Loved working with Best Buy, Interaction with customers was always great. Hardest part of the job is the managers"
good,The only reason I left Best Buy was to accept a position in EMS>
good,Average retail job with some great people
good,"I've learned how to keep inventory always in stock and fill other orders, stocking and up stocking extra product, use a CCTV. Hardest part of my job is standing in a cctv box for the amount of hours and only being relieved for lunch but not given many chances for shorter breaks."
good,a typical day would have me counting inventory or opening up the register. What I learned there was it was like any other company nothing special. The management was personable to new employees. My co-workers were so nice and wiling to hang out after work. The hardest part about this job was staying at the register when I wanted to walk around the store. The most enjoyable part the morning huddles.
good,"On floor sales. We communicated via walkie talkies and call outs to differant departments, if you were qualified and not busy with a customer you were expected to answer the call. The entire shift ebb and flowed between working with customers, restocking, cleaning and e-learnings. I learned that people in a major sales session with a salesperson are typically insecure feeling inside but show rejection on the outside. Finding out what the real reason they are even looking at that washing machine, then developing repoire with the customer are the key to breaking that fear barrier. There always seemed to be a senior co-worker available for help and floor management was always circulating. The hardest part of the job was closing very large valued purchases. The most enjoyable was again working and conversing with customers."
good,The best part to working at Best Buy was working with a great team. We all got a long well and because of that we were very successful.
good,The managers are workers were always fun people to be around with always made the day interesting.
good,The job was ok for someone who just finished college. It sharpened my people skills so that I could have great communication with each customer.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy can be an amazing atmosphere. A place you feel appreciated and you can learn to grow yourself and others. Problem is that this experience is tied to your location and manager. I have spent time with managers of all levels within the company and most have TOO strong of an opinion on what they are doing is great. They are stuck on the growth the company achieved 5 years ago and not on recent retail trends. They don't appear to care for outside opinions and love to promote the people that have bought into their system. This creates a fake culture. From the outside it looks great. From the inside of the management team it appears great. Everyone else though, which is Supervisor down to line levels, feels the separation. They notice something is wrong but don't speak up because they either feel they don't have a voice or they don't want to rock the boat. Why risk damaging one of the best treated and highest paid retail jobs? Progress will change Best Buy, but they will lose a lot of great people on the way."
good,Typical day at work was unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Learned how demanding the job is but i liked it a lot. How to deal with different areas of sales. Hardest part of the job was being careful and to make sure everything was secured and priced properly. Most enjoyable was the staff. Most disliked was management which is the reason i had left.
good,This job is great if you go to school.  Its also a great place for new hires to get experience at working.  I started this job in 2005 and like any jobs have had my ups and downs but it has been mostly positive.
good,"Best Buy is great, if you don’t plan to do anything else. Unfortunately it’s extremely easy to get trapped. Constantly promised the option to move up but never can"
good,"One of the best retail chains to work for. Great pay for retail but work-life balance can become an issue. Also, the workplace environment depends on what location you work for."
good,All in all its a great place to learn about new technologies and great job culture but they are extremely negligent in terms of employee well being and school balances if you fall into that category. I speak from a part time perspective
good,"As someone who was in school when I was initially hired on it was great. They were flexible with my hours and had good benefits. When I was done with school and wanted to advance it was hard. Getting a pay raise was not hard (if you did your job) but they pay scale was low so I had to get a second job somewhere else and work overtime to be able to pay my bills, and even then it was still a struggle."
good,Feel the company can care more about there employees. More room for growth in the company. The company is a good company just need some improvement within .
good,"After working at BestBuy for 4 years and moving around in the company."
good,"It was a good place to work, it exposes you to customers and clients.You get to meet and interact with a whole lot of people, and you get a better understanding of what they want first hand."
good,Face paced in the warehouse. Fun and competitive. Over time it is very nice. You get a nice check if you work for it and work over time. Chance to get hired full time at the end of the  job. No drink at your work station sucks.
good,It was fine. I did not feel like I was given a lot of opportunities to use my skills to the test until I was on the phones. I enjoyed the aspect of being cross trained and able to assist in multiple areas.
good,"As a company Best Buy was great. As for working Loss Prevention, trying to effect change was impossible. Loss Prevention is responsible for things like Key tracking and monitoring the areas where theft happens more often. Can't track keys because they are passed out before Asset Protection arrives in the morning and is not signed out. Can't leave your monitoring area without being relieved. Managers do not stay on their department about carrying radios, so if Asset Protection calls for a walk thru of an area then there is a 50% chance anyone will have a radio and will actually go. Hardest part of the job was trying to maintain an open line of communication."
good,"Offered to stay after black friday season; didn't hate myself enough to stay. Is ideal as a temp job, I actually had fun working with my team! Store has a big turnover rate and more than half my team left once I left in January, still made good memories and opened my eyes to the retail world. Would not stay because of poor management."
good,It’s an amazing company as far as benefits. But some of the locations seem to have the “good ole boys” club mentality. Off topic your pay is negotiable & you go through 3 interviews before hired.  Definitely not much opportunity to grow unless your a favorite. However I met a lot of amazing people at this company and to this day I have gained a couple of great friends because of the opportunity I had working there. When I first started I had a wonderful GM but once he left the store from an operational perspective went to bleep....
good,"6/10 - Management could have been better, job description could be more active and involved in other experiences within the company. Felt like my department (asset protection) was an outsider and was a cast out."
good,"Fun job but loaded me with full time hours as a part time employee that also was going to school, so it made it hard to focus on school which was the reason for why I left the company."
good,"I loved working at Best Buy. Honestly, if pay and management had been better, I wouldn’t have left. The discount is awesome, the coworkers are great, and it just had a good atmosphere."
good,Management there will ruin your experience. The customers are awesome and the environment at BestBuy really makes it worth while. The employee discount isnt all that great and no there is not any commission. It was done away with back in 2013. But hey you'll at least get to check out the newest tech available in your local area.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Tons of work for inventory during the Holiday season with borderline oppressive work schedules. If others aren't pulling their weight, it makes the entire shift a living nightmare. Other than that, fantastic work experience."
good,"Although it's a good place to work, and can seem like they cater to specific races over others. Management sides with employees that have been employed here longer than others. Coworkers can be outright rude and won't say something as simple as excuse me to get pass, but management blames it on a language barrier."
good,No place for advancement or learning new skills for part timers which is unfortunate.  Schedule agreement when hired does not necessarily mean that will be followed through with making for frustration and constant schedule changed.
good,"Best Buy was a great place to learn how to sale, however with pay structure and fast turn over rate, valuable sales associates were unrecognized. Best buy focused on quantity over quality in their sales team."
good,"Decent, advancement for women did not happen quickly at all as opposed to men which was my main reason for leaving. I really liked my job and fellow co-workers but was not given a raise for 2 years and was unable to move within the company."
good,"I've worked with the best of people, and I've worked with the worst. The best make up for lower pay, and the worst drive you to find higher pay. Internal employees receive preference on advancement, but stores show loyalty to themselves. If you try to advance through another store, good luck. They'll likely tap one of their own people long before you."
good,The company as a whole is amazing and moving in the right direction. Individual stores however are very political and favoritism matters. Great place in general to learn about business acumen and overall fun environment.
good,"Best Buy certainly has ups and downs, just like any business. But when you have management that has a ""never good enough"" mentality, your employees suffer. It feels as if no matter what you do, they always find some flaw within either the way you sold something just even down to missing a 5$ attachment cord or adapter. When your employees don't feel like what they will do will please their managers, they don't have drive to keep pushing and making the company grow and get better. When a work force has a collective feeling of dread and dissatisfaction with their employer, nothing can move forward because the sales stop coming in, and the attach rates go down, and the services fall off, because no one believes in the things they sell. That is where Best Buy suffers the most in my opinion"
good,Senior Management working hard to move the company in the right direction but it is a very competitive business.  Interesting place to work for a business major. Feels like a Policies 400 level class.
good,Only issue was that they HR in MN is very strict. Such a big company could stand to benefit from a training and development team. To teach folks the set up.
good,"I would call this the beginning of a career, I began as a part time associate and climbed to supervisor rather quickly, I enjoyed the people I worked with and worked for. I learned a ton about managing both employees and customers"
good,"The job is really good for entry level employees but the nature of retail really isn’t for everyone. It’s very hard to get certain days off especially weekends and holidays and especially if you’re full time. Benefits are great if you’re full time, you get 3 and a half weeks PTO full medical coverage, 401k, tuition assistance and many more nit to mention how great the disciunts are for everyone. The management almost always play favorites and this can be a big factor in your promotions."
good,"The information of products and customer interaction was the highlights of the job also interacting with other employees and becoming friends was a benefit. However, there was little potential for advancement even if there were multiple positions open and management was inconsistent in their efforts and expectations."
good,"I had an interesting time working for Best Buy, co workers were great. Shifts were fluctuating well if you were Full Time, but if you were Part time. You were given lingering shifts that would barely have you in the store."
good,I would work a night shift followed by a morning shift. If i needed time off it was difficult to receive. At the time i was longest tenured employee in my department and a new guy that never had a job came in and made more then me. I applied many times for full time only to end up training the full timer.
good,"•	Bestowed optimistic customer experiences with Magnolia Home Theater installation that reinforced positive relationships and loyalty with Best Buy. "
good,Best Buy was a great place to work during and after finishing college. The pay is decent for a retail job. Hours were competitive based on the time of the year. Being a salaried manager during the holidays was by far the worst part of the job. Expected to work 6-7 days a week 10 plus hours a day for a couple months without seeing anything more than your 40 hour a week pay check.
good,"I have been at Best Buy for about 2 years. Things are good and you meet a lot of great people. The biggest issue least in my store is poor management, work life balance, and at times a lack of recognition. Don't get me wrong I do like my job and would still recommend working for this company because of the people and the opportunity for advancement but where I am currently located that isn't really the case and I know we are not the only store to have these issues."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,It is a great company to work for but need to look out for your coworkers and management as they will throw you under the bus if they don't like you. Other then that my favorite company that I worked for.
good,My typical day would consist of coming to work and maintaining a constant vigil over the entire store. I learned that thieves can look like anyone. My management was always nice and professional to me. The culture was upbeat and people often looked forward to being there.
good,"I worked there for three years. It wasn't worth it, but it gave a good security over time. There was little advancement over time. I liked the workers, and the work was usually slow and casual. A lot of the workers were laid back. I would only recommend it if you were a good salesman."
good,Manager not cooperative. Extremely bossy definitely not a leader. Hired some employees from another location as a senior disrupting the employee culture. They push you to sell Total Tech support and the credit cards. I couldnt tell if I signed up for a competitive pushy sales job or as a geek squad agent. Customer interaction is horrible at the precint. They expect you to know everything. Geek Squad Consultation Agents are not advanced repair technicians. We are not expected to know as much as them. But the customers dont understand this. Other than that it was pretty cool given that its an entry level job.
good,Fun coworkers. customers and regional managers sucked. They corporate portion of management was not very good. The store managers were good. The company did not care about the employees
good,"A lot of complaints I have fallen to the wayside as I remember I've worked for more scummier and worse jobs before then with Best Buy. That being said like all work places it honestly varies from place to place on how well your experience will go, unfortunately, the Best Buy I've worked for was lacking in leaders and co-workers. Left my department to take most of the blame when it came to short comings for the store. There is a heavy Sales Floor Vs Inventory Team vibe at least at my store and a few questionable things said from upper management even above my store I've overheard a few times. As far as drama goes though it comes and goes in waves which is more then I can see for some other places, isn't a bad part-time gig but unless you're working a higher red band store advancement isn't easy here. The work in general is very hard a lot of its common sense and motivation based. The people are friendly most of the time and it been one of the most flexible in hour type jobs I've ever worked, for better or worse."
good,"Best Buy isn’t a bad company, just be prepared. It’s retail so forget having the holidays be enjoyable. The work/life balance is totally off in this company. I feel like most people stay for fellow employees."
good,"This used to be a great place for culture and advancement. Unfortunately, there has been a downward spiral over the years with management. "
good,I am the top Advance repair agent for my store nad i have no job security. They would rather high more people over actually try and keep what they have. Its not fair..
good,"Overall, Best Buy was a good work experience because I learned a lot on the job. Mostly on how to deal with different types of customers and tailoring my solutions to satisfy the various customers I have dealt with. The people I worked with were friendly and willing to help anyone that needed their help."
good,As a part time employee this was a great company with many perks such as product discounts. As a full time employee the amount of hours weren’t sufficient to live off.
good,Best Buy was a fun but competitive place to work. Most of the employee are really nice and bring you in like family. Best Buy was my first job and I’m thankful for them giving me the opportunity to work there.
good,"One of Best Buy’s points of pride is that their employees are not paid on commission. Employees are trained to make non-commission statements, informing customers that they are simply paid a flat rate, in an attempt to gain customer trust. This can be a great benefit to the customer, but isn’t the whole story. It’s true that most customer facing employees (like Geek Squad agents or sales staff) are not paid on commission. However, sales are still incentivized in ways that create a commission-like atmosphere. For example, managers have the opportunity to make big bonuses based off of revenue/margin goals. Lower level employees can hit Blue Crew Bucks (a bonus tacked onto a paycheck). And, some employees (like Best Buy For Business) receive commission on sales. None of these practices are unethical, but giving customers the impression that sales performance isn’t rewarded is simply wrong."
good,"Best Buy expects a lot of it's employees and the hours can be crazy, especially during the holidays.  But it's not bad for a retail job.  I'd recommend for anyone in college."
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work for, however, the pay was unusually low for the amount of sales driven.  Training is decent but Best Buy is more numbers based.  They push and push sales goals.  At times it makes it very difficult because you are forced to selling things that may not exactly be in the best interest of the customer."
good,"A good place to pass time while going to school. Not really much room for advancement, very competitive amongst stores, management can be a bit demanding but that's true everywhere"
good,"Great company to work for overall, supervisor needs to pay attention to their department not just sales. Management do listen to you and want the best for you. But sometimes it takes longer to happen and always depend on a single employee to do everything."
good,I haven't worked at Best Buy in several years so my input should not have varience on what they do for their current employees. I am not sure of how things run there now.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"None of the managers talked amongst themselves and they constantly disagreed on what they wanted us to do whether us was unloading a container, reloading a container, or leaving the container alone."
good,The work environment is okay but management is a problem. The discount is nice and the CEO and shareholders hear your suggestions. Just wish Black Friday and thanks giving were not required to work.
good,"i like working here for the discounts and people"
good,"Most of the work was done by lifting, which was fine for me. It was a team oriented job, breaking down pallets of product to place on the sales floor. The managers would expect the task to be done within a curtain amount of hours, but usually we would be understaffed. It wasn't a job many people wanted to do because of what was asked for the pay that was giving. You have to consider the fact that you will be working around a lot of dusty areas and dirty boxes as well."
good,"I worked in the Geek Squad, and I enjoyed it. We were like our own little section somewhat removed from the main store. I liked wiring up vehicles and playing around with new automotive gadgets."
good,definitely the best job i had so far. i enjoyed the work pace and environment with the fellow employees. enjoyed the openness of the work day however getting promoted and getting raises was impossible and management was terrible after relocating a few times
good,Best Buy is a great job to work at for those first getting into retail and for those that need a job.  They are always hiring.  One thing I can also say is that they do a lot of training mostly on the job because its so competitive and that's how they base your work hours.  You have to come ready to be the best you can be or you might as well stay home.  The mangers are cool for the most part and can be very understanding if you need time off but if you're part time you have no benefits.  Take your time off wisely.  You can barely pay your bills with the pay if your performance isn't good.  They base the pay off of your performance as well.  Good for the business but it sucks for you.
good,"pull up emails"
good,"A typical day is clocking in and waiting for a customer to walk through your department and greeting them asking them if they have any questions about anything"
good,"I liked working at best buy, just like in any other job it has its up and it has its downs. The people that I worked with were pretty cool. Thats the reason I enjoyed it the most."
good,"The workplace culture is fast paced and energetic. You always get to try out and see new technologies.  Management always fun and has emp,overs back. Team environment."
good,I was treated nicely at Best Buy. I got along with all the coworkers there but sometimes had disagreements with the manager. I wanted to grow in Best Buy but I guess my work was not enough.
good,This was really difficult to write such low scores because this place can really push you far. I've been in 3 stores and 2 were fantastic while one was terrible. It was all due to management as well. You will have plenty of time on your hands to talk and have fun with coworkers because of the nature of retail and the size of the store BUT your hours will be entirely inconsistent and only planned two weeks out with no option to change them if anything happens. Full time employees get fantastic compensation on holidays as well but you will miss a LOT of holidays as there are many mandatory work days.
good,"work was great "
good,Good company to work for. Tons of out of work team events. Very fun group of people to work with. Room to move up in the company varying on performance.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Best Buy.  It was a good environment with awesome people!  Best Buy takes care of its employees.  I enjoyed the travel and event planning.
good,The day is very calm and there is not much to do in order to stay busy. If you are planning on a job that you can kick back and not spend much time doing actual work than this is a good fit.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a great place to start but you get paid lower than market average, and management seems to favour hiring externally vs internal promotion."
good,"Working retail has its ups and downs, Best Buy is no exception, expect to work. This is not a desk job, and definitely no 9-5 job. You will be expected to work odd shifts and uphold your sales target. Good benefits and leaderships works with you to grow within the company."
good,It rarely feels like the hard work that I'm doing is actually making a contribution because of the poor management and lack of support from coworkers.
good,"It was a great job initially until the manager left and a new one came in."
good,"Teamwork is always in question, good sense of being a part of the company. No room for growth really. Good training programs to help you advance in other positions."
good,Best Buy is a good place to work if you love technology and helping people with their electronic needs. The employees work collaboratively and help each other to help meet customers needs.
good,"You'll meet like minded people, but the retail environment and stresses associated with that can be made bearable or unbearable by a good or bad manager."
good,"Retail is retail. Every retail job has its ups and down. There is certainly stressful times and not much balance between life and work. But with so much technology, it’s hard not to keep trying to learn about new products and services. Great job for high school or college students until they want more opportunities. Compensation is not the best. Non commission based employees in a simulated commission based environment."
good,Best Buy expects a lot out of you but that is what makes it rewarding and fun. Managment at some stores is terrible and others rock so it might be worth looking into the location you are applying to
good,"Overall the majority of workers there are good people, there's a few managers who take their job a little bit too seriously for being a retail store (no surprise). Good experience with decent hours depending on your department."
good,The employees and work are great. You get to travel and see many new things and meet some great people. The work is simple once you get the proper training and it allows you to create your own schedule to a point. The down side here is the management is horrible. There is little to no communication between the staff and management. The manager for the area sets expectations to his staff that can not be achieved and they are under staffed with no spots opened by the manager. I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a fill in position but not for someone looking to make a career. At least not in this market area.
good,"The managers were very good and did their job very well. They worked my school schedule very well. The scheduling on their app was slightly complicated and I missed one sift because of the confusion, but the managers were very understandable and didn't seem to mind. I just needed money for fun during my time in college."
good,"The project team is very loosely organized.  Time spent at home and traveling can change without notice on a day to day basis.  While the benefits are great, the pay does not balance with the work aspects.  And because schedule changes happen at managers' discretion within as little as a 24 hour notice it is very difficult to find a consistent supplemental source of income."
good,"it was ok, but there was no real path for advancement. i could have been a supervisor there but they wanted me to have supervisory experience which i didn't have, that's what i was trying to get and they never gave me a chance"
good,"If you can put up with the craziness of working with the general public, the job is great. Most of the employees you work with are good, interesting people."
good,"Great place to learn and grow, however the management structure was bloated and hard to navigate. It felt like there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen so to speak."
good,"This company was a great place to solidify selling basics. Forces the employee to sink or swim but with lots of help. Never feel alone because co-workers actually help you out as opposed to trying to steal sales. No commission, but with sales quotas, at times one feels job security slipping."
good,"The best thing about working for BB is the other people you work with. They tend to hire good people. The managers are typically good people as well. It is a customer oriented business. Job security is great, advancement not so much unless you get a degree."
good,Best Buy has good pay and you get to meet a lot of people. It’s a very demanding company they really push you to hit sales targets and if you don’t then your job will be in jeopardy. But overall it’s ok
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Hours CAN be flexible depending on your perspective. 
good,The company itself needs to work on its customer service. Customers can walk around looking lost but if said customer doesn't specifically ask for help no one will help them.
good,In my history of employment Best Buy has done an awesome job at keeping customers up to date with todays latest technologies. It was a fast paced experience and i would return and recommend this employer.
good,Best Buy has been a good place to work and recognizes hard work. If you are promoted be prepared for imbalance in work/job life and the further up you go the more time you must be willing to sacrifice outside of work (including sacrificing time with your family). Most of that is just from the simple fact that Retail work is 363 days out of the year (only closed Christmas and Easter) and this is no longer a sacrifice I am personally willing to make. There are more important things in life
good,"I enjoy my time at Best Buy, however I never felt like there was never an opportunity to move up in the company while I was there. Any time a position in management opened up it was rare someone from within the store got that position. All of that aside though, the people I worked with were great, the benefits were okay, and I never had a problem that wasn't solved."
good,"This is a great entry level job. For anyone wanting sales floor experience. Performance and attendance is highly scrutinized. "
good,"The job was overall fun, because of the travel and coaching aspect of the job. Overall it helped me get through my undergrad, however difficult customer base is what is holding this place back."
good,"Management did not care about my concern and did not seem to want to help when I need assistance, very rude and was not impressed. All they cared about was getting product out and not about employees"
good,"Managers were rude, couldn't make up their mind what they wanted. "
good,Work at Best Buy was often times fun but ended up in a situation where customer service was completely forgotten and no longer had the heart to be there.  The company itself was great and benefits were a huge bonus for both full time and part time staff.
good,Most of my work at Bestbuy was self-taught unfortunately but I did learn a lot over the years of training other co-workers. Management is great and the culture is very diverse. The most enjoyable part of the job at least for me is the work itself.
good,"Micromanagement was the only real flaw. "
good,I like working here because everyone gets along and its like one big family. The managers always have your back on everything and everyone is very cooperative. Customers are usually very nice and friendly and make your day go faster.
good,Its a typical job with goals and times that need to be meet. If u are lazy its not a job for you. It was a good workout for me personally. Its a fun place sometimes
good,While working at best buy as a college student it taught me the importance of team work. We had goals to meet and as a team you wanted everyone to get there at one time.
good,BestBuy helped me learn and develop skills on how to help customers finding exactly what they are looking for. these skills are important for any future job that you acquire later on in your professional career.
good,I loved working at best buy really wished they would make me permenant but i was a contract worker. The people that worked with me were very friendly and enjoyed working with them
good,Good company. Hard to have a family working retail hours. Hard to advance career quickly. Especially if you are younger. Great benefits and plenty of hours if you are a top performer.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Overall a nice place to work for the ambitious. If you love retail it's one of the best places to work. Frequent training keeps motivated employees competent. Room for advancement. Good not great management.
good,"Pros"
good,"Best Buy was a great place to work, especially as a part time job while going to Highschool. The management was very flexible with hours and was always curtious if I needed to move days around."
good,"Best Buy was a great company to work for, but unfortunately, my direct manager was not very fair and threw me under the bus a few times when she screwed up.  I had no choice but to move on."
good,"As operation specialist, My function was to assist customers with their purchases, handle sensitive information such as credit and debit cards as well as checking account information."
good,"I love working for Best Buy and have been for three years, but i don't see any real opportunities for advancement. It seems managers already know who they want to hire for more competitive positions."
good,"No matter you are you did not seem to be just another number. because at the end of the day sometimes proved to be beneficial at times."
good,A typical work day was good. Management was reasonable with being flexible with hours and breaks as well. Co workers were nice and it was fun being around a good area.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time and experience with the company. However, horrible and unexperienced management and their workplace politics tarnished my time towards the end. It quickly became not as fun and military-like. Fun, vibrant culture was soon killed off."
good,"Aside from the terrible management the benefits suit some people’s needs. The pay is fair, and it isn’t your typical retail job that’s for sure. If they were a bit more flexible with the hours I needed because of school I might have stayed."
good,It's a pretty decent place to work at. It is what you make it there. As long as you want to do good and grow then that will happen. Make the best of yourself. You have to make it be known that you want to grow within the company or else you will remain where you are at.
good,I enjoyed my time at Best Buy but cannot agree with a leader who feels that by holding back those who he perceives as a threat to his position is not right.
good,Best Buy is a very fast paced culture that has stands on four core values that makes the company what it is today.  There are some very smart individuals at Best Buy and has a positive future outlook.
good,"The work at Best Buy is simple single step procedures; Sell. Empty. Place."
good,"Coming from a smaller environment, it was hard to get used to the inefficiencies of big box retail when implementing on site tech support for the SMB market. The hardest part of the job is saying no to extra work when your day is done. There is always a thousand things that need to be done and everyone is perpetually behind in getting things done."
good,"manage multiple projects:"
good,"only worked in store for a year was a fun job, got to travel all around the us. hours sucked because of travel but over all a fun job and i would recommend  it to anyone"
good,"Excellent company with a substantial amount of benefits, lack of proper leadership put in place and huge amounts of favoritism. lack of options for advancement"
good,The other employees there were friendly and inclusive. the food was good during the potlucks. the discounts are nice and the incentives are nice as well.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you still live at home and have no bills. Management seems to care, but ultimately is restricted by corporate interference."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Working at Best Buy definitely has advantages.  I enjoyed learning about new products and new technologies coming in the future.  The culture at best buy is very hypocritical about the goals of the business.  They start you off by saying that everything is about customer experience, but it quickly changes to meeting sales goals and making productivity above all else."
good,As your average consumer you may want to work at places that you have shopped at. Overall the place here is good to start and it may become a good place to do your career. Think it over ... it is retail equals no Christmas since you will spending at stores.
good,"Besides management being condescending and lazy, its an okay place to work. The break room is especially comfortable with recliners, a couch, and plenty of snacks to choose from."
good,"Their discount was always a huge plus. For the first 9 or so months management was great, but went downhill fast later on. The pay isn't too bad starting, but the biggest downside is their massive push for credit apps and protection policies"
good,"I learned a lot over the years I was there, however as time progressed, there was not much room for advancement and pay kind of stagnated for me. Overall was a good place, just not well structured at times. If they would actually live by one of their quotes of unleash the power of the people, and give those a chance to shine more, then maybe it could be a much better place to work.Towards the end of my time there, personal/family life became less and less important to the facility and was more geared to the corporate lifestyle."
good,Fast pace job. Easy job if you are a people person.  Typical day a work consist of stocking and helping customers solve issues (customer service). I learned that it is all about the customer and you do your best to make the customer happy.
good,"I wouldn't say Best Buy is easy to make a career out of, but it is possible. The greatest thing however that I can say you can take from it is a vast field of knowledge. If you choose to, you can learn a lot about a wide spectrum of technology. The fun and challenge of it all however is quickly fleeting (at least for me) once you've learned all there is to learn, and realize that if you want to move up and make any kind of real money, you're going to have to stick it out for the long haul, generally about 5 plus years."
good,Working there gave me an opportunity to stay on the cutting edge of technology. If you love customer service and helping people find the right solution for their issues then this is a great career path.
good,"I believed this company would be fun to work for, and for the most part, it was. However, I did not like the $ per hour quota that you had to achieve. It's not a commission job, and I'm not going to upsell a grandma on a computer, that's not me."
good,Can't have much to say. It's best buy. I had fun at parts but to be honest I couldn't stand the childish corporate environment. No free thinking and no room for growth
good,"If you like tech and going fast, this is the place. Great for singles to work, extremely tough to work in as a family person. You have goals set out each and every day, and this job is extremely faced paced, and goal driven."
good,Job was nice and depending on the store you pretty much just get to do your work and not have to do extra. Job roles are decently placed so you don't have too much work. Lunches and breaks weren't required at my stores so they were missed if you didn't want to take them.
good,Was fun and exciting. Was mostly in customer service and answering phones. I picked orders that were placed online and have them ready for customers to pick up. Checking in items and testing them. Being available for any customer to ask questions and helping to locate anything in the store. Definitely a learning experience in itself due to all the new technology you have to be tested on new upcoming items.
good,"The culture within the company is inclusive. It is a diverse company that celebrates differences and encourages its employees to share their unique perspectives. Leadership and line level associates are typically very supportive and helpful completing tasks and offering an encouraging word. There is a lot expected of you most of the time and managing multiple tasks can be difficult and stressful, especially when you are responsible for such important aspects of business. At times it seems thorough training isn't a priority but this has allowed me to push myself farther than I thought possible and become a better leader to my team. Success and hard work is rewarded through company supported initiatives and bonuses. I enjoy the reward of helping my team and fellow co-workers become better to properly support our customers each day. The list of things I have learned in my long tenure with this company is endless and invaluable."
good,Great place to learn about new tech and how to troubleshoot them. You are grossly underpaid. Can be very stressful dealing with client and catering to their needs. Need better benefits. You will build your customer service here.
good,Worked for this company for 17 years was paid extremely well for what I did. Most employees were nice and fun to work with. Company did too many changes and cut too many jobs which stressed everyone out.
good,"Geek Squad was an amazing experience in my life. I learned a lot about PC, MAC, MOBILE and TABLET devices, and much more. Would highly recommend to others searching for an entry level job in the tech field."
good,"Started out great, but management at Best Buy 1186 (Canton) took a turn for the worst right before I left. I think 1186 could be better now, but I'm not sure. I know at least 1 manager that I strongly disliked is still there."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy in general is a really good place to work. If it wasn't, I definitely wouldn't be working there still after 3 years. The benefits are amazing and coworkers tend to be really cool, fun people. However, if the management is bad then expect to dread going to work every day."
good,"Best Buy is not a career job- I will state that at the beginning of my review. Management is about average in retail from my experience, and those most capable are not always promoted. However, for part time or full time employment during high-school or college Best Buy is a wonderful place to work amid current technologies, gaining useful skills and dealing with the public and customer relations."
good,"This was a great first job, I learned a lot about technology and how to sell products. This job also taught me how to improvise since managers rarely helped with anything. I also had to deal with customers a lot and their complaints about how expensive some items were."
good,The pay was very low for the work that was given with no way to advance at the time. I have been told that it has gotten a lot better however. I really loved everyone I worked with and think of them as family.
good,I started out working at Best Buy as a part time seasonal employee and then became a full time employee after the holiday of 2007. I worked as a cashier and customer service rep along with selling on the sales floor for the Geek Squad.
good,"Its a great place to work while in college because hours are flexible. Typical day is cleaning, pretty slow, will get busy during the night time. Stay on top of your goals."
good,"A day would start out with making sure that the paperwork was filed correctly the night before and everything is up to date. Followed by printing todays paper work and working on them. going through a list of orders making sure that everything was done correctly and following up with the customer just to make sure that everything on the order is correct. "
good,"Great to work with products you enjoy. Was hired in September and was never told I was considered a ""Seasonal Employee"". Found out I was seasonal when I reported to work, because I was on the schedule, and was unable to clock in. At this point I was told that I was let go."
good,Not big on writing reviews. But I guess they require it. Overall for a job I am working while I am in school the pay and benefits are not bad. But if you are someone who is looking to advance it is really hard to move up no matter how well you perform or how many roles you take on. Also for what we do for a fortune 500 company you will not gett paid good unless you move up.
good,We would have back to back appointments but not have the agents needed to take care of them and get other stuff done. Often other items got left behind for the next day.
good,"As a consultation agent at geek squad, I usually was scheduled 2-9 because everyone else was a ""family person"" it usually was slow. so a lot of standing around. You'll get in trouble for reading a book, but others don't for being on Reddit and blasting rap music. Is a silly place."
good,"It is a nice place to start working from home, but can be a hit stressful at times when it gets busy or the client is given incorrect information from the dispatcher"
good,"Best Buy is great to begin as a new/ first time job. Working for this company helps build character and most importantly to communicate with people. Also, very fun."
good,I worked for Best Buy for over two years.  I started on contract and worked my way on to full time.  The work was good and my co-workers where fun to be around.  Unfortunately the business took a downturn and I was given other duties I did not enjoy.
good,Best Buy is a fun place to work but is extremely competitive and sales driven. Too much emphasis on the numbers and not enough on the employees and the customers.
good,Very fast paced environment when working during the winter season. Boxing day is the day they train and work you up to. Then once the holiday season is over they drop many employees.
good,"Good place to learn and grow. Enjoyed working the warehouse,sales floor, and loss prevention.Raises were based on your performance but it took me almost three years to become a full time employee and the hours changed constantly."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time there. but Management did not have the proper oversight on employees which lead to conflict. other than that the technical aptitude of the PC department was unmatched.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"The company portrays itself to be a fun, flexible place to work, but is anything but.  All they care about is your numbers and what is best for them.  I only left this company about a month or so after I started my new job because they wanted me to conform to a ridiculous availability policy for part time employees that a full time employee would have a hard time consenting to.  I was only being scheduled 4 hours a week when I had to find a full time job and wanted to stay on with this company because I truly liked what I did there."
good,"While when I first started working at Best Buy, it was a great environment to work in, as I continued there, I found preferential treatment from managers negatively impacted promotions and those who didn't deserve promotions got them. Raises are a joke, they're based ""on performance"" but a 40 cent raise is considered great. Most of the managers are male, and make snide and often sexist/ homophobic jokes. It's definitely a very ""bro"" place to work. They pay better than a lot of retail does, but it's definitely not a living wage, and for what they expect the pay should be a lot higher. Promotions are possible but unlikely. They do offer benefits and a fair amount of PTO, if you're full time. The Microsoft Expert position is a burn out position though. Most people do something else after or before a year is up."
good,This was a great experience for be to be able to grow as both a customer service agent and a salesman. I appreciate the opportunity I had to interact in a serious corporate environment.
good,"Work hard, work fast. From the start to the end of day. We have not had a raise in years. everyone tries but is overloaded with work including management."
good,"Just like any other retail job, just selling mostly electronic's and protections plans to customers, most of the job was to help the customer find what they needed and possibly anything else that may improve the the life expectancy of the product or improve the product itself."
good,"consists of helping customers needs/wants. Finding out what they need and solving there problems quickly and efficiently. Management are fairly nice most days, but have there off days as well. The hardest part of the job has to be customers that aren't so friendly. Enjoyable aspects of this job are the benefits from working there such as discounts etc."
good,Worked at my own pace focusing on speed and accuracy. Using the Geek Squad provided tools I removed malicious content from incoming devices. This included providing excellent customer service for quests.
good,Help people find different products throughout the store. Answer general tech questions. Maintain clean and organized work area. Stocking products when needed.
good,It is a decent place to work. The discount is nice. the environment is cool for the most part. The only thing that i do not like about is the fact that my hours fluctuate too often and not in a good way.
good,This is a great company to work for if you are a tech-savvy individual looking expand your knowledge in the tech world. Very flexible time for the most part and extremely diverse organization!
good,"The Lakeland Best Buy has some of the best managers I've ever worked with, to this day it will be hard for me to find better. They're flexible and are willing to work with you in most scenarios."
good,"Working here is a great if you enjoy retail.  I can't think of any other retailer that has been as fun for me to work with.  It is always fun to be around new and exciting technology.  It is a challenge sometimes, which can be fun.  There is a high pressure to sell as well as get people to sign up for a credit card, but as far as retail is concerned, that is about par for the course."
good,"I had a great time working in the Oakdale Best Buy store.  Just wasn't able to parlay it into a corporate position despite a solid 3 years of effort.  Retail is tough sledding and wanted to get into something with more consistent hours, but the fall of the economy and retail in general in about 2007 marked the end of my electronics retail career."
good,"Good job, good pay, teaches you about warehouse and jobs in the retail. Learning about new technology and dealing with great customers. Overall not a bad company"
good,"I have an extensive background in sales, the environment of BBY is wonderful for those sales people who truly love sales. Insomuch as a whole the company is the best I have worked for, from CEO down. BBY is a very liberal and inclusive company that will give its employees the tools to succeed. My problem was with GM of this location and a sordid tale that I will spare you all of reading"
good,Great team environment.The best part of the job is the time spent with your co-workers and customers. Some times there are expectations that are set too high (more of a commission type of environment)
good,I've gotten an internship through them for a bit it was alright but they literally put me in the wrong position so it was kinda boring.
good,"Not too challenging or stimulating, good for experience. Not too sales oriented, just have to be there and talk to customers."
good,I like the people and the values of the company. However they focus way too much on selling services to help meet budget and i feel that since we don't work on commission they shouldn't be forcing us to work more harder to fulfill our tasks
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Good place to work. When I got hired on they asked for a two-year commitment. Went in under the impression that I was getting a full-time job then was handed a part-time job. If you're looking for a lot of hours as a part timer look somewhere else. if you love technology and love handling customers then this place is perfect. Management is very friendly and the people are fun to work with. Other than not getting very many hours this place is a perfect working environment.
good,"A good company to work for overall, work life balance varies by team.  The overall compensation is good if you come from outside the organization , once you are in the company it is hard to greatly increase your compensation package"
good,"Favorite thing about working there was the co-workers. The compensation was my least favorite thing about the job, after almost 4 years working there, there were some newer employees with less job duties that were getting more, the compensation was weak"
good,Helping people is great and the Job lets you see a new Tech as soon as it comes out. It was a very steady job. Work was never boring. New tasks to learn every day.
good,"Learned a lot of technology information, a place fun to work in because of the diverse amount of customers, management is very bad is the only negative thing about this organization."
good,Great company to work for overall. Has trouble managing through peak season and acknowledging and appreciating workers.
good,"Best Buy enhances team work among employees. I learned multiple things such as tax exempt registration, returns and exchanges, and web pick ups. My co workers and I have great communication and we all work together to achieve set goals."
good,Très belle entreprise qui nous permet de ce développer et d'apprendre énormément sur le service a la clientèle.
good,"Great starter job for IT professionals loved the type of customers you get to meet. Enjoyed the work experience, most positions are only part-time though. Wouldn't suggest to use it as your only job to have, unless you get a full time position."
good,Best Buy teaches you how to improve real sales goals. They don't send you out to work on the floor until you are educated about your work materials. Also they prepare you for future sales opportunities in any aspect by sending you off to a 3 day long sales induction class.
good,"Cool place, great employees. managment is a joke. and everyone is disoposable. the dress code was rediculous, as it litteraly went down to your socks. i also witnessed a few mass hires and mass fires of temps."
good,"Fun place to work with all of the diversity and technology. However, they can be disorganized and there's just not enough hours to go around."
good,I initially enjoyed my time at Best Buy. My manager and direct supervisor were easy to talk to and worked to make the in-store experience enjoyable for not only the customers but the employees as well. The store underwent a managerial restructure which forced those managers out and brought in an under qualified group. This led to the store's downfall.
good,"Each week I had to see what planograms I had to execute. The planograms were time sensitive, so I had to make sure they were completed when or before due date. I had to make sure I proved the work that I did and completed daily paper work."
good,"Not bad work... but held accountable for things that are by far outside of your realm of control (i.e. Service center work being completed incorrectly- and you being blamed for it.)"
good,Jobs has ups and downs you put more in than you will ever get out  management is not well trained hired with favoritism just a job not a career to lay ones hat down for life times where you would be talked to in rude manor and expected to take it or find another job bestbuy culture is different depending on store.
good,Worked great with customers and co workers. Management expects  unreasonable goal and doesn't normally follow up to feedback on their performance well.
good,"I worked for the company for 8 years in a multitude of roles.  I recently left my management position because the company simply is not the same.  Training is nonexistent and thus when a promotion comes open, there really isn't anybody to fill it effectively, so it really starts a vicious cycle.  Pay is good and management in stores really do care about employees, unfortunately there is very little support above that."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"•	Researched and developed the material for a series of four half-hour long video training series now used by company to train sales staff nationwide"
good,"Generally work shifts are organized 2 weeks in advance, and depend on all members of a departments availability, no notable shortage of hours. As long as goals are reached there is a high degree of flexibility within the position. Management is generally understanding of even the most trying circumstance that arises personally. Pleasant working environment."
good,"When I started with the company 8 years ago it was a growing, powerful company focused highly on employee satisfaction and promotion within. Now they have cut over 4,000 jobs in the last 2 years, and those are just the ones they have made official announcements about. The stores are so short-staffed that customers barely see associates, and associates are forced to run from one side of the building to the other constantly instead of learning and mastering a few key areas of products."
good,"I have worked for Best Buy for the past 3 years and have truly enjoyed it. This is a business that really ensures that you are aware of the new technologies that are available as well as takes the time to help you grow within the company. They adapt to the ever changing market of technology and stay ahead of the curve."""
good,"Great job to grow your communication skills. Company culture is amazing, everyone just wants to get along with each other to make work a fun environment."
good,this is a fun place to work and a good place to learn about all of their products. Working in a specific department versus being a cashier or in customer service is a lot more fun and less stressful. Interacting face to face with the customers is great and giving them advice on what they may need.
good,The company was not bad and the job was nice however the management was terrible. The managers never communicated with one annother and I would get caught in the crossfire when something went wrong.
good,"great place to work, fun while still being productive. Way too many managers to keep happy. the hourly sales goals are high and that can sometimes be a problem but it isn't always horrible"
good,"Best Buy is definitely the most fun place I've ever worked, but as a 27 year old man with a family, there's no advancement opportunities and I'm stuck with part-time college kids who have no work ethic. I've worked at 4 different stores, and this is the same story at all 4."
good,"Best Buy was a great company to work for while I was in college finishing my degree. It is a great way to get customer service experience. Yet, after a while it didn't seem like I was going anywhere. There is little initiative to move up in the company, unless that's your goal. It was a good company to work for they are extremely flexible to your schedule."
good,"I had fun working there. I did customer service and front lanes. A typical day was like 11 am work get a break like four hours in if there is someone to cover you. Lunch was the same way for about 45 minutes. Now if you closed the store you need to vacuum, clean and restock the store. Over all the place is nice my only negative thing I have to say is they are very short handed."
good,"The people that you experience at Best Buy can be a lot of fun, but if you're looking to advance or get even a decent pay to pay your bills, don't expect much. Unless you surpass all of your numbers personally, and beat everyone else in your department, you probably won't even be given a glance for a promotion or a raise. The management has more often than not sucked, with many power hungry people that are rude and inconsiderate and won't treat you any better than what comes out of a dog at the end of the day. The job is kind of laid back because it's only a retail job, but honestly, unless you're in high school and don't need to depend on a job for anything, don't go here."
good,"Very busy work days,witch made the job very suitable. Love interacting with guest and help them with all of their needs."
good,"I am currently at Best Buy, and it is a fun job, but the hours a bad and not many shifts. Its very fun but seems one sided. Learned more about inventory management and communication between co workers."
good,Best Buy is a very good place to work during  college.  A lot of friends were made and skills were gained.  Management wants you to grow inside and outside of the company.
good,"I worked for Best Buy for almost 5 years and it was an interesting few years.  I was able to grand open their location in South Loop and that was an amazing store.  When, I worked this location everyone was like family and got along well.  I would be sick as a dog, but because I loved my job, management and the team that I worked with I would still come to work.  They sent me home, but that is how dedicated I was about the job.  Later, I went on to grand open the Michigan Ave location.  For the first few months, things were great until management began to see that this location would be difficult and the reason being is that this location is frequented by international tourists.  International tourists are very difficult to sell protection plans to because they do not see the value in it especially when they may only travel to the U.S. once or twice a year.  Management for this location is great, but they refuse to see the difficulty in offering services to groups who don't believe in them and blame their employees for the low numbers instead of coming up with a solution such as bundle plans or a better presentation of the services.  The most enjoyable thing about working for this company is the ability to gain bonuses if the store hits a certain goal.  My co-workers were also an enjoyable part of the job as well.  The hardest part of the job is to work for a company where I had additional responsibilities such as register train all and new employees, being given key status in order to do overrides, put out registers in the morning and pull them in the evening to count them"
good,"Nice laid back environment until the weekends then its very fast pace."
good,"An average day at work would just be doing my starting routine of checking with management and going over emails. After if i have customers to help i will do that to troubleshoot and or solve and technical questions they have about their products (mainly computers) but other items as well as phones and sometimes gaming products. If there are not a lot of customers I help fix the computer that have been checked in for repairs. My IT skills have improved drastically working there because of my co-workers. Management was OK in the aspect some of them would rather talk then go manage or solve a customer problem. Co-workers was the best part they were all awesome and made working fun. Hardest part of my job was trying to multiple things at once with no help, this happened more than you would think."
good,This was a chance to help people find products that could help them to improve their lives. I helped make sure that these products were properly placed and priced.
good,"Best  Buy has been a great company to work for. They offer a number of benefits for both part and full timers. I have found that for the customers, as a company, they will fulfill their promises, but it's a different story altogether for employees. Having been with the company over a year, I've yet to be given an opportunity to move up despite good performances. The sales goals are often unrealistic, and the management cares more about your numbers then if there are even customers in the store. One of the employee values is to ""Have fun while being the best"" and I don't think they do much to make the job fun."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"In my experience there was no 'typical' day. So many things vary day to day which can be really fun!"
good,Its a great place to work if your in college. Simple tech issues for the most part. Very heavy sales demand by management takes away from the actual tech support and more about tech support service sales.
good,"The company has changed a lot over the past five years , the job opportunities have change diets so political verses being judge by your attributes."
good,Great place to start a career and get good work experience. Fun and fast palced work environment. Company offers good benefits.
good,"I helped with plan o grams, went on deliveries, worked loss prevention, unloaded trucks, scanned and priced items, cashier, and helped customers everyday. I learned how to manage employees and sit in on interviews and reviews. Most of the workers here were great, and others improved if a talk was needed for them. We all had long hours so helped each other make it work. Some of us got switched to an overnight shift that we didn't know about and I helped settle the issue with management. Constant bosses changing and favoritism was a huge negative for this company when I was here."
good,"Help out people returning unwanted items, picking up online orders, and recycling.I learned that working there can be really stressful and chaotic. Most of my co-workers were really nice, they always helped me when I was struggling with a costumer. The hardest part about the job was trying to figure out ways to help the different costumers that came into the store, since I was new I still had a lot to learn. The most enjoyable part about the job was that I got to move around a lot."
good,"Great company to work for but the management in the store is horrible. The company itself is wonderful. my typical day at work is come in, do a check in sheet, and if my department has customers, I'll begin to activate phone, if not I'll down stock."
good,"t was slow at times working for best buy but fun co workers were always nice friendly and helpful, I learned a new register and other job task. The hardest part of the job was just keeping up and making everyone happy. Enjoyable was seeing customers happy."
good,Amazing place to work. Sales team are more like friends than coworkers. Management are great people offering support and encouragement to exceed you current goals.Some high stress situations when things get busy but management usually keeps things flowing nicely.
good,"working on the sales floor with Best Buy will prove to be challenging for anyone who cannot multitask talking and listening to customers as well as writing down key points at the same time. Takes a little skill and patience to get better but just like anything else, practice makes perfect. This job also requires you to be aggressive with going after the sale and getting customers to purchase products NOW and not tomorrow. Think of it like selling based on commission...but without the commission."
good,"Great for people who like to take the ball and run with it.  Young culture.  High expectations from management.  No longer a ROWE working environment,"
good,Most of your co-workers are good honest hard working people.  Advancement is few and far between and usually goes to people who spend personal time outside of work with current management.  Hard to get on as full time majority of work is part time.
good,"Schedule was packed with long days, but they were manageable thanks to a group of very fun and light hearted co-workers."
good,It is a fun place to work. No balance for home life working nights and every weekend. Hours are all over never have they same days off or same time. Hard to make plans for family time.
good,"Working at Best Buy wasn't a particularly difficult job, and while the co-workers were all great, there was a lot of turn-over for management. The hardest part was constantly trying to convince people to buy a ""new"" phone which was pretty much the same thing as before with a new letter on it. I can't blame Best Buy for that."
good,"It is the place to be if you like call centers and fixing or helping others on their computers or other electronics through the phone. They do love to spoil their employees though. However, there is little to no job security."
good,I come across different scenarios at work each day. In my position as a manager I have learned to treat each one of these challenges as an isolated case and draw from prior experiences to come up with viable solutions based upon company policy. Finding solutions to new problems is the most fun part of my job. I enjoy assisting my peers as well as seeking input from them when certain situations do arise. I pride myself in making that extra effort to fulfill a client's needs end to end.
good,"Fun place to work and to learn new things. Always something to do. Get to work with some of the new product that Best Buy sells, fun coworkers to have. The hardest part of the job is the diagnosing, but at the same time its the most interesting part of the job."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Had a lot of shrink issues and made it difficult to satisfy the customers needs. Wanted full time hours at part time pay. Management never tried to fix anything until you went to hr with the problems or product request.
good,"-Provide outstanding customer service and cell phone sales consultation"
good,Working at Best Buy isn't horrible but it's not exactly the best either. I am expected to learn a lot about new technology but I feel as there is not enough incentive for me to actively pursue the level of knowledge they expect me to have without proper compensation.
good,"flexible with scheduling, stores very greatly by manager types. some potential for advancement. Overal all of 5/10 rating. many disgruntled employees at my location and constant change of leadership."
good,You learn really quick who you can trust and who will stab you in the back quicker than you can drop a dollar bill and pick it back up. It was like being back ion High School again.
good,"Good place to work; Would've liked to be their longer."
good,"Overall I've enjoyed working for Best Buy. Great management, and fun staff, however one thing I will say that drove me up the wall was the constant pressure to sell not only product but geek squad services and protection plans. Sales associates are asked to be ""sharks on the floor"" as if we are on commission... This was especially annoying during the Christmas season. I'm a college student and I need money of course, and for the amount of work expected for the same hourly wage as a mall kiosk, I'd say a person is better off working at a small store than at Best Buy. The discounts are pretty wicked though."
good,Diverse and energetic work environment. Fast paced retail sales and customer relations. Very enthusiastic managers with positive attitudes about the job and staff. Enjoyed coming to work everyday meeting new people and having a positive work environment.
good,Working at best buy was okay. It had it good days and bad days.but overall its a good place to work if you love computers.
good,"The coworkers were friendly and very nice, but the management picked their seasonal to part time workers unfairly. Other than that, I loved working there. It was fun and upbeat and I got fairly good hours/"
good,I loved working at best buy because I get to play with all the new technology learn about it. Then I get to suggest it to customers who are looking to add something new and fun into their life and daily routine and I get to teach them all about it. Great Discount too
good,"I have no review for Best Buy. The job is just what it is. The job description is very direct. Just like any other job, you'll end up doing more than you applied for, but only getting paid for what you applied for."
good,Fun people to work with but of course there is a lot of hoopla about numbers. It makes you sick after a while
good,"A typical day working at best buy involved processing inventory in the warehouse, moving it to the floor and ensuring that inventory levels were secure.  I learned many aspects of the inventory and customer service side of companies as well as the cost benefits of certain products.  "
good,Train people on apple products and applications. Track sales records. Make sure people are giving the best service possible!
good,Got to learn a lot about electronics and the co-workers were very nice
good,"Best buy used to be a very good place to work but its really changed the last 15 years. the amount of work people are expected to produced has increased greatly because of layoffs."
good,"since it is a live project , it requires 24 x 7 monitoring. We will have technical interactions with several other teams across the nation for this project . It is basically a US retail portal . The hardest part is there would be rotational shifts in work."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A Great company with Great views from senior management, however not from your direct management."
good,"Managing associates of taking care of potential costumers and making sure we keep the regulars coming back . Taking care of any unmet needs , displaying new technology, to customers for growth of the company. The hardest part of job was turning shoppers into buyers and selling the  benefits of service plans. The best part of the job was growing the company during 2002-2010 after that it wasn't a fun place to work anymore."
good,"Always on Time"
good,"Aprendí a manejar muchos equipos y paquetes computacionales, tanto a usarlos como a instalarlos, atender clientes y saber ofrecerles la mejor opción del producto que ellos buscan..."
good,"Great work environment lots of fun people, but sometimes management brought the whole place down."
good,great opportunity to work for a fortune 100 company.  A bit difficult environment for past few years due to massive reductions in workforce activities.
good,No matter what position you work at Best Buy you stay ahead of the curve on gadgets. On the other hand you do not have a great work life balance.
good,Everyday at work was a new and challenging.  I was given the opportunity to come in as a part-time associate and work my way up to manager.  I learned that the human side of the business is truly what makes it run.  Not the technology or the systems.  Its how those human elements line up and compliment one another do you maximise the full potential of your team.  Diversity was what made my job so interesting and having so much talent to work with day to day.  The hardest part of the job was obviously holidays when the work hours were long and the pressure to succeed was intense.
good,"good job, good pay, poor management, fun work environment. must know how to deal well with customers who have difficult issues"
good,Got to learn alot of different skills and meet alot of different people
good,"I was in charge and over saw the safety and security for a Best buy store. I would conduct anything from apprehending thieves, dealing and helping the surrounding Police Departments with investigations. I also was in charge of teaching new employees about asset protection, and I also ran a team of two other associates."
good,I worked there for only seasonal would have made it my full time job if they had an opening for full time but they didn't. would go back for seasonal again.
good,"In this job I learned what it meant to be a team player. We were judged as a whole in our particular area so it was up to each individual to support their coworkers to make the best of that particular shift. I felt that the management treated us fairly, but during holiday season, anyone found lacking in their job performance would be quickly replaced to ensure maximum efficiency. Most days at work were spent assisting customers with their various needs and keeping the store in the best presentable state. Hardest part of the job was meeting sometimes irate customer's demands. Most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,"Job security is there, but along with it, is little opportunity to advance."
good,I've learned the importance of keeping an area stocked and well maintained. The main theme for work was being a team player at all times. A typical day consisted of customer service and being aware of your metrics. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some co workers who didn't pull their end of the bargain so it ended up being more work for some of us. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people everyday.
good,Overall Best Buy was a good company to work for. I worked there for almost 12 years and learned a lot along the way. You're #1 focus is to ensure an outstanding customer experience. I loved the people I worked with. I was challenged often enough to keep me interested in the job. Fun atmosphere to work in.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting the customers what they need and making sure that there isn't anything stolen from the store. Working here I have learned how to multitask better and see what really matters to other people. The management here is in the process of changing, but from the beginning they have always showed us what it means to be a hard worker and show the best way to handle situations at hand. As the same with working with my co-workers, they are difficult some days but they have taught me how to work together even on the bad days. The hardest part about my job is working with the customers that could be making my job harder that day. Even with the hard customers I learn something new. This would be to look at their point of view and see where they are coming from. I have learned a lot from being here but I think that it is time for me to move forward and learn from another company."
good,"Great job, learned a lot with Customer Service and technology. Wireless Sales Consultant and also worked over Computers/Tablets"
good,"Great Place To work at, excellent staff and team member. Enjoy the discounts."
good,great development and experience for experienced managers.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy is a really fun place to work. You will meet some great people and learn some really cool stuff working there. It is great working with most customers finding them a solution for some really fun stuff. "
good,"I wanted to put thoughts out of a company I have been with for 3 years. I loved working and still am working for Best Buy Corp it has been a great learning experience through some great people. But, if your looking for a company that you can grow with you can do that to a certain degree but with caps in pay which are usually 12.09 per hour."
good,Always great to meet and work with new people and network. Lower level management is always there to provide guidance and motivation.
good,"I was able to use my sales skills and abilities to teach and train my sales people to perform at a high level.  We took 4 underperforming teams and with the same staff I was able to turn those teams into top performers."
good,"I worked many years in Best Buy and they have amazing programs for learning the product, great discount and great people."
good,"In charge of the back end of retail sales ( receiving, unloading trucks, stock counts, warehouse, deliveries, ext ). Work was fun and done in a timely manner due to a great team made up of 20 people."
good,"Best Buy Distribution Center, was a good place to work at. The work at best buy was easy and easy to learn. The Supervisor i was assigned to was a really good superviser, he really look after his employees. My co-workers were easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was probably walking on the waffle flooring on the 2nd,3rd and 4th floors.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting enjoyment when i finished doing an assignment."
good,Best Buy is a great company to work for.  There is room for advancement if you decide to stay in retail.
good,"I started out as a seasonal worker and left as a seasonal worker, but I enjoyed it for the most part. I got assigned to work the sales floor and try to sell laptops in that department, I did pretty well, and the employees there are very nice about teaching you ""the ropes"" The break room at my Best Buy had a an x-box and 2 flat screen tv's which was nice to watch when you were on your breaks. They are very good about sending you on your breaks! As a seasonal worker you have to be flexible with your schedule, Black Friday was very controlled and went very well. They provide free water bottles to employees which is a plus. They are good on lunch times as well. The hardest part of the job was trying to handle upset customers, but if you've ever worked retail you know that it really is about helping the customer out to the best of your knowledge or asking another co-worker for help. The most enjoyable part was learning all the cool things about electronics!"
good,"Typical day would be fixing hardware, software issues along with shipping and receiving laptops; desktops; printer; etc. Making sure employees was doing the correct work and dealing with customers. Learned how to manage a staff of 6 -12 people. Along with selling and being a team. Management knew what my capabilities was to keep Geek squad rising to the top. No problems in that area. Hardest part of job was helping employees that did not want to be helped(as far as work ethic). The most enjoyable part of this job they definitely make you feel at home like a family."
good,Good job to work. Only temporary christmas help. Sold appliances and had great co workers.
good,Not really a typical day at work every day brings different challenges. I learned to prioritize and engage with all employees. Management was not always on the same path. Co-workers were fun and supportive. Hardest part of the job was work/life balance. Most enjoyable part of the job learning new technology and interactions with customers and employees.
good,Gained valuable experience in customer service and sales.
good,Very concerned with sales. Employees do not make commission but every department had budget goals.
good,"It was easy enough to find other jobs in the company. There is not much else to say. The job was find some days other days, it made you hate your life."
good,"Developed all my skill set, lerned many strategies. Fun plce to work for."
good,"A typical day at worked consist of:"
good,"Constant interaction with customers, helping them find their solutions to their cellular phone inquiries.  Upgrading, adding a line, or starting new accounts with various cellular companies.  Day in and day out business entails powering up registers, counting expensives devices to keep an inventory track record, closing up shop at the end of the evening by cleaning up workplace.  Enjoyment and pleasure in communicating with customers and help guiding them to their proper resolutions.  compensation not always equal to expected production"
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Discount was great. Did not see many job advancement possibilities.  Over all colleagues were great to work with and managers were very understanding
good,Great company but the bestbuy I worked at no one moved up at all.
good,"I liked the atmosphere, the technology, the know how, the people, the customers were great but it is retail after all."
good,very fast pace. everyone was very nice. management really tried to apply the ideas the department staff came up with and apply it to the stores and new projects. lots of rewards for meeting goals. lots of cook outs/ food parties
good,worked in home theater so I learned a lot about the technology 
good,management was good. But HR was the worst. They treat people like numbers. 
good,"TECHNOLOGY & OPERATIONS LEADER"
good,"Best Buy Mobile is an excellent company to work for if you are just starting out in the career field. A typical day at work can include multiple activation's of various carrier accounts and dealing with numerous types of troubleshooting on devices. I've learned that if you sincerely enjoy what you do at work, you'll never have to work a day in your life again. My primary manager is a caring, driven and honest individual. He gets the job done for the sake of the business but does not neglect to make sure his employee's are doing well in their home lives. My co-workers that work under me feel the same way, we are all a family and we all stick together and build each other up in several different ways. Probably the hardest part of working in the retail field is dealing with the holiday hours, it tends to be very tiresome on all of us, but if you have a good team, that can make the time go by fast. I enjoy the people that I work with and the customers that I work with on a daily basis, I get great happiness from being able to turn a terrible phone situation (i.e, a customer losing all of their priceless information.) into a completely positive one . I am the employee that can typically turn a negative situation into a promising and positive one."
good,Great company to get experience in sales and develop business strategies. Hours were not great having to work weekends and holidays but had a great time non the less.
good,Good place to work especially for students and people that love electronics.
good,"My day at work would be routine based i would be making the schedule inputting time cards and leading the whole store. I was the Operations Senior, I also had the reponsibility of manager on duty and also had my own department to run as well. the enviroment of working at bestbuy was great i got to work with different people and learn new things as well. The hardest part of the job was when we dont have alot of tools to do our jobs. the most enjoyable would be we treated one another as family helped one another."
good,"Every single day you would have a supervisor that wasn't able to do his own job, so time to time you would have to step up and put hi wok load on your back."
good,I had fun in two years there and the discount is cool so i guess it was worth it
good,"The Geek Squad is a great starting place if you’re a recent college grad but it does not offer a lot of advancement. A typical day consists of setting up the store for business which includes stocking software, checking paper work, cleaning the work area, and making sure all machines are being repaired or the MRI is running correctly."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. worked hard learned a lot and used various equipment to get the job done. The co-workers were great once they realized that they were not losing their job to the new employees . Before that they were not so nice. Management was very helpful in making sure that we understood the job and do it to the best of our ability.
good,Hours were not the best. Management does not treat everyone the same.
good,A typical day at work includes selling computer and tablets to customers along with including solutions such as protection and tech support. I also had to talk about networking for home businesses.
good,Learning and playing with new technology while meeting all kinds of great people.
good,I loved working there but unlike my coworkers i am not 16 and live at home the pay that they offer is not competitve at all. I was in the top 20 in the district and I would have looked at a 13 cent raise and thats it
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Great place to work in especially if you going to school- very flexible with your schedule
good,"Of coarse fixing the issue is not always a simple task nor is the Client always satisfied which is one of the most difficult points of the job, It takes extreme patience and strong reliable resolutions to accommodate the client/customer needs and wants in a face to face fast paced environment. On the other hand the customers are the most rewarding, i enjoy helping others and help them understand the technology that makes today's world function. The leadership is something that needs to be reevaluated in my opinion, I have to admit going to the military at a very young age made me a Leader in everything I do no matter how small or large the job is, I don't feel like the management is 100% dedicated to the staff or company which lowers the overall morale."
good,"great place to work, people and staff are very friendly and if you can make a move into a management position the compensation and benefits are very good."
good,"I worked at Best Buy in Whitby, Ontario for almost five years. Over that course of time I started as a Home Theatre sales assossiate whos job was to sell TVs. I was promoted up to Business Professional whos job it was to attend chamber of commerce meetings, sell large scale packages to businesses, and to teach out product knowledge to part-time and full-time associates on the floor. Once this job was moved up to the corporate level at Best Buy, I was then giving the Senior role for the Digital Imaging department. My responsibilities included managing my own department, attending Senior meetings with the GM, preforming bi-monthly employee evaluations, and keeping pace with all the latest technologies and services Best Buy had to offer."
good,"A typical day at Best Buy for me is always making sure the customer comes first. Always making sure the customer gets what they need by upgrading their phones or getting them started with new accounts. Everyday this something new to learn with the way technology advances all the time. It is a great environment to work in, every one is extremely friendly and helpful."
good,"Hours aren't the greatest, especially during the holidays. Chances of moving up are extremely slim. Managers are not supportive."
good,Really great employee benefits like 401k employee stock plan discounts and health benefits.
good,"Great benefits, enjoyed working with all the other associates."
good,"We performed sales of computers, laptops and warrantys and services on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work involves instruction for customers with almost no level of tech knowledge. The job gives the ability to troubleshoot a variety of problems, most of which are caused by user error. Others are caused by registry errors or viruses. The hardest part of the job is the customer base being uneducated on the operation of computers and on computer hardware."
good,A typical day would include helping a a huge diversity of customers pin point particular devices and services to there needs. I enjoy meeting and engaging with new people.
good,"Fun place to work if you're a student, will make a lot of friends, pressured to sell warranties (no commission)."
good,"As a Home Theatre Specialist I found my self enriched with new challenges and task faced within the day. On a busy day, which was almost everyday I was faced with situations where I had to quickly resolve a customers problem by providing various solutions that would best fit the customers needs. I learned many new ways to problem solve, maintain emotion, and better perceive emotions made by customers. However the down side to this experience was the lack of an effective management and leadership role, which made the job more difficult. The individuals I worked with are very easy going and the work environment was stress free. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale to a customer and fulfilling their every need."
good,"It was a seasonal position, November to December 2011 but, I liked the atmosphere and the people I worked along side of."
good,As a startup position it was easy enough to operate there. Company was lacking technical support a that time.
good,Working at Best Buy in West LA was interesting since im very tech savvy. Its all hands on plus you get to communicate with the world in one big store.
good,Great management teams. lots of added perks such as on site day care.
good,"warehousing, set up of sales floor and signage. Sporadic hours of work"
good,"This job was seasonal, but I learned a lot about Best Buy. This job was due to the Christmas season."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,Best Buy is a good place to work in La Crosse. I think they offer a decent pay with okay benefits. Most of the employees are part time and they expected it to be life for them.
good,The management and regular employees are the best. Everyone has fun and enjoys their jobs. Advancement and job security was always difficult and in question.
good,"Best Buy is a good starter job for young adults or teenagers who are looking for a job to meet basic needs or wants. Unless you are a manager, supervisor, or LP, this job will not support a family and the hours are not consistent because it is retail. I appreciate the experience that I have learned while working for the Geek Squad, but at the end of the day, it is not a job I would like to make a career out of."
good,"You will meet great and creative people along the way, but as with any corporate environment it can create a tough place to move up or want to grow in. Experience you gain is invaluable."
good,"Good place to work, people are fun to work with.  Company seems to care about the people.  Willing to work with people on issues and help them move on with things."
good,"Not a very difficult job. Pretty laid back. Great job for college students, as the hours are flexible. Very fun and supportive work environment. You learn a lot of new skills working here."
good,"Great experience, learned so much. training on the job is great, it is very interactive. There is room for growth in the right situation. Hours are not great but thats retail."
good,Take the time to read about Best Buy and stop in at a store.The workplace culture is very good. People make the place and thus be all about customer service during any interview at Best Buy.
good,"Good place to work and great employee discount"
good,I worked for a separate company inside of Best Buy. I had the opportunity to work among best buy employees and learn more about their work culture and experiences.
good,Great company to work for. Only downside is that with it being such a large company it can be hard to feel appreciated sometimes. Nice discount and 401k matching.
good,"Of all of the retail establishments I have worked for, Best Buy was by far the most fun to work for.  They also had the best training paths available for advancement."
good,Working at Best Buy is a great opportunity for those looking to gain more experience in a fast paced working environment. You can also learn a lot about sales.
good,"amazing leaders and great people. Fun environment, supporting staff. Big family. "
good,"Get settled, clock in, and get ready for the daily appoinments. Ensure all equipment is fully functional before the day begins."
good,It was a great experience. I learned alot about customer service. Leaving customers satisfied was a big goal for me and I was dedicated to my task everytime I was there.
good,I believe that Best Buy was a great work environment for me and my fellow co-workers. We all got along with each other and helped each other when we needed it.
good,Best Buy is a good place to work for. Good Coworkers. Good managers. All around a good company to work for. Helping out the guest and seeing them happy when they leave it makes you feel good.
good,I enjoyed Best Buy they were helpful and willing to move you around within if you felt you wanted to work in other departments. Very nice environment and people.
good,Great culture and inspiring leadership!  Company has risen from risks of bankruptcy to highly performing organization with strong values and even stronger business outcomes.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"I was a front end customer service employee. I really liked everyone I worked with and if I didn't know the answer, someone was always willing to help me out. A lot of the times customers would get upset because best buys return policy is only 15 days and they would ask to speak to a manager and about 95% of the time the managers had your back and would reiterate what you had already said to the customer which I really appreciated. They always had cake for birthdays and would randomly have food for everyone and company wide sporting events and things like that. "
good,"•	Loaded and unloaded inventory and determined the correct location for items"
good,"Most managers are driven for looking at Best Buy credit cards and memberships, some managers care more about individual growth. Most managers are flexible and understanding"
good,Good job if you wanna make a lot of money with no time to spend it and have the patience to deal with a chaotic upper management. One plus was there was always different depts to fall in to.
good,Flexibility with scheduling and great work culture but no room for movement up in IT. Benefits are really great but the pay isn't enough for the position.
good,"The day to day work was not difficult and was about the same when I did sales. when I was apart of their remodel team anything could happen. There was no issues with the management, they always wanted to make sure you did your best. The best part of my job was all the people I was about to work for and the worst part of my job was not always having the same staff day to day."
good,"I have been working at best buy for about a month and a half and most people are very nice, the only problem is that I have been there that long and I really had to learn everything by asking because no one was really willing to show you how or why something is done the way it is."
good,A typical day at work is helping the customer and giving them good customer service. There is never really a hard time at work because everybody is always ready to help.
good,Competitive selling but mostly trying to find the customer a solution. The employees are amazing and management want you to succeed. Some rough patches with customer fluctuation but overall good.
good,"Best Buy is a really nice place to work however customers expect you to know everything and every detail on every product. Its a lot to know for a little compensation. "
good,"Best Buy was a good job to work for. They have flexibility for school hours, people with kids, etc. management was very respectful of their employees."
good,They don't take the time to listen to their employees. Its been OK to work there overall like every other job it has its ups and down. The pay is not what is use to be and benefits become higher every year.
good,"Overall, my experience at Best Buy was enjoyable. I got to interact with many types of customers and help during the busy holiday season. Everyone had their own department and tasks to complete within them."
good,They are always having people doing busy work and challenging their employees to new things. Great to their employees and I really enjoyed it. Very good job to have
good,Not great but okay. Management was not the best. They were more focused on pushing sales than the actual customer needs. The people were great and it was an exciting job.
good,"it was a great place to work and the overall experience was great, made some lifelong friends and memories that i wouldnt change for the world.  hope this helps."
good,"When management actively engages and prepares you to be the best you can be and actively supports you in learning and advancing, it's fantastic. However, there are some stores out there where the managers truly just care about themselves and their bonuses and it shows in employee performance and atmosphere"
good,You trade a lot of personal time to please customers and demanding bosses.  Every year you have to work harder and harder with little to no advancement after General Manager.
good,"It's alright, have to be willing to learn about products and talk with customers to find out what they may need. Best buy does provide learnings on many things."
good,It has its ups and downs. Pay depends on area and job. Some jobs deserve more than  given. But benefits are very good for what  they are and hours very flexible.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"Best Buy was a fun place to work. They had great discounts for employees, plus incentives, and certificates. Everyone there was friendly and got along pretty well. Nobody stole as an employee which depends on your management really. The wage at Best Buy was actually better than their competitors. Since I've worked there they did raise the pay too so now the Sales Team is making minimum $14 an hour. They used to buy free food all the time and they would put on events like ""Game Night"". Best Buy felt like a family."
good,"The job pays well and fun. Job duty alot of walking, undercover duties observing customers and employees.Ensure all products have been received properly in the computer system so that delivery can be scheduled with the builders/customers."
good,Fun place to work for and they have a good variety of electronics. The management was very helpful and made sure the people who worked there had what they need.
good,"I liked working for the company, traveled for work but the only down turn was the working over nights. Most coworkers made you feel like family and was very tight."
good,"It's retail. It is a great place for a kid in college or fresh out of high school that would need tuition assistance and utilize all the benefits Best Buy does offer. I find Best Buy to be a stepping stone in the workforce. Best Buy allows you to learn your strengths and weaknesses and assists in improving those traits. The hardest part of the job, is inventory time. Every year each store has to do its inventory count and there are thousands of sku's inside one store. Other than that, the job is great. The pay could be better if you are a more seasoned employee."
good,Empresa con una gran cultura y una oportunidad de crecer
good,Best Buy provided me with the opportunity to grow within building my sales skills and customer service in a face-to-face sales role. It was definitely a stepping stone for me to pursue a path in technology sales.
good,Management and the rest of the team felt like family. I had a great time working there. The only thing that I really wanted was a bit more hands on and interactivity.
good,The culture at Best Buy is one of the things I think sets the job apart from others everybody is like family to each other. The company seems to care about its employees.
good,"Gain skills, better for younger generation under 30"
good,Los valores y misión de la empresa son lo que hacen que sea una empresa tan exitosa.
good,"Nice place to work, good management team, opportunities to grow in the company, good employee discounts, great benefits for full time employees, can relocate to various locations"
good,"environnement de travil superbe, employé respectueux, amical"
good,"Working there is more of a sales focused instead of a culture focused, even though we didn't get paid on commission. The hardest part of the job was to sell those credit cards and the management team would always be on you if you didn't sell any."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping customers with their problems and also pitching warranty to customers"
good,"Engaging with customers is a lot of fun and there is a culture of learning and growth that is very encouraging to be a part of. However, there is also a strong emphasis on meeting your sales goals. So much so that it can ruin the entire experience. The company also only promotes based on performance, so the guys that want to make more money will often use cut-throat tactics to rise to the top, and the company rewards that behavior. I was the second best salesman in my department nearly every month for almost two years. Every time advancement came up, I was passed up by the person who was #1 at the time."
good,Had a great time working with customers figuring out what computer and/or computer parts they needed. Providing them with what they needed and having them leave satisfied was the best part.
good,"Good place to work when you have an awesome manager or supervisor that doesn’t place themselves in the bossy position of their employees but place themselves with their employees, good people and work environment."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The interview went well was very well conducted with both the first and second interview. The first was very informative and the second was straight forward about what I’ll be doing
good,"they give you room to gow and better yourself. fun place to work.     "
good,Work depends on time of year and has a great moral between employees. Wirk was fast paced but not to hard. At first though you were thrown in at a sink or swim situation.
good,"Part-time position: Really enjoyed working for the leadership team, my peers, customers, and environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was making our customer happy and working together as a team."
good,"When I came into Best Buy, I was young and fresh on the job market. I was lucky enough to get thrown into one of the top stores in the company, with many of our associates and managers winning a trip to San Diego for our performance. After about 8 months, our GM, Assistant Manager, Home Sales Manager, and Computers manager (now positions that probably don't even exist) were at different stores leading new teams. That is awesome for the company, but for our store, it was shaky at first. Our culture dipped from top notch to pretty cool."
good,"Working at the Goleta location was very enjoyable, with management who wanted to help us grow and succeed. Unfortunately when I transferred to the Fresno location, it seemed to be more about politics and fear of getting fired."
good,"the food was really good and everyone took their breaks together so it was nice to visit with friends and staff, they offered a lot of different machine training which could help advance you."
good,The company was fast paced and promotes a great culture. The people I worked with were very helpful and ensured excellent customer satisfaction. I highly recommend it.
good,"In retail, a large part of the store's overall performance depends completely on the work of the managers to make it a great experience. I made close bonds with all my coworkers and they helped make the days go by a lot easier."
good,"My time with BestBuy has helped develop my team building and interaction with people on a vulnerable level, while providing clients with confidence and insuring their devices are in safe hands."
good,I love my job. I Learned a lot from there. The management and the employees were fun to be around. And helping customers was one of the things that I love the most
good,Great place to work and fun and friendly  environment. Best buy as a company is a great company leading in most technology sales companies. I have to say it's a great place to work.
good,They stress about sales and getting people to sign up for their credit cards and getting the geek squad the management has changed since i have worked their
good,The store you work at can heavily impact your career at Best Buy. You can have great leaders and team members but might not reach revenue goals. You may also not get all the hours you want depending on your schedule.
good,"I got to work with alot of cool people, cool management team, and cool hours. i got to learn how to drive multiple forklifts and also lean how to use the bof system (scan gun) ."
good,Great but stressful work environment. A lot of training and comradery around other co-workers. Sell goals are high but achievable. Environment is stressful and approachable.
good,The workplace culture was enjoyable. There’s definitely room for growth if you want to stay within the company. The pay was decent and management took care of employees
good,"Best Buy was a great way to start out my work experience. You learn how to efficiently and proficiently become a salesperson and it really makes you get out of your comfort zone. The cool thing was that you continued to grow each day that you worked regardless of a slow day or not. The biggest downfalls of Best Buy I experienced after working there for 4 years was that the job turnover rate was awful, inconsistency in the managers between store and district, favoritism was very real, and the politics involved in trying to move up in the company was off-putting and very discouraging.  Overall, decent pay starting out, great benefits, and great sales and business learning experience."
good,The discounts are amazing.  Home theater is more fun and less stressful.  Appliances is probably the most relaxed.  Mobile is definitely the most stressful
good,"I loved the people I worked with, good work environment. Being around technology was very cool and I usually had a good time at work but my store was very low traffic so there would be a lot of downtime."
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"good place to work , its a school for those who want to learn technology and costumer service, very little  opportunities to grow due to favoritism, very poorly positive fee back but very highly negative fee back which it feel most of employees loss their passion to perform at their highest level."
good,"Treats you like commissioned sales without the pay of commissioned sales. Sales training was good, product training was lacking. E-learnings are not sufficient to actually teach you about a large variety of products. Management could be either super chill or super fickle and clique-y. The press for sales is less ""do good and you will be rewarded"" and more ""do poorly and you will be punished"". The first store I was at was decent and the second (Power RD) had good/tolerable employees and bad management. Several people were fired or quit from my position over the course of a year. The work wasn't too difficult in some areas of the store but it varied. The employee discount is really good."
good,"Based on my position and qualifications I was put into a position where I had a lot of freedom but also had no relief when I needed a restroom break. I never got a break or lunch because the only relief that could be provided to me was from management. This did not seem to be the case if you were on the sales floor but working in customer-facing operations made this very difficult. I do believe my experience was a rather particular one based on my position but it was disconcerting. I was also forced to work with pneumonia and bronchitis without the option of excused leave."
good,"I worked at Best Buy in my early twenties and I can honestly say it was the most fun job I have ever had. Because there were very few full time positions in the store, I would not recommend it as a good place for a career."
good,"Fun to workplace to work for a college student, needing some money for college. also got to interact with a lot of new people and also got to learn many new things"
good,"Overall, it was a fun experience that exposed me to management logistic and product management in a warehouse setting. Since the work was in the back end of the store managers allowed for a free environment."
good,Best Buy was a fine place to work. I had good coworkers and enjoyed going to work. Not entirely sure why this is a required part of registering with Indeed but here it is.
good,The position I had no longer exists. It was an easy going job with a lot of freedom as long as your tasks were completed. My coworkers were very committed and made the day go by fast.
good,"The ""company"" is great... The local store is questionable! There's alot of favoritism, and alot of judgement. If you're not in a click you're just a peon!!"
good,"Working for Best Buy is great. It’s a good company with many different benefits such as employee hotline, 401K, child care, etc. They don’t discriminate against anyone. The management is very understanding and will make your schedule flexible to your needs."
good,It's retail. I'm not sure what else to say. I'm writing this to get another retail job. Above average employees and managers. I'm still writing words.
good,"I overall have enjoyed my time at bestbuy however the current general manager of the Bestbuy in Everett is pushy, ill-tempered and unorganized. The company values have also changed to the point where I no longer agree with its vision of the future."
good,"I worked as a high school student part time, and i always went to work looking forward to seeing my fellow employees and helping customers in need. I always left work with a smile."
good,Any company could fire there associates for what they say about the company. I shouldn't be required to write a review of somewhere i currently work..
good,"The team there is fairly new, so trying to get everybody on board with working together and taking extra work has been difficult. The management team is also new, and not very kind when there are a lot of issues going on at once. There are only two people I can actually go to when I need something taken care of, or an employee needs a talking to."
good,Best Buy was a great place to learn and enhance customer service skills. Its a very friendly environment making it very easy to learn and improve yourself.
good,"Great entry position for getting into sales and service. Your experience may differ on the store culture and managers on duty. Personally experienced a good working environment, but training left a bit to be desired. Otherwise, be curious if you are serious about involving yourself-- no one will go out of their way to teach you!"
good,it was a great environment with great people and amazing products.i loved coming in everyday and showing up to be with my fellow co-workers and being able to provide a service for my community.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,The hours were good at Best Buy until they started to change their scheduling. Pay was good until the scheduling was changed. Only left for this reason.
good,"Great step on the ladder"
good,I enjoy working at Best Buy because of the co-workers.  I only work there part time and I am searching for a Full Time Job with good salary and benefits.
good,Fun to work with fellow employees but overall the advancement needs help. Managers don't train you for future rolls and the pay scale is not based on individual or even department success
good,Best Buy is a good company. Although there is some issues within coworkers gossiping and the amotsphere can use some growth and better personal branding.
good,"A typical day at work involved making anywhere from 1-5 service appointments based on length of project. Professionally installed A/V equipment, networking/WiFi devices and educated clients on use of equipment as well as maintenance."
good,"It was a fairly quick paced, very competitive, and never much down time. Enjoyable to work there. The benefits were rather basic, and there was biweekly pay."
good,Productive work environment. Opportunities to grow within the company. Friendly staff and management. Great atmosphere. Provided an understanding and open minded approach on personal matters.
good,"Friendly, challenging environment that taught me stress management patience & how to keep busy. The customer traffic on holidays was the hardest part & the most enjoyable was the friendly energy from fellow employees."
good,"Una gran empresa, destaca por su gran apoyo hacia la gente nueva, las personas de las distintas áreas siempre muy amables."
good,"Overall it is fun place to work with nice team work. Also adapting quick changes in market. "
good,"Depending on your job, how much money you make and how long you stay hired is up to you. Management was a little flaky but team members and co-workers made the place a fun environment"
good,"A job with the Geek Squad, regardless of position, means coming into a fold of people interested and dedicated to troubleshooting and repairing the devices that ensure day to day life continues uninterrupted. I know that might not sound super exciting but there are tons of positions within Geek Squad to advance into, especially if you're willing to relocate, and not once while working there did I ever feel that I could not learn something new from every interaction or that the job was more trouble than it was worth. Without being exact the pay isn't bad for the work you preform. You will see both machines and people from all walks of life. You'll learn how to manage a work environment and handle expectations, as well as learn to document all work preformed. And overall, you'll have a great time among like-minded people looking to grow in a career field that has endless potential. It is more than worth the application and time it takes to send a resume their way."
good,The company was good but I don’t have anything really to say about it I have moved on into another job the company was fun to work with while it lasted there is room for opportunity to grow there if you want to move up.
good,Some managers were better than others. Some managers played favorites. No room for advancement even with a degree. It's who you know. Disappoint but the employees were a blast to work with. Had long lasting friendships after I left
good,I am sti new..39 days in.  They take training serious.  You have to do a lot of elearnings before you can even hit the floor.  Being in the Geek Squad requires even more training and testing....even though you may know what you are doing. Other than that it has been a very good collaborative environment.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"a good place to work at, if you are looking for a flexible and fun place to work at, Bestbuy is a place were you get tracked for sales yet you get no commission for it, it get frustrating when you get pushed to sell everything with no benefits."
good,"Good introductory job, but little feeling of self accomplishment. They sweat up and down you aren't commission paid, but put huge emphasis on commission goals for bonuses."
good,I was at customer service desk so I was working with returns and exchanges. It taught me to be understanding and how to make sure that people who come in angry leave happy.
good,"Although the company does not work on commission it is extremely rare to receive praise for a job well done as opposed to always being shown what could have been done better.  I am in no way a complacent individual and feel constant development and growth is essential not only in the work place but in life; however, like many other retailers it can weigh on you over time.  They are one of the best around as far as PTO/benefits for their employees and I can honestly say it seems the majority of the company cares about their employees."
good,"Best Buy was great, just was a part time employee looking for hours. Best buy was one big family, great managers and etc. Best Buy taught me a lot such as time management."
good,"When I started working at bestbuy, I was greeted with respect, they taught me how to do my job and if I didn't do well they moved me somewhere where I was doing well,"
good,good Retail experience. Know  your product and help assist when you can. Helping with inventory and going above and beyond for customers. You can get discounts of latest tech and gadgets.
good,"sales floor: work like on commission but not paid commission, credit card apps goals, protection plan goals."
good,I worked in Best Buy Mobile for most of my time at Best Buy. I learned about time management skills and responsibility. I enjoyed the workplace culture.
good,after they started to down size and hire people for less to do more.  I was there for 8 years before i was let go or my position was eliminated.  i wasn't able to get back at a lower pay.
good,"I loved my job, loved my customers and loved my employees. What I did not live was the good ole boy system as far as advancement goes. It’s truly who you know not what you know at BBY. The DM was friends with all the managers and never believed how bad some of the GM’s were to their employees and how the support staff usually ran the store! Either they did not care or knew and never did anything to correct it. HR is never on your side and everyone is reviewed on things they can not control like turn over rate. That is the GM’s responsibility and they have it on all the Sup’s yearly review. What a joke! I loved the company for the most part!"
good,"A typical day included sales to customers on a a one on one basis as well as learning new products and keeping the sales floor tidy."
good,"Although no commission is given, you are tracked for sales. Still a fun environment, discounts are very good. Training is minimal, everything you sort of pick up on yourself."
good,"great place to work you get to meet new people learn new things. but can be stressful depending on the department, and they do not like to promote 18-21 year olds management positions even if you know everything."
good,"Best Buy was a great job, surrounded by great people with tons of knowledge about their products. The managers helped set realistic goals and also developed genuine relationships with their employees."
good,"The company of BBY is amazing, but depending on your management team can go downhill very quickly. This management team was terrible. If didn't hang out with them outside of work then they didn't like you and they made your work life has hard for you as possible. Whereas their friends were able to do whatever they wanted to do. The GM is a great man, but when the rest of his leadership team doesn't care it doesn't work."
good,"Days are fast paced and can be long. But overall having fun and being challenged everyday made it worth it. Can be a struggle given the weather, be it extremely hot or cold in the warehouse."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reaching store and personal sales goals while maintaining customer relations. I learned quite a bit about the sales environment, risk and asset protection, customer care, and goal setting. The management was quite intense, however, and felt as if it was in the interest of themselves rather than the employees. Workplace culture was extremely competitive and incentives were given to sell products. The hardest part of the job was meeting the goals set by management to keep the store over revenue goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team and having the ability to help a customer or client on a daily basis."
good,Great place to work and advance in for those looking for a place to work their way up into a more long term career. Enjoyed the team I worked with there.
good,Great place to work but I need to move to Full time and in my position there isn't many opportunities for that.The people you work with are very friendly and helpful. Compensation for your work is really nice as well.
good,Working at best buy you not only meet a vast majority of individuals but you also make some friends along the way and you become knowledgeable about things you've never even thought of just by being there.
good,"A day at Best Buy consist of attending customers and providing great service while still managing to be at a certain pace. You want to meet your goals as it will help you gain more hours but you don't have to worry too much about not meeting those goals as the managers really do try to help you with coaching and such. They are also very understanding and friendly, it's not a drag going to work and is actually kind of fun. Moving up has not been difficult for some individuals. One thing I can say needs to be improved is being able to balance the size of the team with the amount of hours available, sometimes shifts for part timers can be as low as 1-2 a week."
good,"Work place was great, and they have an amazing list of benefits. The big thing is management. If you have a good set of managers, then it will be an amazing experience, but if you don't, it will not be the best time."
good,It was a team oriented culture that offered a lot of room for advancement. A big part of the job is just teaching customers about new technology and showing them how it works.
good,nice people learn alot about new products. did not like black friday. the crew is awsome. spent a lot of late nights working inventory. had to leave due to better paying job
good,Loved working there had a blast they teach you all that you need to know to be top of your game wonderful discount top of the line technology mice work space
good,"Communicating with people is what I have beeen doing for the past 20 years.I give my 100% every time,every day you learn something new.I love communicating and educating people around me.I always come in to work with a positive attitude.And I always try to enjoy the time I spend with my associates."
good,The company is very friendly and pays attention to the employees. Some days might be hard but everything is usually really good. I like learning a lot and there's a lot to learn in the company so I feel great working here.
good,"Working at Best Buy wasn't so bad on a day to day basis. I guess things would've been better if there wasn't such a ""we have to do better"" environment."
good,"Typical day at work was to come in and clock in. Put on uniform in the back and come prepared to help customers with questions and sales. Learned when to let upper management take charge of a situation, how to interact with colleagues, and communicate well with others on time management. Hardest part of the job was the expectations upper management had without mentoring a specified scenario. Coming in and working hard."
good,"I worked for Best Buy during the 2017 fall / 2018 spring as a seasonal warehouse employee. The training was done via computer but gives enough background to the tools and role that it is very easy to understand how to effectively do the job. The environment changes day-to-day, with some days being quick-paced and non-stop, while others were extremely relaxed. The management was mixed, but for the most part, were always there and able to help when needed. The co-workers were incredible, being extremely inclusive to everyone, making the standard day at work fun and interesting."
good,Very nice place to work my co workers were okay to work with beside management making me quit I thought it was a great place to work would work there again under the new manager.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Best Buy in the Customer Service, Computer, Appliance, and Mobile departments. Best Buy gave me opportunities to use the skills I've learned on previous jobs to showcase my leadership skills and also taught me new ways to approach customers."
good,"Bestbuy is an amazing company to work for .Its a ton  of room to grow within the company , and they give you a lot of experience and knowledge you can take with you any where in life"
good,"Usually you'll find yourself part of a family, everyone tends to be nice and helpful especially to newbies. I have worked at best buy for 3 years and I wish they paid more accordingly especially if they are strongly reliant on you."
good,Enjoyed it for the most part however I would say that the culture left a little to be desired. The amount of times I was encouraged to lie to my customers to get them to buy services was ludicrous but otherwise enjoyed the experience and want it to improve before it crumbles from the pressures of Amazon and Walmart.
good,Best buy was a overall great place to work for all ages in fact we had a diverse age working there when i was working there (16 to 68). I felt a part of the team at best buy with a leadership full of knowledge and genuine int interest in the betterment of the team and employees.
good,Learned a lot in a fast pace retail environment. Training was very good and often managers care to make sure you are a subject matter expert so you can efficiently sell their core products and services.
good,"While experiences at Geek Squad / Best Buy are largely linked to the state of each store, Geek Squad offers great early career opportunities for people fresh out of high school or working their way through college. Under effective management and leadership, workers that move into the repair technician roles at stores can find themselves working flexible shifts, competitive wages against other retail companies, and many learning opportunities."
good,"I've worked at two stores. First one had great managers. At the second store there were some good managers but the other ones were not very good. They give you great options for benefits, but as said before depending on the store and managers, you might not get that much of a pay raise in your annual review."
good,I enjoyed my time with Best Buy.  It was a nice learning experience before heading into the world of IT.  It kept me in tune with the new networking products out in the work place and home.
