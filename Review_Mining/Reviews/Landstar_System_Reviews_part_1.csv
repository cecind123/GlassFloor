rating,review
bad,"We received a message that our agency has been terminated, they took off emails, and the system access while we were having 10 loads to move and 7 in transit. They don't give a thing whether you try to serve your customers well or not. Company has owed us $5 000 and don't pay carriers we have hauled loads with."
bad,I liked it t first then they open up overtime and I used to work about 120 hours every two weeks.The would get ride of you if they fill like your making to much money and the director wanted my old supervisor to go into all of my accounts and delete my notes which is falsifying.
bad,Toxic environment.  Supervisors unprofessional.  Harassed and intimidated some employees.  This particular company was like a revolving door.  Many employees lasted one week or less.  Pay was very poor.  Compensation and benefits are poor.
bad,"You train yourself & for yourself. Having to learn from your mistakes or just figure it all out on your own. On stressful situations, management cannot work under stress & disrespect employees with negative thoughts, words & feedback."
bad,They didn't care if I ran out of fuel or not. They only load a little bit of money daily for fuel on your card. You sit at truck stops days at a time waiting on a load. You have to.pay for a percentage of the fuel you burn as well.
bad,"Welcome to LSTR, here you are under paid, over worked and not appreciated BUT at least you have a job!!"
bad,You can buy a truck and lease it to Landstar if you want to but be warned: They are hiring WAY TOO MANY trucks! Their agents are about half shady salesman types and the other half are just plain dishonest. Getting the good work requires that you own a small fleet of at least 6 to 8 trucks because all the high paying freight goes to them. Its a swindle from start to finish.
bad,There is nothing the matter with Landstar.  It is just another fortune 1000 company that is bloated with tenured employees and has no room for a new employee to grow.
bad,"If you’re looking for high turnover just join IA at Landstar. Not only do they have just two auditors for that large of a company but they don’t pay enough for the absolute archaic ways they decide to audit. Additionally, they will never agree with what you write even though you know full well how to write better than they do. The operational audits are a bunch of fluff, and you will think you have a new career as a professional writer without your work truly ever being published, just nitpicked to death. SOX audits are required in between and you can never miss a deadline because God forbid the Board of Directors ever finds out. If you are coming from a streamlined organization you will not find that within IA. Why the CEO and CFO continue to allow this department to operate on a dysfunctional level is beyond comprehension."
bad,"This company American Frieght services by Landstar is nothing short of a scam.  First off, We wasted the first week and another agent gave us the MC number we needed to even start approaching shippers.  Every shipper I called said that they would no longer deal with landstar.  They say that Landstar is double brokering.  By the second week, only 4 people remained.  The broker changed the game and said that no we only have to worry about getting loads, well word quickly spreads and with the landstar name you won't even be able to get the first load.  After that, you still won't be able to get a driver for your load as was my case.  The shippers are low balling LANDSTAR agents and the drivers are HIGH PITCHING, so that you won't make anything.  The drivers always have an excuse as to why they cannot take your load and the BCO's are the worst.  Its a company on its last legs.  The industry has changed for the worst and Landstar has been BLACK BALLED, but now instead of them scamming the shippers, they are now scamming their own AGENTS!  run run run away and don't waste anymore than a day in their class.  If you have a job, don't leave it for this!!!  That's what they encourage you to do.  Because they KNOW its a scam and your screwing yourself over.  Don't do it.   You'll be very sorry you did!  Oh and he sent us an email at the end threatening us that if we don't show up for training tommorow morning at 8, that we will NEVER BE ABLE TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY AGAIN... I'm gonna forward this email to EVERYONE so that they can see what kind of people Landstar has.  THEY MAKE YOU MARK"
bad,"Micromanaging, too much politics, no recognition for hard work, you have to be buddy with Vice Presidents or Directors to advance. They do not like nor support diversity. Unhealthy work environment and company."
bad,"Cut throat business, no real way to make money. Brokers took all extras. Brokers would try to change loads, place lower than advertised RPM and no tarp fees. Had to fight for the loads between all other drivers."
bad,Landstar is like a franchise. It's a freight brokering company. I did not like my manager and he made the workplace very stressful and hard to work in for everyone. He should not have been a manager but he was also the owner of this franchise that I worked at.
bad,"1st hour - code"
bad,Owner/Operator based company. Owner/Operators conduct business through a network of agents overseen by Landstar. Loads are displayed on an internal load board.
bad,"Over work"
bad,"The position as a data/entry imaging clerk..is awful..they have you working on these old dated scanners and expect miracles."
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for. If you are into forgery, lying, cheating & stealing from clients & employees then this is the place for you. I would NEVER recommend anyone to Work for Little John Transportation, Inc (LJTSI), a Landstar Agency. It will destroy you from the inside out..."
bad,"automotive management were the stupidest people on the planet..slept their way to their positions. Director sleeping with the vice president of the automotive department. HR aware of the entire situation, and does nothing. Ridiculous."
bad,"I did not enjoy being middle man, searching for freight and then convincing drivers to take it for much less just to make a buck on their driving."
bad,"Need better training, Was hard to get started with companies."
bad,"The guys in shepherd, mi are a joke. This is definately one job I wish I could go back and not take. Everything from training to day to day interactions was overall a horrible experience."
bad,They gang up on any one they target. They put a tremendous amount of time and effort in finding your mistakes and sharing with every one but you. Management is passive aggressive on a personal level. Rules are adjusted according to whom they are dealing with. Not a healthy environment/no work home balance.
bad,I worked at Landstar for 5 years.  I felt they played favoritism with employees who had been there a long time even though they spent their time online shopping or surfing.  They treat everyone differently and not equally.  Discrimination at its best.
bad,"This review comes from a contracted carrier so it is n/a to office employees. Landstar, like most other contract carriers treats every driver the same - you're an idiot until you prove otherwise, and even then you're still an idiot That's why I decided to start my own DOT Operating Authority. "
bad,Did alot of work. Was always busy. Employees around you are nice. Management on the other hand a different story.   They are very rude and don't care about if you are even stressed. They except you do work your butt off.
bad,Watch what you sign. You cannot trust the independent agents who work for the corporation of Landstar. Landstar does not hold themselves responsible for what their independent agents due in regards to employee's
bad,Thankful for the knowledge and experience. Hard to learn alot on my own or to call old employees for assistance. Boss had her picks on who she wanted to assist. But overall it was a great learning experience.
bad,"The supervisor expected me to know everything in a week, he grew frustrated & fired me after 6 weeks....he was rude & glad I got unemployment off of them."
bad,"Just an all around awful place to work.  Liability Claims in Risk Management is ran so terribly. Good coworkers, though.  Stay away and look elsewhere."
bad,"Management there is horrible from the top down. The only reason most of those bunch of idiots are in a management role, is because they outlasted other employees who left and got better jobs. Many have no college and nothing more than a high school education, even up to the VP level. I have never seen a more cut-throat place in all of my years in business."
bad,"I would never recommend Landstar, their management is by far the worse I have ever experienced in my life. Once you disagree with something you are forever blacklisted"
bad,I learned the logistics side of billing and brokering freight.
bad,I did not like dispatching.  I don't like we could use only black ink and no post its.  I had lost my job and just wanted an job till I could find one better pay and atomsphere
bad,The position could have been a perfect match if it weren't for the constant micromanaging by it's immature young owners. The placed no value on anyone's opinion and made rash quick decisions. They encouraged employees to lie and cheat in an attempt to make money. Most of the company has been fired or quit. Loud and uncontrollable outbursts by the owners was a daily problem.
bad,"I was hired into Landstar by my brother-in-law's father who owns the company in Owosso, MI. He had promised me anywhere from $8-$10/hour starting out and either way I'd make $10 eventually. I waited for at least 6 or 7 months before getting $8.25/hour. I had been trained poorly and each day that passed, I found I did more and more things wrong during this job. Eventually I got laid off and they never called me back. Management had an anger problem as well. Always raised their voices to employees during stressed situations."
bad,Work hours were 8-5. Were able to take hour lunches. Management was not very supportive. The work place was an OK environment got along with everyone while I was there.
bad,worst experience of my life. the people on the east coast would steal all the business from the west coast because of time zone differences.
bad,I came to this company with a bright outlook. Now I just don't know what place an educated black person has at this company.
bad,They provide the tools to do your job at a high cost to you.  If you don't have at least a working capital of at least 6 months don't work there they will put you in the hole that you can't climb out off till it's too late.
bad,"At orientation, you are told Landstar takes thirty-five percent plus other fees from your gross.  Landstar takes fifty percent of your gross after their thirty-five percent and fees.  Landstar should be more clear at orientation."
bad,"I worked there 20 years. Obviously good job security. Management keeps changing from outside sources. Annual  pay increases are very low, 1% or so. Departments don’t talk to each other. If you give management ideas they take credit."
bad,"Its fun when you establish a relationship with the people on the phone, but at first it can be stressful since you are not familiar with them. but with time it gets better."
bad,"Training disorganized and haphzard by co-workers with poor people skills. Less than 2 weeks of training on antiquated systems before being thrown into the deep end full of sharks, otherwise known as the queue. Department understaffed due to constant turnover."
bad,"This was a good starting job. But no room for any development and you pretty much work for yourself. There is not much collaboration nor sense of making a significant impact. The overall management is great, but that loses luster when the income is not steady."
bad,Landstar was a very stressful job. I didn't feel as though I was paid enough money and I believe I was nor allowed to advance within the company. I also though my managers lacked leadership ability.
bad,we did several hundred trip packets a day and our day didn't end until the last packet was entered. we also kept track of trip logs they used for there trips on hours driven.
bad,"The work I did here was fine, data entry, but I found a major flaw in their safety procedures. I would work from 6pm to 6am with truck drivers coming in and out of our trailer and be left on my own for hours with no security at all. I wasnt allowed to lock the doors and i felt very unsafe."
bad,"High standards for work and professionalism, but low appreciation of employees. "
bad,"lots of meetings,work off load board.dipatchers are not 24 hours. dispatchers are terrible. treat you like badly,at least most of them."
bad,"I enjoyed it when I started working for Landstar. Back then it was still Independent Freightways. Landstar bought them out that year and things were good for a while. We moved the building, (not the building but everything in it) in a weekend and the rewards were good. Then it started getting bad. Hired a new boss that just didn't like me for whatever reason. then we changed VP's and it got much worse because the VP would listen to the Manager instead of finding out for himself."
bad,"Landstar may be a good fit for you but it is not a good fit for everyone. High turnover, short staffed, very difficult/near impossible to advance. However, this an a solid employer and they use this to their advantage."
bad,"It is a job, pay is a little under market; however, they do their best to keep the benefits cost low.  Company is still working under old paradigm of how to manage people and their corporate structure."
bad,"This Landstar agency is a good place to work in terms of pay and quality of life, but job security is practically nonexistent. In the 6 weeks I was employed with Landstar, 6 people were terminated. The longest tenured employee in that office is only 7 weeks into the job. Minimal training is provided."
bad,"It sucked working under landstar because I never felt like I worked for the company, I worked for an agent of landstar. And he was mediocre at best. Pay was low, no communication, catty office. Not ideal working conditions. No room for advancement"
bad,"At Landstar, I quickly learned how to configure the cost of a load, and if the value was worth it to the driver and our company. I dispatched drivers as well as doing data entry. I,also, did logistics for the company based on the loads we were distributing out."
bad,"Lack of profesionalsm on their agents,canceling loads left and right and loads appear back on loadbord"
bad,"Load board will show 25,000-35,000 loads available ea day, but the reality is, you’ll find the same load posted multiple times by different agents (sometimes as much as 15x’s or more) and sometimes these agents are subagents all from the same agent and cutting each other’s throat and the rate to try and score the load, when in fact, they don’t even have the load."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of a lot of cold calls to shipper companies and finding the trucks to take them. What I've learned from this company is how to manage a whole operation over the phone. Management was a little lazy. When needing help, they would just tell me a phone number to call. He would just look at emails all day and act like he's talking to us so cameras can see he's ""working"" co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was actually making money. The most enjoyable part was learning all the tricks on how to make my job easier."
bad,I was told that I would know in 3 months if I would have a permanent position. It has now been 8 months and no promise of permanent position yet. Company also hired another person. Which now leads me to looking for Full Time Permanent work.
good,Owner was not very Cooperative was very mean would not let me have Saturdays off if I needed it just screamed and yelled and get something booked on time
good,"Management not reliable"
good,Typically ok If you can find the freight to run like you want. Your on your own pretty much. Just not enough good paying freight. They lose to much to competition.
good,The rating is based mostly of the interactions I've had with agents and other office workers. The company is average compared to others. They should do better at supporting their drivers and communications. They talk to you with no respect and most of the agents are unorganized.
good,"As the company grew, they were very proactive with stagnant times.  As they grew their good old boy system was very much alive a kicking.  "
good,"No consideration for drivers at all, just concerned about their own benefits and profit. If you have any discrepancy with brokers about the load pay or distance vs RPM, you will get not help at all, the brokers will take advantage of you any time and Landstar will do nothing about it."
good,"Learned a lot about the SDLC process."
good,Good place to work until you get a ticket or warning then you are out the door. Mandatory EOBR !!!!!
good,"The company as a whole is great. Just make sure you work for one of the good and drama free cites. Since its a brokerage firm, every office is individualy owned and not a true part of the Landstar corporation."
good,I worked for largest Landstar agency.  Our agency was peculiar because the owner was peculiar.  He was always trying to find new ways to frustrate the people that made him rich.
good,Landstar promotes from within with the whole objective to reduce salary costs. Getting an employee into a position where if they hired from outside would required fair compensation.
good,This company is all about them and not employee's. High turn over rate I will not return. Most department's makes up their own rule's. The employees' is nice for the most part.
good,"Working for this company for the most part was not so bad, the worst thing is that you have no opportunity for advancement and you are required on occasion to deal with work on the weekends that you are not compensated for and this office is poorly managed and team work does not exist in the location that I was employed at."
good,Getting up and reviewing the load board for some decent paying freight. I learned that most of the freight on the load boards didn't really compensate the OTR independent contractor. They know you are out away from home with your tractor and looking to earn some real money for doing so. But in the end if those loads aren't paying atleast $2.80/mile is it really worth being away from home with a tractor that can be very expensive to fix depending on where it decides to give you problems. Management is virtually non existent. Workplace culture is next to none because you are OTR most of the time and very rarely do you go through a terminal. The hardest part of the job is looking at the load boards that pay next to nothing. Every once in a while you will find a decent paying run that you will be able to book would be the most enjoyable part of the job. But it doesn't happen very often.
good,"The department I worked in had many difficulties. A typical day consisted of arriving early as you were expected to be on your computer working at the time your shift started, accounting for every minute of work on an excel spreadsheet that was then turned into your immediate supervisor at the end of each day where it was reviewed and compared to your login times and production stats everyday. If the times did not match exactly and discipline process was started. Prepping, scanning, indexing, releasing documents into the company-wide system. Reviewing documents of other team members before release to ensure quality. The hardest parts of the job consisted of inconsistent work schedule which usually included manual overtime with only a one day notice, extensive excel sheet time-keeping literally logging every minute of everyday, contradictory instructions of basic procedures. The enjoyable parts of the job were teamwork and quality control aspects of document review."
good,"The people and managers were friendly enough except the night shift dispatcher. She was Very rude and condensending.Very fast paced and at times stressful. I was the only one there that could do my job so lunch breaks, breaks in general, or time off was unheard of. The pay was too low at $10 an hour at the one I worked at. Some others may pay more."
good,Productive good place to work I drove for a owner opperater so no bennefits and old truck and equipment that was the bad part and reason for leaving all things connsidered a good companny to drive for except the trucks were in bad  shape
good,"Good place to work if you are in Jacksonville, no room for advancement if in Ft Worth, Good Benefits and most of the people are easy to work with.  Exception is current supervisor in Ft Worth.  Very stressful as Ft Worth does not have enough employees to cover the jobs."
good,"Working from home was fine. I am self motivated, however the job was not stable, had zero benefits and no potential for advancement or longevity.  "
good,"Makes sales calls"
good,"Since I worked from home, I can't really answer this part, because I was never in the office to see what was going on."
good,A typical day at work can be good or bad but either way it is going to be stressful. I learned a lot about the logistics industry. My co-workers are nice and always there to help. The hardest part of the job is dealing with things you can't control but get blamed for anyways and the most enjoyable part of the job is having a good day where you have multiple sales.
good,"Solid overall business model, but there are so many ""political factions"" working on the corporate level that you get virtually no corporate support. The management have very little to do with the bulk of the agency base, and are pretty much only on speaking terms with the small section of multi million dollar agents. Senior management has no real grip on the day to day market and focuses nore on the trending of the business rather than what an agency really needs. Great in some areas.... quite poor in other even though they say they ""can do it all"". Good place to work if you want to kiss someones backside to get ahead and get noticed."
good,"Alright company to work, however, sometimes lots of work on board to get a load. Have to deal at times with load being cancelled with no compensation for driving to pick up load. SitSometimes,you"
good,"The only way to make a living at that job was that if the agaents don't lie to you, send you on wild goose chases across the country for a load thats not there. Furthermore,  the town the load is supposely in is 50 miles actually further, thus less per mile and totally missleading and costly to the drivers time and pay."
good,The people are good at heart. Managers are promotion driven. Training is hard to come by. My department tried their hearts out with the tools available.
good,"I enjoyed all of the freedom that they gave the drivers."
good,"I went to this job in hopes of building a business to be proud of. Unfortunately, I found little on job training. I floundered in this business for a year and am still learning things I should have been taught when I first started. I love the work and the people I work with but I have not seemed to find the way to build a successful business. I find there is a great deal of rivalry among agents far and near and that makes building a business with limited knowledge even more difficult. I don't find the support behind the agents as there should be in getting them up and going. I don't like the charge backs that come sometimes months after the fact and no explanation as to why. I love the work but am frustrated with the job."
good,Delivering excellent services to a wide range of customers. Creating invoices and confirmations for transportation loads and complete a wide range of phone calls to different customers throughout the day.
good,Decent place to work. Bosses that are nice and will talk and help you. Flexible schedule. Training is provided but is minimum. Great office job.Just low pay.
good,Data entry rep is probably the most stressful position there. They are not a family orientated employer and the data entry rep position pay is not worth the job.
good,Working at home provides you to excel with the experience known for being in the business for many years. I like staying busy and keeping in contact with new and existing customers to grow customer bas.
good,I learned about the transportation business. I would clock in and begin my day. I never knew what kind of day it would be. Near the end it became extremely stressful due to the lack of people in the department. I ended up having to do 2 jobs inefficiently.
good,"Working from home."
good,Landstar is great for O/O’s new to the industry. Discounts could be better. The company takes far too much revenue from the drivers. Company charges for petty things and takes revenue that I feel they are not entitled to
good,"Good place to work. "
good,Great place to get experience in the industry because it is a beautiful industry. If you work hard you will learn a lot. Hardest part is drivers calling late at night but you get use to it.
good,"I have no real complaints about this company I just wished they would back me up when things would happen concerning DOT.  However, they are just like every other trucking company, they treat you good if you make them money and if you mess up then they kind of help  you but it is with restrictions."
good,Working for Landstar has been a great exsperance. Being over the road driver is something I have enjoyed but having to maintain my owner truck has not been something I have enjoyed.
good,"Stable company but very micro managed.  "
good,Had place for the workers to walk on breaks. Good lunches. Clean. went there through a temp service and got hired in. worked a lot of hours. good people
good,Had a tough time at Landstar.  I should have bought a Big Truck instead of a Dully. LTL Fright was limited in m area. I left because i  received an offer for a better paying job.
good,"On a daily basis, I was to find out what my inventory of empty trailers I would have to give to agents and making sure that our northbound freight was dispatched to drivers-owner operators. I worked with good co-workers and had a good pleasant environment."
good,"Worked over 50 hours a week and traveled between 2000-3000 miles weekly."
good,Family oriented. Well balanced schedule. They seemed to care about their employees when I worked here. They had events to even praise their employees.
good,They had a wide selection to choose from on the load board. great company for owner operators. Give owner operators a 70-30 split if you own your equipment
good,"set your own hours"
good,"At Landstar you get great fuel discounts and thats about it. Is true that you can see the load board then try to book the load thru a agent. Now the problem with that and I am speaking of personal experience is that sometimes the loads shown is already booked but the agent forgot to take it out. Nothing serious but all that time you spent calling waitting and then 2 hours later you receive a call from the agent with either a excuse of the client dont want to pay the amount shown or that the load is no longer available. Well at that point restart the whole process again and in some areas of the country it may only be one load that is going to take you where you want to go. At the end you are going to end up taking some load that may not pay what you are looking for. Another thing is that when calling Landstar and there is a problem some of the people at the office do not help much basically you are on your own if the agent do not want to pay fuel subcgarge well is all between you and him or her as long as Landstar gets the 35%. If you want to lease with them well there is 2 things you should watch out for."
good,"Big company, but has a family type atmosphere. A lot of long-term employees. Fast paced environment, but provides okay training. Great compensation package."
good,"This was a great platform to build on."
good,"I loved my job, personally, but I had communication problems with several of my co-workers. We had several fun days of potlucks, and management knows how to celebrate individuals well. I learned a lot about professional relationships - how to rebuild failing business relationships, how to increase both weak and strong business relationships, and how to manage issues with trusted partners."
good,"Most days are easy if you have booked your loads in advance. During your time there you will get to know a lot about deadheading."
good,"Always give more to make the company I am with better each day."
good,"Small company, but the work always gets done. Energetic and fun people to work with. Love the company and what it does for their employees."
good,The work was not bad.  It is what you make of it.  You get what you put in.  Home office was considerate.  They visited often.  Payment sometimes took too long.
good,"You sit a lot and deal with some difficult people on a day to day basis, but it's always nice getting treated to a free lunch once a month."
good,"A typical day at work was DOT regulated and short or as long as you made it. There was no real management to deal with, as we were O/O."
good,"I came in at 6 30 am"
good,"A typical day would start out about 6:30am. I will go to the loading boards and locate good freight. If I know of a driver in L.A. let's say as an eg: I will find the lanes that he wants to run, put them in the computer and if I locate strong paying freight, I will call him and present it to him. I have learned to spot the best paying freight and go after it aggressively. I work all alone and I am not in contact with others during my business day, except on the phone. The hardest part of the job is finding my own book of business. It takes alot of rejection and hours spent on trying to get someone to take a shot with you. Once customers are established, you have residual income .coming in."
good,"I enjoyed working for this non-asset based company as a freight broker and logistics account manager, because they have their own contracted Landstar drivers."
good,Landstar afforded me the opportunity to work from home at a critical time in my career.
good,Enjoyed my experience there everyone was very nice when it came to the work load.  Very relaxed but demanding at times.  The work was easy just the distant to get there was a problem
good,Lasndstar is an owner operator company. you set your own hours and the lanes in which you  run. you can work as hard as one cares too the freight rates do go down and increase. also a lot of cost to landstar. but over all will say it's a good company.
good,"This is a really good company for people who are good at selling things. The environment is ok, it's a normal 9-5 job. A typical day looks like arriving at the office and working on leads for the entire time. You get breaks and it's laid back."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is teaching someone something that they they did not know. There are so many new things that can be learned in the Microsoft Office Suite. When I am teaching I feel like I am invincible in the classroom. I enjoy teaching people and showing them new things that they can learn and apply in there day to day job duties or in there personal life.
good,"Had many issues with brokers and agents and landstar gave no effort to correct issues. They seem to not care about drivers needs and treat the drivers like a number, not a person."
good,Learned a lot of new skills and it has motivated me to do bigger a better things.... The flexible hours are nice and you get to talk to new people all over the country everyday
good,"Great company just needed a little ""tweeking"" management wise."
good,Made some good friends is about it. Low pay grade depending on department your in. Management is poor and always changing rules/regulations and turns out to be a cluster even when managers try to explain what's going on when they don't even know what's going on.
good,"I enjoyed the time I was there. I wish the pay was more competitive."
good,otr road truck driver. 9 years experienced as owner operator.
good,"This is a very good company to work for unfortunately the HR department is all for management and not for employees. I had a supervisor that did nothing but shop online for shoes and jeans all day, played favorites and you knew when she didn't like you and of course she was friends with the ladies in HR so they would never do nothing no matter what department or who it was. They were strictly for management and could care less for employees but it was a fun place to work at times"
good,Always improving technically due to breakneck pace of growth and challenges of integrating with numerous trading partners across the entire supply chain.
good,"Enjoy working for Landstar, main complaint is that you are at the whim of drivers.  The more loads you post the better odds of finding a driver for one of them.  Paid on commission and that depends on the size of the load.  No benefits"
good,I love what I do - love working with my customers and drivers.  This job has very demanding hours but can pay off - just not sure I work for the right agency as other agencies offer a much better compensation plan.
good,Kandahar was a great place to work but It was a temporary job so I recieved no benefits. The people are wonderful and managers regularly host games and competitions to create a fun work place
good,"This company is for owner/ operators ( owning your own equipment.)  You are your own boss here, you do not have a manager over you. We lease our equipment to Landstar."
good,It's a very fast paced place to work. The owner was very friendly. The manager was also very friendly. I tried to ensure all needs were met to the best of my ability.
good,"You work with company brokers,and they work well with you, They try not only to have lot of loads, but also to encourage all drivers to bee safe and keep up their spirit."
good,"Plenty of loads and at good rates. 65% isn't high enough to me and Landstar nickel and dime you. Horrible Trailer Management Team though..people Are waiting 2 to 3 weeks for an empty trailer, which is ridiculous. I'm not leaving due to that,  personal reasons, but they really need to improve that area."
good,"You pretty much know what your signing up for. It's an over the road job and you work as much or as little as you like. Landstar is a good company, the only problem is they get slow in the winter for flatbed and the rates are way down right now."
good,"Good place to work , hours were not great. Got to meet a lot a different people and interact with customers as well as drivers on a daily basis. Made sure customer was satisfied."
good,"At the end of my time with Land Star the rates had dropped.  my truck was over 1,000,000 miles and I had to sell.  My repair bills the last year were well over $30,000 and still not being fixed properly.  Mostly from the Kenworth dealerships that were supposed to be the most qualified all they were good for stealing my money price gouging me triple or quadruple the price of what the repair should cost putting me out of business. I wasn’t able to coordinate with the sales department and the department at Land Star to set up all the new paperwork after a week of going back-and-forth with that I got frustrated and gave up."
good,No forced dispatch. Book loads for yourself and only go to areas you want to go. You get paid by percentage of the load. Very safe minded company and it shows.
good,I am looking for employment else where because Landstar does not pay very well. Management is good but could work on better communication with the staff.
good,I learned about Delphi while there and worked with lots of different people who were very knowledgeable.  I worked basically on my own projects and not exactly on a team which led me to learn how to manage my workload.
good,"A day at work involves handling a large amount of phone calls which require keeping lines of communication open with internal and external customers to insure that pickups and deliveries are made in the time frames that are established for the routes.   As problems arise, this communication is vital to the mission of the department.  Duties also include monitoring customer websites, starting incident reports for problems, and provide documentation through the AS400 computer system to assure all paperwork and delivery information is provided for timely billing processes."
good,A typical day starts out by posting freight on my load board and matching up trucks that can run these lanes.  I have to coordinate all pick ups and deliveries.  The hardest part of this job is the troubleshooting when drivers break down or roads are closed due to in climate weather.
good,The coworkers are very nice and like to help the new employes.
good,Came into the business during a recession and transportation needs were extremely limited.
good,"I came to work at Landstar after being out of work for a few months. I was hired because of my experience in dealing with contracts and understanding legal terminology.  I have learned quite a bit about transportation and how the products that we consume are transported."
good,This is a very large company with several Landstar division. Employees get lost in the crowd so you feel like you are only a face in the crowd.. Benefits are ok.
good,Learned business to business sales. Good experience. Helps expand your network.
good,Pay could be better but overall it is a great company. Good benefits and they really do care about their employees. Some of the management gives of the snobby and entiled vibe though.
good,this was the best part about the job.  I was able to have a home office.  the reward program for agents that reached revenue goals was always top notch.
good,Good loads fun place too work. Other drivers do there best to help u succeed. Teachers an trainers very well informed about load board and lunches are provided!
good,It was a very easy learning experience to jump into the logistics field and you never really stop learning once youre in. It was a great stepping stone to learn the structure of the business
good,"The best is to own your own truck however you can work for an owner,  Compensation is 65% but you have high dollar freight. They post some fuel in advance."
good,"As in anything in life, where you go and how you succeed depends on how much you apply yourself and the skills you develop along the way."
good,"A typical day was to call clients for loads, then find drivers for those loads. I learned a little about the freight industry, and became HAZMAT certified. Management is okay, but if you need the customer service department be prepared to be on hold for a while. The hardest part of the job was trying to find drivers for low revenue loads. The most enjoyable part of the job: having a load deliver safe and sound."
good,"Allow you to success in business is not a right. It's a reward for a well executed business plan. One of the biggest pluses to being an owner operator for this company is being able to take time off whenever you want without being hassled. If you can’t do this, stay with your current company."
good,"Working with customers and shipping lines"
good,"I really liked this company for 5 years, I made good money and consistent work, than they changed management and went downhill, so I left"
good,"See my previous review for Landstar. Although the Logs dept that I have seen recently has organizational problems and delegation problems. The employees are so stressed out right now. It was a great department when I worked there. Now, not so much."
good,"Recruiting Drivers/Owner Operators. Dispatching, Tracing, Sales, Customer Service, Billing, Payroll, Hours of Service, AR/AP. Setting appointments on future deliveries to customers and keeping appointments updated. Make sure all accessorials are sent and updated for payment and billing. I had a lot of great challenges here as Landstar had their own Nationwide Dispatch Board so I was able to do load matching also in order to bring in more revenue and a back haul for drivers allowing them also extra pay. Very fast paced and keeping me busy so the day would coast by. Really enjoyed the loadmatching for the extra revenue for the Company."
good,look for and get loads from point A to B. There is no management to speak of in less you mess up.
good,Come in at 8AM start working with phone calls comingfrom drivers. Giving fuel payouts along with booking loads for drivers. We have a high volume of loads that come in from customers as well as rate request. Its an high temp day most days. I have learned how to multi task meeting many customer request. As well how to manage the company the way they like it to be ran. I love transportation everything about it. I like the challenges it brings as well as talking to people.
good,Working with people all over the country and with many divisions of thoes companies was great. By working with a wide range of people always kept my skills fresh in the brokering business. I learned to juggle multiple jobs and skills at the same time. Love that part. I enjoyed turning customers into life long clients by building their confidence and respect for me and the company. Hardest part would have to be management. The best part was the cleints that have become life long friends.
good,"Landstar has been a great business partner in the past, but this past year, the freight hasn’t been near as good as years past. A lot of freight is now brokered out, as it keeps the liability off of Landstar, while improving their profitability. It is still possible to make a decent profit here, but I’d recommend checking out other avenues, including going completely independent on authority"
good,"Provide customer updates"
good,"Landstar is one of the leading 3PL's in the country, they specialize in covering all aspects and modes of the transportation industry. They are strictly an Independent contractor company."
good,"Current management tried to find new ways to improve productivity; however, many older employees were reluctant and sometimes resistant to any kind of process changes."
good,"Credit Review Process for New Customers"
good,"The company supplies us with free coffee, tea and water.  We have a place downstairs like a cafe' where we can get breakfast or lunch.  We learn something new in our department all the time because we are constantly changing our rules for certain objectives.  The managers help with departmental duties so often they don't get the opportunity to supervise when most appropriate.  The co-workers are nice and have a great work ethic.  The hardest part of the job is our annual reviews where we evaluate ourselves; then the manager re-evaluates you only to determine they've decided on your raise based on their evaluation only (before a discussion between the two of you has occurred).  The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking with different agents, customers and co-workers with their optimistic outlooks. Did I mention free coffee, tea and water?"
good,"I would arrive each morning and check my voice mails. check my emails. Start calling all my drivers that were under a load and check in with them and get a status update. call all my customers and give updates and get new load info and start trying to get the loads filled with drivers."
good,a very fast paced way of life if you want to make a good living. very costly equipment involved in this way of life. very costly insurance premiums.  but if you hustle and get with the right agents pretty good money
good,"Great company ,great benefits and good people , fast paced environment ...Gotta be able to keep up and be consistent . Come to work with a postive attitude and everything will go smooth.."
good,Landstar provides tool that help you become a successful owner operator. The load board has many opportunities to make the income you desire.
good,"The days were consistently busy with downtime through out the day, typical rushes were expected. I learned a lot about the inner workings of freight transportation and logistics. the management was fair. The majority of the co-workers were easy to work with informative and helpful, with the exception of a few. The hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed and not having help, as my co-workers were in the same position, customer care took a hit here and there because we were short staffed most times. It was an enjoyable job for the fact I could work from the comfort of my home over a provided laptop and VoIP Phone."
good,I Would call truckers and move or sale loads. I would also dispatch trucks and put information into computer systems. The management was great and I enjoyed the people that worked there.
good,Since I have started with this company they have made me feel very welcome and appreciated for the job that I do.   We are a small office and everyone that works in the office is focused on what the needs of our customers are and we understand that if we do not take care of them.   We wont have jobs.
good,"A typical day at work involves responding to RFQs from the US. Government for their transportation needs. I also analyze revenue comparing to projected plan."
good,good company lots of freedom and i was able to dispatch my self. ............
good,I like the sense of security working with a large company. They have the tools and the resources to help me run and maintain my business. They have opportunities for you to run the business has you see fit.
good,"Always worked with the team to reach our goal, call new customer each week to try and get more dedicated lanes, always looking for the best rates possible to benefit the company."
good,"Depending on who was your manager, you may or may not be happy here. I had a wonderful boss at first but when she left, I was very unhappy with her replacement, which is why i left."
good,"You get out of the job what you put into it. As a regular employee I was pressured constantly. As a manager, I was given more lenience but not supported in my position."
good,Great way to connect with drivers and customers.  It is a 24/7 job but is a lot less stressful than working with a trucking company that does forced dispatch.  I work from home so it is convenient but it is also very demanding.  I love the job but do not make as much money as I would like.
good,"I enjoyed my time as an account manager working with Landstar.  I was independently contracted through another agent so they unfortunately took a subsequent amount of my pay form me but other wise I was always treated fairly, Landstar was always in my corner and I learned an incredible amount about the Logistics industry."
good,With working with the DOT and Government caused our layout of the department to constantly change.  It allowed me to learn new things monthly and sometimes daily.
good,"Starting in a Data Entry position, I worked my way to specialist and then customer service and finally auditor and department trainer. I found it very easy to move up if you simply did you job well and learned all you could. I had to learn about deadlines and fuel taxes, mileage taxes and many more. As in any large company management teams ebb and flow. This tended to be the hardest part of the job as each management team have different styles. The best part of the Job is the company's involvement with the employees."
good,"Landstar is a company that excels with their attention to safety. As a cargo loss prevention analyst, I was on the front lines, and the first point of contact for any cargo incident occurring on the road. Typically during foul weather, the number of incidents increase, and it can be rather busy. However, on a yearlyy basis our incident and theft numbers consistently fall beneath the national average."
good,"Typical day at work, starts anytime your ready; before 8am. LOL "
good,"Talk with the agent"
good,"Good Work Environment Of People to work with. The Job Duties within itself Every situation is Different, but the Goal is to Get It Done.. Overall, Landstar is a Great Company to work for."
good,A pleasant and fun place to work. Phone sales are a major reason for success. Management offered opportunities for increased sales potential. Friendly atmosphere.
good,Good salary. Good pay. Works around outside life well. Can be stressful but what job can’t. Would recommend to anyone looking for a 9-5 job. Good environment
good,"Very production oriented workplace - great co-workers and good management.  Lots of sorting of documents, scanning of documents, and indexing of documents."
good,"Nice owners, they were very fair and cared about there staff, little busy and demanding but a good solid company to work for. i learned alot from the owners"
good,I enjoyed my time there.  Having to leave due to injury and family matters I still would have returned there if not for a different job opportunity in Health Care
good,Pay vendor via as400 .. Approving with the proper back up paper work Open mail and distribute to appropriate areas. Setup new vendor in Express Handle incoming phone call payment inquirer. Open and sort incoming mail. I am responsible for the Streamline account in as400.
good,"Landstar System, Inc. is a worldwide asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions delivering safe, specialized transportation services to a broad range of customers utilizing a network of agents, third-party capacity owners and employees."
good,This was not a 9 to 5 job. This was intense. Everything was on a time line. If we didn't book a truck we didn't leave until it was booked.
good,"Very happy to be part of this great QA team, learn a lot of new processes and different styles since went through 4 managers in 5 years."
good,"good place to work, learned to manage my company.  would work for that company again without reservation.  They provided a good orientation and a person to help after orientation was over."
good,Fast paced and good environment to learn many things. Great place to start my management experience.  Can be very stressful due to high volume
good,Best lease ever at first. Agents started getting greedy and cutting rates and blaming shoppers for reduced rates. Not true in many cases I had his repoire with many of my shippers and the confirmed this.
good,"Managed staff, reports, time off / vacation requests, timesheets. Learned from the bottom up, literally and worked myself into a management position."
good,Typical day at Landstar is speaking with clients and answering calls. This is a very competitive job you spend most of the day brokering loads and sending out quotes to clients. The hardest part of the job would entail bids. Basically pricing out 2 or 3 pages of different lanes and crossing your fingers to see if you at least get one. The most enjoyable part of the job is the is working as a time and the accomplishment you feel when you walk out after a great day of work. 
good,"Many employees of this company have been employed there for 10, 15, 20 and even 30 years. There is a wonderful sense of job security and this is very important in today's market."
good,"My day mostly was inputing data and posting payments, I had great co-workers and managers."
good,Landstar is a great company having a really great work setup and amazingly sportive environment for beginners . Overall I had a good experience with them.
good,"Landstar was a great place to work. The people and management were nice, and Landstar also had good benefits."
good,"I enjoyed  working at landstar I was able to book my own loads a d had more home time and still made money. You, get to work with different agents, Landstar has Freight just about anyway in the country for drivers to haul."
good,"Over the road driver . About 700 miles per day. Manage paperwork and deal with customers.  Work with dispatch,  take c a real of breakdowns aND maintenance of truck"
good,Very professional atmosphere however there is limited opportunities for growth.  I have learned a great deal about the industry over the 16  years with the company.  I have had no issues with any of my co-workers.  If you put in the time to learn your craft the work is not hard. I enjoy how involved they are with the community.
good,"the ability to self scheduale and interact with company agents, personal, and costumers, truely making the business your own grants a great opertunity for any owner of a long haul truck."
good,Great company I was an owner operator no complaints I was my own boss I was able to get online pick up my own load if I need to be at home for couple days it was easy
good,"Landstar was a joyful place to work. The company is organized well and informs the staff on their expecations and any changes to company well in advance. I was responsible of making sure the freight drivers were in accordance to DOT laws, testing, and assist with their freight assignments."
good,"Limited opportunity for advancement. Seeking more reliable income."
good,"This was an awesome job I wouldve stayed, but I cant make ends meet off of commission."
good,I think they were a pretty good company just the percentage that they paid per load.If you set up a good route you could be really successful.You have to call to set up your load from the load alert you receive form your phone or computer.Once you get to a location make sure that you have a load coming back thats worth wild.
good,"There was very little training, no job security, no equal rights employment but the hours were great and I did enjoy my position there will I was there."
good,Landstar is a great company!  They just have a few strict rules that you can have you have your lease terminated.  They help with repairs maybe up to 10k is what I've been told.
good,"This is a great team of people, if i could stay with this company and live in Savannah I most certainly would! The major issue is the pay rate, I can not and do not know many people who can survive on 10.00 per hour."
good,Landstar is an outstanding company to work with! They service all of North America including Mexico and Canada. All 9400 drivers are HAZMAT endorsed.
good,Necessary tools provided for you to succeed in the work field. Training was provided as well along with support through out your time there. Fast paced environment.
good,"Posting loads and working with Landstar drivers,searching for the loads and making connection with customers. Very stressful job but I enjoy working in transportation . Landstar is a great company but have to have better agency managers and must sign contract ."
good,Company is very professional. Everyone is willing to help. They also stay on top of your classes and certifications and inspections ensuring that your vehicle is safe.
good,"Landstar is a great place to work. The company is kinda old school in regards to working remote. Other than that, one of my favorite places to work.Would defiantly recommend."
good,The management does an excellent job at adapting to situations to help the team members figure out the best method for the individual. The entire company cares about their employees.
good,I absolutely love my job; along with my coworkers and upper management. I truly enjoy what I do everyday. I am able to assist our drivers and agents in the best way possible.
good,excellent place to work for....for otr drivers .you pick your own loads and went wherever you wanted...the pay was different depending on the load and the miles.
good,"Great job.  Just didnt make the money I want.  Want to get back into medical sales.  was very good at selling medical supplies.  went through bad divorce and was not willing to relocate at that time, so I lost my job."
good,"I loved working here. Management was far, and gave bonuses based on performance. Everyone was supportive of each other, and pitched in when needed."
good,I worked the for almost 8 years . I enjoyed working for that company. they were very customer service oriented and that included the employees
good,On a typical day I would log into all of my systems and check my email for any action items that needed to be addressed.  After determining order of importance I would proceed to handling all requests.  I would also contact agents to get a feel for their business and what they needed to be successful.  I would give at least 2 one-hour power point presentations a week which covered the sales cycle and other selling tips.
good,"I learned a lot about the transportation industry with this company, It was a small family owned company that was sadly bought out by a big corporation."
good,"Excellent company to start your own business, and drive your own truck. Offers many great opportunities."
good,"as a owner operators company, you make  as  much money as you want to make, but there is limit, its hard to find nice agents, and you are by your self."
good,The art of negotiation. Every load YOU get you get to negotiate so sharpen up on those skills. Build relationships with those agent's everyday and surely you will see$$$. Do not take detention pay have the agent break it up in unloading/loading or any other code you only get paid on detention when the customer pays 1month to 2 months down the road. Allways got paid never got stiffed. Above all don't violate safety rules safety doesn't play.
good,"Rates have dropped significantly through no fault of Landstars. Other companies have started underbidding the freight due to the  tariffs. I work way harder to make "
good,"Begin with answering calls from customers and drivers."
good,drove all over the country got payed well but not a lot of home time i just drove the truck that some one own not me. working with landstar was fine the owner was the thing that got us out of the truck but that's trucking
good,"Very demanding and stressful work tasks but the management in my department made it very bearable.  The calls we would get from capacity, dispatch and agents  can make you wants to run out of the building. The management of our department was very aware of it and made sure that we understood that it was not the end of the world and there was only so much we could do."
good,It is not the type of job for the faint of heart.  This was something I always wanted to do.  It was a very unique experience.  I saw many things is this great country that I may not have been able to do with any other typical job.  The hardest part was being away from home for a month or longer at times.  My co worker was my husband.  The management was always very helpful and polite.  I wouldn't trade the five plus years I had at this job for anything.
good,"The success is completely in the driver's hand.% 💯 owner operator company .. what you choose you will be paid for. No blame on others.. At all.  But far the best company to work for. If you don't know how to think and make decisions on your own,,, this is not the place for you.. You dispatch yourself.   You are running your own business."
good,Excellent owner operator co to work fo. They are up on all the rules and regulations and inspections . They have a good agent base so the loads are well priced and have easy access to there Owner Operators.
good,I loved the the job their the atmosphere was so amazing and so are the people that I worked with. It wasn't nothing hard about the job it was very enjoyable.
good,I was a BCO AKA owner operator truck driver. LandStar has great people working for them. You are your own boss as a BCO deciding your own loads and scheduling within the needs of the customers. But your days off are on your schedule for the most part. Although LandStar wants to see a minimal load acceptance to justify keeping a assigned trailer. Your paid percentage of load.
good,"Typical day in trucking logistics consists in checking on loads already moving and finding new loads to match with drivers. "
good,Job security good place to work have to be self sufficient some season are better than others not enough dedicated freight I looking for freight that gets me home every weekend
good,You will succeed here !! If you are good at sales this is the place... What I like most about it is that you can write your own check as opposed to waiting for some review.
good,Great large trucking company to be agent for. They help you along the way. Always there to answer questions. Sky is the limit when comes to earning potential.
good,"Self motivation to obtain, maintain, and negotiate contracts for businesses to business transportation needs is the daily routine. Every day is a little different and requires negotiation skills for the customer as well as the trucking company and the driver responsible for delivering the supplies/equipment to the desired location in a timely matter. It is enjoyable to talk with drivers as they transport across the US, Canada, and Mexico tracking their progress and taking into consideration extenuating circumstances that can delay delivery: inclement weather causing road closure, breakdowns,"
good,was a nice place to work until they bring the electronics logs and I understand is federal but they job and the loads don't match the money we can earn
good,"Corporate thick of it, however with the proper environment and position majority of the culture will look to promote or safe guard you and your position - in most circumstances, unless restructuring, etc."
good,Clerical position held in trucking industry. Contract ended with ford. Was a wonderful place to work at.  Job title included manifesting bills and generating information based on clients information.
good,"I learned a lot of transportation information from the owners of this agency.  Rating, load sourcing, dispatching, and billing.  It was fun working with the drivers that ran the 20 trucks owned by this agency, and the family atmosphere that was created."
good,Great place to learn the logistics industry for those who want to earn their way to a great career.  If youre a driven individual the management will help give you the tools needed for success. Competitive atmosphere but always friendly and wanted my colleague's success alone with mine.
good,Learned so much about the industry from working here. Waking up and coming to work is not dreadful because of the laid back friendly environment. Everyone has their own strong area of skill that you can bounce ideas off and learn from while creating your own area of expertise.
good,"- a typical day at work was fast paced, very little time to breathe"
good,"Owner-Operator responsible for finding, booking, and driving and delivery of our loads/freight.  Handle all compliance and safety records and procedures for DOT and Landstar, and maintain personal records, ELD/logbook and maintenance of my own vehicle."
good,Landstar is a good employer Saftey  conscious Laid-back and relaxed company you pick your own loads work as hard or little as you want just have to watch the loads you take and some of the brokers you pull for Landstar is for the driver get everything in writing or a email so you have proof of what the broker told you Landstar will take care of lying unfair brokers
good,The hardest part of the job is getting yourself booked on loads while trying to get your current load delivered safely and on time. You have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want. You also had the freedom to go home when you wanted.
good,It’ll get you the income you need to survive for your business. You can choose different brokers to carry freight from in different states around the country.
good,You have to keep your truck in  good conditions all the time     On this company you  don’t have a dispatch so you have to be very good to  manage your work.  And excellent  Company to work.  You have to be dependable Landstar has a high satisfactory   Customer record.
good,Great company to work for. You can choose your own lanes to run. Great discounts on fuel and tire purchases. Home time is whenever you want. A lot of bad agents though.
good,Made Money and spent quality time with my Husband. We owned our truck and it was great while it lasted. Unfortunately He died in July and I do not want to be OTR alone.
good,"Safety first. I owned my own truck at time with Landstar. Had a roadside violation & was left go. Then I retired. I don't wish to own any equipment & looking for a part time driving job, however I would consider full time dedicated runs with home time for south east. Prefer nights and weekends so to have time off during week days"
good,"good place great training for new recruits, but no career plan for agents, But the broker Land star is one of the best brokers nationwide with a solid supply chain platform and good BCOs programs"
good,I have been a agent for about a year. It took me a while to put through a load but I finally did. I am on a roll now . Thanks to all I have learned here and such great support to new agents on learning the system. Commission only but the experience and education is well worth it!
good,Loved the company I just couldn't catch onto the load board and went back to Knight Refrigerated. Landstar is a company where you find your own freight off the load board and I was spending way to much time trying to figure it out than I was running loads.
good,"When I started at Landstar, I did not know anything about the transportation  business. I was trained for each position and informed of the change that were to come. I love working for Landstar. I learned to volunteer and really enjoyed it. Landstar has dedicated workers."
good,"Great company, ever changing transportation and warehouse business. Company offered self improvement classes such a getting along with others and time management. Also offered professional improvement such as Microsoft Office courses and customer service. Great benefits. Most co-workers made the day enjoyable and some management. Like all companies, there are people in management positions who have poor leadership skills, but seem to advance."
good,Best part of working for landstar is no forced dispatch. You pick your loads and choose when you get home and how much you make per mile.
good,"My job consistied of reviewing log books, annual reviews, physicals for over the road truck drivers. I learned DOT regulations and had a good relationship with my co workers and my manager."
good,"Although the work day was fast and demanding my team,, supervisor and management was very supportive when needed. I love the fact that they didn't micro-manage and value their employees' hard work. It's truly a great place to work."
good,Handled incoming and outgoing telephone call from truck drivers on a daily basis. Assisted with tax and fuel issues. Audited daily driver logs. Ensured drivers were in compliance with DOT rules and regulations. Issued violations when needed.
good,This is a great company to work for and I really enjoyed my time with them.  This company offers a variety of benefits and opportunities to excel and prosper.
good,One of the best companies for a owner operator. At least you get to decide what freight you haul and for how much. I think the benfit of Landstar is that its all owner operators. No companies driver to compete with. Your treated like a business partner not some employee.
good,This is a great place to work for someone who owns their truck.  You have the opportunity to pick your own loads and the sky is the limit!
good,Truly the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside such wonderful and experience staff that showed me key skills for later usage.
good,"This company is the best to work for, the people you meet and friends you keep here are awesome. Management is great, some departments are different more micro managing then others but you can advance and transfer with in the company. You will work believe me but you do your job and you are ok. No one really leaves once your in the door and some come back like i did. Overall this has been the best company i have ever worked for."
good,The culture with Landstar is very warm and has lots of room for growth.
good,"My position was required to bill 150 bills on average a month.  I maintained 170-200 billing average.  I learned many skills such as customer service focus, and took all classes (when available) that Landstar offered, i.e. Excel, Word,Customer Service, and others specifically created through Landstar. "
good,I was treated like human being which is rare in big companies. Also they were there for me when I a breakdown (mechanical that is).
good,My thoughts are the same for Landstar Logistics as Landstar Express America. Great place to work!
good,"Landstar is thee best owner operator company on the highway, PERIOD .From their rates to there upstanding level of quality employees. It has been nothing but a blessing working here."
good,"Just wished they hadn't panicked when the real estate market burst and withdrawn to undeveloped land only."

good,"My job in customer service mainly consisted of scheduling multi stop truck loads and data entry of schedules. This included a lot of correspondence with the drivers, shippers, and receivers. The position also included claims resolution and billing."
good,"It's lot of competitive drivers there but I like working at my on pace"
good,It was a over all good place to work at first. The hours were good and no weekends. They kept pushing you to reach wuotas then once you reached that quota they would keep upping your goals
good,Landstar was a great opportunity to work remotely and independently. Plenty of resources and tools made available to Landstar agents. Sales goals were very obtainable.
good,Excellent place to work. You are your own boss. Owner operating is the way to go if you are a truck driver and working for landstar is your best option.
good,"Scheduling freight, learned to win bids for new business, Helpful experienced management, helpful knowledgeable coworkers, hardest part of the day is to not have equipment for scheduling, the most enjoyable part of the job is that the company is big enough that you can call other agents for help"
good,It was a life changing experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. the hardest part of this job was dealing with the Canada Border Patrol.
good,It was a job that you looked forward to each day. Challenging yet exciting...Freight Brokerage and dealing with all types of people in a commercial enviornment.
