rating,review
bad,immediate managers are trying to get a cut by agencies frequently hiring and firing contract workers. Do not treat contractors with respect. Going straight to a permanent is ok.
bad,"This opportunity is especially exciting as my professional goals align with [Target Company]'s"
bad,I learned working for Duke that management do not appreciate their employees. Also work long hours and with little pay. I do not recommend this company to any one
bad,"Duke Energy, at least in Lake Mary, treat their contractors terribly! No opportunities to grow. They assign work above pay-grade without compensation. I was doing level 3 engineering (complete engineering of substations) and assigned to review large projects (tracing all cable connections and inputs and outputs), but only considered a Drafting Technician. I was reprimanded for not being at my desk, but I had to collaborate with other engineers in various locations."
bad,Don’t give a notice to when you find a job elsewhere making way more money. They will fire you!! No work life balance at all and the management is a joke!
bad,"Great company, but there are many snakes in the grass. I enjoy my job but you cant just walk in and do your job without being involved in the politics."
bad,They expect you to take time off during an outage so the house r.P. Techs can get all the overtime.That is  how they treat the contract r.P. Employees..
bad,When the shift started in the morning I had to go thru this long process of logging into my computer system which always made EVERYBODY late clocking in cause the computers were outdated and slow. Then immediately the phones would start ringing once you got logged in and they didn't stop until you logged out for a break. Your bathroom and break time is monitored. If you're in after call time for longer then a minute you get a bunch of emails from supervisors and then they kick you out the system like you left work so now you have to log back in again.
bad,"Training is ok as it is 8-5 but it lasts for 10 weeks, 2 additional weeks if you work any shift after 2 pm and rolls into after hours. That training is from 2pm-10:30 at night but you aren't told about that additional training until the week before. They don't care about you as a person.   Calls are back to back and all you get are people cursing and screaming because they didn't pay THEIR bill. The management contradicts you, making you look like you don't know what you're doing when they train you to not do something and then when a customer complains they do it anyway. It's stressful and they only want you to answer the phone and have zero aux time to breath between calls.For a 12 hour shift you only got a 30 minute lunch break. I had headaches daily and had anxiety attacks often after i started working here and I've worked in many call centers before. This by far has been the worst."
bad,I don't recommended. Too much of politics. no security. You could work will be working with convicted felon. Expect to work 10 hours a day with no overtime. The processes change consistently and you should do all the changes. You will be taking orders from lower level employee just because they are a family member of a higher supervisor.
bad,I would never work here again. id rather be a hobo in the streets of charlotte than work for this company again. this was the worst career choice ive made.
bad,"For the most part Duke Energy wasn't applying good work ethics to the Projects I worked on, and was using out dated Civil Surveying information, and lacked leadership in the Project Management Departments of which I worked."
bad,"Silly, silly place.  The main question would from management always be, should I scratch my watch or wind my butt.  Too many hands and too many chiefs."
bad,the managers are not nice and the way they treat the employees were not good. maybe now it may be better but then it was not a very great work environment
bad,Job uncertainty is constant and workers are not made aware of the risk of job loss.  You work one day and the next you are gone.
bad,"You are treated like a number from day 1 of interviews. You take a 3 hour test and interview if you pass. Barely anyone passes. HR is so disorganized and training classes never being on time and clueless in when they start.  "
bad,"I've applied for a Position X which required my relocation (from Ohio to South Carolina). On my first day at work I was told that this position is not available and I was offered Position suX at the nuclear plant. After one year I left Duke Energy because they don't pay much for 'radioactive environment' which will mess you up: hair loss, cancers, etc."
bad,"I worked for 3 years as a contractor, when it was Progress Energy it was a great company to work for, everyone was treated equally, was told after 2 years I would become a permanent employee, that was nixed once Duke took over the company.  "
bad,I would never return to this position. The pay rate and customers make the pay not worth the stress.
bad,"Upper Management staff at the Plainfield, IN location should be replaced.  My supervisor actually went into my personnel file and changed the dates on my fmla form in order to cut 6 mos off of my personal fmla time.  This is a federal offense and not only should she have been fired, she should have been charged.  Her higher up swept the whole incident under the rug and advised me that I should chalk it up to my supervisor's ""lack of knowledge""!  really?  OK. NOT.  I got tired of endlessly getting written up by this supervisor after this fmla incident because she was now basically out to get me because I went ""over her head"".  Isn't that illegal as well?  Not at Duke Energy. Also, we  (CSR's) were  given pagers  as if we were EMT's or doctors  so that Duke could call us to work at any hour on any day because of bad weather or just because too many people called in on that particular day.  This was not an option, it was mandatory.  Yes, we were on 24 hour call! Upper management is just a joke.   The other CSR's and the team leads were wonderful.   Too bad THEY weren't in charge.   I have never worked for a more non-moralistic company.  Customer service at Duke Energy is a joke.  They could care less about their customers.  Trust me.  They don't care."
bad,"The company regularly changes policy that literally takes from the already over worked staff, monetarily,  professionally and socially. They promote a high stress environment and critique everything you do. Even at a highly awarded level of service I was made to feel as though my performance was never good enough."
bad,"I thought I had really achieved a goal when I was hired at Duke Energy but to my dismay I was blind sided to the lack of IT automation and management arrogance that made life miserable to endure on a daily basis.  The old Duke Energy prior to the Progress Energy acquisition was the company everyone raved and gloated to work and be apart of, but now it was a stepping stone to the next company."
bad,Clanish management where favorites are treated better.   Management is ignorant to concerns of new employees. You can lose your position without warning or management pointing out any errors. Stay clear from this self centered patanoid environment
bad,"Management clearly needs to figure out why there is such a turnover in the Call Center. Perhaps it is due to lack of support, only telling someone what they do wrong especially if they are new. You aren’t going to know 3 states worth of policies right off the bat. It takes time."
bad,Duke energy is a company that I could no longer work for after finding out how they defraud customers via billing/energy. Personal morale and standards is what would influence anyone to leave Duke Energy.
bad,"I was not paid for 3 months. Took them to court which ordered them to pay what they owed me by the end of the year and waited until late December to pay me. So it took another 3 months before I received pay."
bad,"the company  was great, working here was reason of pride and we took care and dedication in a job   all that is gone and the call center is living nightm"
bad,"Doing the job of 3 people while being threatened to have your job cut as well. ""If you don't like it, there's the want ads"" is an actual quote from management."
bad,NO comment Call center is terrible. You have to know someone to move up and the stats you have to meet is just unbearable. they done want you to even go to the bathroom
bad,"I dislike the Customer Care position. They treat you like work should be the focus of your life. There are constantly signs of nepotism, which is really disturbing. They can schedule you to work 12 hour shifts and make you come in to work on your days off with no regards to plans you have. I truly detest they culture of Duke Energy, give all you time and energy to the company and don't work to improve yourself. The people only care about who you know to move up in the company. I never can feel like the company has my best interest in mind"
bad,"Management was stiff & strict ignoring areas that would even be beneficial to productivity.  Tried to bring personal computer accessories that were in line with IT policy to help be more productive, but was not approved by manager."
bad,"It's best to get a job through duke energy its self and not it's contractors NCO, EGS we do the same thing as duke energy employees but don't get paid half of what they are making"
bad,"Duke energy has great benefits, however there turnover rate is extremely high! Worst call center! Do not pay enough to deal with all the negativity from supervisors and customers! They micro manage everything that you do! If you call off for anything you have to worry abt if you’ll have a job when you come back!"
bad,Duke Energy has really hit rock bottom with the people they choose as directors and managers for security. Cover ups and wrong doings are the normal operation at McGuire nuclear station!! If you sleep with security management you are sure to get a promotion to any job you Desire and get paid even if you don’t work.
bad,"Management is horrible, no clue on how to run anything.  Constantly violates our union contract, do yourself a favor and find another company to work for."
bad,My experience at Duke Energy was wonderful when I got hired and went downhill FAST thanks to this Third Party Indian company that somehow owned the entire Helpdesk. I would absolutely work for Duke again if it weren't for them.
bad,Poor management that isn't put in check. Workplace culture difficult.  No authority and autonomy provided.  Limited advancement opportunity.  Very hierarchical.
bad,Duke Energy is not a good diverse place to work.  Supply Chain department management style is more about favorites. They need treat there employees better.
bad,"Extreme favoritism and mismanagement.  Continuous in-fighting between the Progress Energy and Duke employees post-merger.  This organization is truly a boys club, advancement is based upon favoritism and not performance."
bad,Was never given the work that was described in the job description. My direct boss was too busy to train me to take over the responsibilities I was hired for. This led to my contract being ended abruptly one day. Duke and my contract company fought my unemployment and lost as there was no evidence of wrongdoing or corrective actions on my part.
bad,"Duke preaches work/life balance but it's only words. My department was poorly manage but the leadership issues are from the Corp. level down. Duke has grown faster than they have the expertise to keep up with. They hire experts and then choose not to listen to them."
bad,"Very hard job, Customer service here is very busy customer are very upset with there bills. You must had a very calm soul. Because you will be push to the limit of your skills."
bad,"Indecisive, incompetent managers and dysfunctional leadership.  Organization does not embrace change.  People are placed in role without any regard to skills or experience."
bad,"Unfortunately, with the merger, unexperienced mangement has been moved into positions of power over people.  The policies make it impossible to do anything about abusive management, bullies, or outright jerks (especially in IT).  It is currently impossible for employees to get away from these individuals (policy that people cannot work for anyone other than their current managers) or do anything about them (ethics hotline does not answer or return eMail, phone calls, etc. and HR essentially is nothing except a phone maze to providers).  Employees of some managers are ordered to be in their chair in their cube 10 to 16 hours a day with 1/2 hour mandatory lunch, weekends, evenings, vacations, holidays, etc. and to be on call 24 hours a day (and respond to all requests within 15 minutes) or be fired.  The culture from the CIO down is toxic at this time and has been heading in that direction for years.  Additionally, it is next to impossible to get another job in the Charlotte area because practically every consulting firm has someone placed here and will not even talk to you unless you leave first.  Management is very confrontational and work in a blame oriented environment.  It is rather sad that this utility believes it is 'too large to fail, too arrogant to care, and too important to be touched either internally or by the law (yes employees are ordered to bill their time to capital projects they do not work on so the company can recover the costs from the ratepayers and then told to lie about it if they get caught)."
bad,My Mgr was in another state so communication was terrible. Culture is very clique ish. Oldies keep out the newbies. Temps rarely hired.  I actually was told id ger hired until a long time employee ran my name in the dirt.  Very political! Just not worth it! Happiness hard to find here!
bad,Over expectant management. I believe they need to read their own policies very carefully and put a stop to the bullying and favoritism in the work place.
bad,Upper management makes poor decisions. Good job but lack of employee appreciation and favoritism is driving good employees to leave the company. Most people are not happy here.
bad,"They dont want to pay their contractors and when we ask for more,  they outsource our work and lay us off. they string you along and make you responsible for other peoples work."
bad,"HR dos not look out for employees at all, they are solely there for the company itself.  Contract employees are segregated from a lot of team activities.  You get locked into one position for a year, and not always with a pay increase."
bad,"Management is highly political.  It hurts to see a company division making decisions based upon ""who you know"" vs. the best decision for the business.  If not in ""political favor"" you don't have a viewpoint at all."
bad,"benefits good"
bad,"They have zero care for the employee as an individual, I was lied to and then ultimately fired for a pre existing medical condition.  Management is out to get the employees in order to make a name for themselves."
bad,I was at Duke for 10 years. It's a horrible environment. Stress is the norm. I do not recommend anyone work there. Management is deceptive and the good old boy network is alive and well at Duke.
bad,Given notice prior to Thanksgiving that job was being eliminated and other opportunities would be available.  Received notice Feb 14 of involuntary separation.  Spent 4 months not knowing if there would be a place for me.
bad,Not for people who know how to do things using their minds. Everything is set to a procedure and you are to blindly follow or be punished for straying from the procedure. No engineering is required only the ability to follow the steps and keep up with your administrative duties. Generally mind numbing tedium and boring paperwork to allow the contractors to do the real work and engineering.
bad,"Atmosphere was not good and not conducive to productive work."
bad,"Run, do not walk away from any offers you might encounter here! Very poor and dangerous culture here. Management has a lot to learn about how to treat its pilots!"
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years at the Raleigh call center. They have a attendance goal that is not realistic. If your sick , pregnant or your children is sick they still expect you to come to work. The team leads and supervisors don't like doing there job! The supervisors and team leads constantly talk about employees. Their very unprofessional. When there is storms expect to work 12 hour shifts as well."
bad,"You will not even be considered if you are 50 or over!  They will make up some excuse that other candidates had more qualifications."
bad,Learned a lot about the company and how it functioned the people were very nice to work with and professional.  was hired by a temp agency would have liked to have learned more but the experience was great to learn about scanning and data entry
bad,"Productive and friendly environment. I have learned some new skills such as sitecore and got hands on experience using it. I have been working with couple of managers these during 2 + years,  and got good recognition from both Managers and functional test team lead."
bad,The outsourcing Company was not the most professional. The hours became more and more scarce due to budget issues and the turnover rate is extremely high!
bad,Not impressed with choice in upper management.  Some people get into positions by being a well rounded speaker while exemplifying no competency in the actual job at hand.  I am all for faking it until you make it but only at jobs such as washing lettuce at McDonalds.  Never in the oil and gas industry where you have lives at stake.
bad,"This company is terrible to work for. They fire people for making mistakes that didn't affect anybody in anyway, they are very sneaky and don't keep you informed about anything going on regarding human resource issues."
bad,"Duke Energy was a job.  It was not a career for me.  I learned many professional skills, but was not able to put my talents to good use due to the limited advancement opportunities."
bad,"It groups were rearranged & many 20+ year employees were terminated, some with severance some not. Management consists of ineffectual, incompetent, feckless leaders with no real desire to lead, but only further their careers by appearing effective in front of upper management. $87K was not worth the hassle of being subjected to watching mgt play on their cell phones, cracking jokes while dedicated, overworked employees were struggling in the trenches without support. What a horrible company it has become."
bad,"Duke Energy was a waste of time. No leadership, good ole boy culture....sad. ""Restructuring"" was pending and was in process before my hire date, then my position moved to Cincinnatti 6 months later.....and, yes, I trained my own replacement OVER THE PHONE!!! Very, very, poor management."
bad,"Unfortunately, Duke Energy is not a very well liked company and, as such, working for them, in any capacity, will mark you as public enemy number one; so much so that when we were given free t-shirts with the company logo on them, we were advised to not wear them in public as employees were being targeted.  There are customers that have no issue with the company but the job requirements, generally, do not have you interacting with this customer base.  On average, 86% of all customer interactions are negative.  You will be screamed at.  You will be called names.  Your life will be threatened.  The bottom line is, you must have a very healthy self esteem to work here.  Mandatory overtime is almost constant, especially during the summer.  You can anticipate to work over time, at least every single Monday.  Twelve to fourteen hour shifts, sometimes weeks at a time, are not unheard of during major storm situations.  Metric requirements are generally unreasonable.  You have a scheduled break time but if the current customer interaction you are working on carries over into that break, you are expected to lose your break.  Any attempt to take your break outside of said time is penalized.  In addition to the basic job expectations, there is a minimum sales requirement.  Even though it is not strictly enforced, you will be looked down upon and made to feel less than everyone else as your short-comings are announced to your entire team.  The company is non-union.  A recent attempt to unionize was met with several meetings filled with fear-mongering and no union representation.  Opportunities"
bad,"Engineers are drastically underpaid and under valued here. On average Duke Energy pays engineers 10-15% below the market and would rather pay someone with a lesser degree more than what would it pays an engineer. Make sure you get the best salary offer before you get in, because once you are in there are no actual raises. None."
bad,Duke was Duke.  I big company with lots of contractors who were in and out the door on the regular. My contract was short and I was offered another gig later but turned it down for a better opportunity.
bad,"Would you like to get yelled at, cursed at, hung up on and disrespected all day for no more than $12.25 per hour? If not, then please do not consider working for Duke Energy's customer service department. The worst thing about this job, aside from the stress in this area, was the fact that, if a storm came up or there were too many calls waiting, you could be told two minutes before having to leave that you had to stay 2-8 extra hours to help out. The stress of never knowing when I was going to be able to go home from this horrible job was absolutely miserable. On the plus side, my coworkers were very nice, but management was not great and there were a lot of ridiculous policies. For example, you could not walk around the building or OUTSIDE the building on your cell phone. You must be sitting down because they are so concerned about safety, they think you might run into a wall while talking (not texting, TALKING) on your phone. Excuse me, but when I clock out for the day, and I'm in the parking lot, it is no longer Duke Energy's business if I'm on the phone or not. Bottom line, the benefits were nice when I worked there, but I hear they are doing away with a lot of those now, so there is really no reason to work here because the pay is certainly not good and the stress is unbelievable."
bad,"Learning the taste of job performance of my teammates and the praises they received caused me to reconsider my employment as my production quadrupled my teammates and surpassed those who had been employed with duke several years prior to my employment. There were No full time employees that were diversity candidates and some weren’t considered viable candidates with higher education than those in full time employment "
bad,"Working in commercial nuclear provides numerous, daily examples of why commercial nuclear is going extinct. Management is inept and drastically overpaid. They focus on all of the wrong things, for all of the wrong reasons. It's a great industry, and could have been viable for much longer. It also could have been a nice work environment for employees. But it continues to worsen."
bad,"Alot if animosity, sneakiness, and hostility there. Did not enjoy working there. It only had good Moments, otherwise being in a contract position, you constantly had the threat of being let go, over your head. They do not talk to you, they just let you go. Alot of power tripping going on."
bad,"Very toxic atmosphere. Extremely competitive, and petty people there. Can't trust anyone. Only work here if you are super extroverted, and immune to negative people. I was almost fired for being 3 minutes late."
bad,If you want to work for a company that is 50% temp employees and 50% permanent then this is the company for you.  They never took into consideration their temps.  Was there as a temp for 3 years and thats their limit after that they get rid of you and never got a raise as a temp.
bad,This job is literally a highschool you get a check for going to. This company is full of childish women over the age of 45+. Management in this company is horrible everyone passes the buck and your manager will never have your back nor do they ever admit they are wrong
bad,As a contractor you get treated differently from their core employees. Management does not interact with employees and does not have any management skills.
bad,Worked for a short term contract that ended things at 1 week in due to nothing but completed work on my part.  Generally work was in a open office atmosphere.
bad,"This was one of the most stressful jobs that I have ever had. The utter lack of appreciation, trust and compensation was too much to deal with"
bad,"Duke Energy as a whole is a decent company, but the entry level Customer Service position is not a role I would recommend for anybody. As a customer service representative you see and learn the shady business practices of this company. The company has policies that make life harder for the consumer. Duke Energy over charge people with security deposits, they have a security deposit policy that they do not adhere by. The company doesn't trying their representatives to assist the customer, they train their employees to defend their business practices. Duke Energy has a monopoly in North Carolina, South Carolina and Indiana and they bully people no matter the circumstance. To be the country's largest energy company, their pay is very below average. The call center is very segregated, men and women are separated. There are management and leadership issues with this company, especially in the call center. You are encouraged not to talk to other members on your team and there is a strong possibility that you can be moved to a different team just for becoming friends with your neighbor. Managers are power driven and treat employees as if they are beneath them professionally and personally."
bad,Each day there is something new and you never know what to expect. Working with management is less than desirable but the regular workers are wonderful. They make it bearable to come to work every day.
bad,this is good industry for learn a lots of things that makes us perfect in core mechanical field.
bad,As a customer service rep you not only have customers treating you badly but also the company. You will work whenever they want you to for as long as they want you to.
bad,"Raleigh CCO center is stressful and little to no room for advancement. You are micromanage on everything due to the CCO not meeting service level goals. There isn't a work/life balance, especially if you have children or married. Be prepared.to be flexible with your life than them being flexible with you."
bad,Duke Energy in Cincinnati was an awful place to work as an Office Coordinator. There were no real advancement opportunities. Management was uneducated  and unprofessional.
bad,"Originally worked for Progress for many years. Great workplace, employees had high morale and management was honorable and tried to have good work-life balance. Once merged with Duke the dishonesty from senior management was forced into mid- and front line managers -- or they were fired. Just went through a massive reorganization for the second time in less than 2 years. Leadership has become very poor and likely is due to the nastiness and outright lies that occurred when Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged together several years ago. That same backstabbing behavior seems to have manifested itself within multiple levels of management."
bad,"First off, the plant personnel are great and work hard, however, the corporate managers, directors, and VP's are clueless and unqualified. The endless meetings with never accomplishing anything is enough to drive a working man crazy."
bad,Great place to start. Hard to get into Corporate. Not able to take advantage of the Network process. The selection process of internal promotions stated that they advance based on metrics but that is not the case.
bad,"When I worked for Florida Power Corp. and then after the buy out from Progress Energy, the company was a great place to work and had more work/family value and care for it's employees. When Duke Energy bought out Progress Energy, it immediately stared it's downward spiral. Duke does not care about it's employees, only production and results at any cost. Even if that means your family comes last. Work ridiculous hours, under tremendous stress and the worst upper/senior management group out there. Duke destroyed a great place to work and replaced it with slave drivers with no heart and care about their employees lives."
bad,"The company pays well and has some good benefits , however they do not look out for their employees no matter how great your yearly reviews are. If they restructure or reorganize they will just terminate your employment."
bad,Always busy never any real down time. No real support on the floor. No one ever has the same information. The supervisors always make you feel like your alone
bad,"Management continuously changed and as a contractor there was little to no hope of becoming a full-time employee. The autonomy is nice and it was pretty easy to handle personal business if needed. Management was understanding in that aspect. However, the company relies highly on quantifiable objectives, wanting to utilize numerous programs to measure the same thing over and over again. We spent more time creating unnecessary processes rather tan actually using them."
bad,"A typical day at work of answering phone calls nonstop. some of the people are great work with. There's is a lot of unnecessary ""nit picking' with the job."
bad,"If your looking for a job that has unexpected hours cut during certain times of the year than this is your place! The supervisors are unhelpful, they don't care that you have bills to pay, and they lack of delivering important information to you."
bad,"have taken over progress energy site and have a wrecking ball mentality. Micromanaged business to where all plant decisions come from corporate in charlotte, n.c.."
bad,"I worked for Duke Energy for almost 2 years as a trainer before resigning.  I found the management out of touch and largely unreceptive to their employees.  There was a high turnover because employees were overworked on rotating shifts, and overtime was expected.  This caused a cycle they could not break of under-staffing, since they could not hire and train fast enough to allow employees to have a life/work balance."
bad,Great group of people to work with. Very helpful and great job training. Great if sales is your area of expertise. Great supervisors as well.
bad,You will do fine in this company as long as you are a white male born and raised in the area. If you went to school at Clemson then you'll be much better off. Other than that... good luck if you don't fit that profile.
bad,They don't care about work/life balance or your life outside of work at all.  Management plays favoritism. The pay is decent compared to the other jobs out here but you are expected to work more than what you get paid to do.
bad,A Lot of promotions and opportunities for me but Women not so much. You will do all the work you need to and then some but it doesn't make it better for your opportunities as a women
bad,"not good,,poor management not enough training ...discriminating people good wages poor work environment big name in business but only sub contractors and not permanent jobs"
bad,the culture of people and management was poor everyone expect you to know what to do for customer no one was willing to help. Reps that work there was not professional they did what they wanted to do  and so much personal feeling shown on the floor
bad,"Too corporate and too regulated because its nuclear. Poorly managed. Difficult to get fired, so low performers get promoted into positions when they should not be because people don't want to work with them. Impossible to meet expectations if you work in a critical work group like security, maintenance, or operations."
bad,Stressful work environment 4/10 work week makes it difficult for work/life balance. Few opportunities for advancement outside call center. Salary cap after 5 years of service.
bad,"80% of hiring and advancement are based on who you know, who you are related to and who likes you.."
bad,The manager did not want employees to take lunch breaks wanted you to work through. Also they paid by how many meters you installed and not by the hour.
bad,"Favorite term in this organization is ""intrusive oversight.""  No room to work without constant management interruptions.  Contractors performing work operate in fear - very difficult environment to work under."
bad,"Cut throat company to loyal and dedicated employees.Management does not get around to see there own management team, but rely on feedback from co-workers that in most cases are cut-throat themselves."
bad,"Duke came along and created the 80 plan. You reach a combination of 30 years of service and 50 years in age and they look at how much you are making and cut your job based on what they can save by dismissing you (Terminating). After providing them with 30 years of hard work and loyalty, this is what you are giving, and they play it off like you're nothing. So they let you go with no explanation of why. When you ask what you did wrong, they explain, This is Florida, a right to work state and we do not have to give you a reason other than we no longer need your services.They put you in a taxi and send you home. A very cruel and unjust way to treat loyal employees."
bad,"ok place to work, not much opportunity for advancement, work and life management not very good.  great benefits though and pay.  hardest part to have to work during inclement weather."
bad,"This was a big disappoint for me thinking it was my dream job to go back to commercial. Would not recommend Duke energy for a long term job unless u are from the immediate area of the plant. Supervision is not employee friendly all about production and getting it done, I quit and glad to be out of there."
bad,"Great People.  Growing company.  Need to focus on Talent Management and aligning talent with company strategic plans and goals.   If talent were challenged and placed in appropriate positions, the company would prosper.   Changes occur at the very top and new talent is hired, but middle and upper middle management is not optimized."
bad,If you like the cold than go working for these guys. They don't like outsides they are their own people and don't take kindly to people in the construction business.
bad,A typical day is no direction really. The workplace is undesirable it is like working at a highschool. The women in management act like kindergartners.
bad,"Constant schedule changes and unrealistic metrics but benefits and PTO is great. New management team consists of admin assistants who were made supervisors and owe promotions to upper management. They lead without questioning, grateful for their promotions. During bad weather, OT is mandatory. There is no work/life balance. Competition between teams and individuals is fierce. Eveyone is shown everyone else's stats. This can create resentment and a hostile work environment. I truly believe upper management wants reps to work for a few years then leave. Being a csr is not a career choice anymore. I do not foresee anymore 20 and 30 year csrs."
bad,Good pay but not a good work environment to many people making decisions on how the work need to be preformed and the tool we need when they could not even turn a wrench. I’m glade neither one of my kids want to work here!
bad,"This is a brief and honest review of my personal encounter with the company. Alorica is not a long term job that, in my opinion any employee would last but so long. It is a very unorganized job with very minimum decent supervisors running the show. Equipment is nearly expired and does not allow agents to properly conduct business. . Also, a system issue that did not allow most agents to get paid their worked hours rather an average of three months. This company has a high turnover rate and I only stayed with the company for 2 months. Lack of development and proficiency explains the overall value of Alorica."
bad,when duke bought piedmont natural gas things went downhill. there seem to be alot of confusion. would not let gas side run like it needed to tried to run it like electric company. not good
bad,"Work culture was very oppressive, depressing, and abusive.  Working 12 hours per day for Duke was worse than spending 12 hours in a funeral home."
bad,Duke's Nuclear plants are suffering the same problems as the entire Nuclear Industry. The cost of Nuclear is no longer competitive and management is unwilling and/or unable to make the necessary changes. Blanket reductions in staffing and O&M budget are cutting resources necessary to maintain the plants at a level sufficient to prevent forced outages. This only increases the cost.
bad,The operations side of Duke Energy is very fast paced and requires a great deal of dedication from employees.  The demand on time and resources is high with little relief.
bad,"fast paced, strict time management, your able to work from home,  employees with at least one to two years of experience and excellent performance records are invited to participate as positions become available."
bad,Throughout my 90 days of training i knew duke energy was not the place for me.  After leaving my job of 4 year i felt as if i made the worst mistake. The pay is decent you do get a raise every six month for the first 2 years however the money isn't worth the stress of coming to work and not knowing when you will go home. If you have any life outside of work i sugguest you find other employment.
bad,"For what the metro and national average pay is for credit analysts, the raises are less than a dollar if you're female. Doesn't matter how hard you work."
bad,"Close minded management, poor work culture, and bad vacation package. The majority of the workers are of retiring age and are avidly anti-change. Overall a terrible place to work."
bad,Management provides little effective leadership and suffers from reacting to every little event in an attempt to be politically correct in the eyes of shareholders. Expectations and standards to quality are no longer the driving force of daily operations. Leadership holds no one accountable for important practices and procedures.
bad,"It's a weird Nuclear Cult."
bad,"Pay is no where near the job load, customers call in with requests they can easily do online. Metrics are almost impossible. The job is draining and exhausting."
bad,"The place seems nice in the very beginning, training was okay. This place is literally a non stop call center job , where 80% of the customers are unhappy or upset once the call in . The amount of time they allow for breaks is kinda absurd. Your bathrooms breaks are monitored by the second and count against you , about 50% you need assistance from team leads or supervisors who aren’t around to assist . The summertime at this place you should get paid double for the amount of calls and stress you are put through. Your calls are monitored and graded as if you are a robot. The most important thing is that they don’t pay you what they say. They include bonuses in your salary package as if it’s guaranteed and it’s very difficult to obtaining . Apply if you’re in. Desperate need, but stay away if you can obtain the small"
bad,"I worked at a Duke nuclear power plant.  Stress was the key word for this job.  The work itself was good.  But management was not supportive, indecisive, and ineffectual.  Upper management micromanaged to the nth degree.  Jobs would be removed but work load was almost never cut.  Supervision had a goal of finding a certain number of things wrong every month so they would do observations with this goal in mind.  Minor deviations would be written up as if they were major infractions.  Management, including supervisors, spent much of their time running from meeting to meeting and became seagull management.  I got laid off and realized how stressed I really was.  I would never go back to work there"
bad,"Duke Energy is not consistent with their attendance and corrective action policy. HR will not be supportive with providing documents when they know they are in the wrong. If you challenge your supervisor and stand up for yourself, you will not be supported."
bad,"Micro management and constant re-organization created a lack of vision, strategy, and trust. Not managed like a competitive business. There is no longer a collaborative culture, most work done in silos."
bad,"Poor leadership and management.  A performance culture of getting it done at whatever costs without consideration for repercussions.  Leadership and management not willing to take the time to get a root cause identified, instead just jumping at the first solution that seems feasible.  Leadership lacking in leadership skills, mostly looking back at what they have done in the past and now what is applicable to current situation.  Difficult to perform when different managers and leaders have competing priorities and can't come to an agreement on what strategy to follow."
bad,"Decent benefits, overall a good company, but terrible management.  Claims safety is #1, but always put production over safety.  Has a decent culture, they talk the talk, but don't walk the walk."
bad,"As a security officer at the McGuire Nuclear Power Plant you are constantly under scrutiny and the upper management uses a ""if you don't like it, leave"" approach. You are treated like a 5 year old in that you are not even allowed to lock a pad lock without someone having to check to see that it is locked properly. You're now required to wear over 40 pounds of equipment daily and if you happen to make a mistake you are chastised or possibly even fired. The overall environment is very tense with everyone constantly looking over their shoulder. Management uses spies to get information on other officers and yearly raises are now based on how well you kiss someones butt."
bad,Huge company that treated its employees like numbers.  If you were not the favorite of management they didn't know you existed unless you messed up....
bad,I appreciated my learning experience will working at Duke Energy. The intensive tactical training and safety training enhanced my knowledge and increased my law enforcement and security skills.
bad,I really like this company and would like to retire from here but it seems impossible.
bad,"Be prepared to be 24/7 on call. Mandatory overtime. No life at all. You are going to be sleepy all day and nights. Tired. Stressed."
bad,"The company is undergoing significant transformation - every 6-9 months there's a significant org. change which distracts the entire workforce, disrupting productive work and eroding productivity. Overall, good salary & benefits so it's hard to think about leaving once you're employed."
bad,"8 hour shifts was good but the hours you had to work were terrible , the management wasn’t the best getting holidays and things off was perfect overall"
bad,"I have worked many jobs in my life and this is without a doubt the most demanding and stressful job I have ever had. I was not prepared to deal with customers in the Tampa Bay area. These people are down right demanding, mean, and hateful. Customer service is expected to be empathetic and helpful but do not get the same treatment from management. Overtime is outright criminal as many find themselves working mandatory overtime at 10 to 12 hour days for long stretches of time. For a normal job this would be difficult enough but, having to deal with hostile and angry customers all day long is emotionally taxing and soul draining. Is not a job I would ever intentionally go back to."
bad,"This is a place where they lead you to believe it will be a place to grow and move onward and outside of the call center. This is however not the case. This place has a long training course that show one set of examples and procedures. Only to have different expectations once on the floor. The benefits are a plus if you are not a smoker (includes e-cigs). You do have to prove (quarterly) that you are not a smoker to enjoy the full benefits given. They do have a gym on-site. However, Nobody knows what forms are needed to gain access. The schedules are usually 10 hour days and be prepared to cover for any OT. This not only covers the Midwest but also the Carolinas and Florida where Duke is located. Have fun!"
bad,Company provides great job security. Rotating shift work becomes cumbersome on home and work life.
bad,Good people. Management is out of touch with daily operations and fails to provide needed information to workers. Management by spreadsheet is the norm. Contractors support production goals which enhance the bonuses for regular employees but contractors are not included in these bonuses. No recognition is provided for good performance by contractors.
bad,"work with clients on rectifying corporate card"
bad,"A typical day of work includes taking customer calls non stop. Generally work more than 8hour days."
bad,"Contracted twice..if do't fit in exactly and exceed expectations, don't plan on staying long.  Common practice is everybody knows you are going to be released from contract except teh employee and will be told after gone home for the week."
bad,"This company is very demanding, stressful and competive. The pay is ok but not enough for the mental abuse from customers. I feel in order to advanced it’s based on if people like you not your performance."
bad,This place call center environment and can be fun depending on your supervisor. I did the first and second shift. Both can be challenging but its worth the while.
bad,One culture does not exist.  Some business units provide great opportunities while others are more confining.   Middle management is the most unhappy.  Talent movement is restricted unless you are well connected.
bad,Learn new things everyday. Friendly co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the customer what they need.
bad,"Company very disorganized; procedures are long and continuously out of the way to complete; team leads and management never to be found; "
bad,"This job is relatively soul crushing, dealing with angry customers who complain about everything, and hold you personally responsible for the company's faults. When it gets busy, management expects you to hold on and grind through the day, and is slow in providing employee resources necessary to alleviate stress. If you want to attempt call center life, make sure you're strong of mind don't let people get to you easily."
bad,Duke Energy is a great company with very nice people. The only reason I would look to leave them is simply because I am looking for an opportunity that works better for me financially so that my wife would be able to stay home to care for my children.
good,I have had a lot of family and personal issues whileworking for this company and the company only cares about the customers an not the employess I would not recommend this job for anyone with small kids
good,Starting off at $16/hr now and benefits are good. Advancement slim. Tend to hire family members for quick advancement. Micromanaged at all times. Promotions means sales and is required. Constant mandatory overtime with little warning. Half of the managers aren’t trained and can’t help. If you have a social life forget it. People will sell you out to advance so trust no one. Can possibly work 14+ days straight if there is a storm. Not ideal for single parents with no support group.
good,"You take calls back to back and are only a lotted two 15 minute breaks and a lunch at  whichever time the schedule makers choose. You can not be off the phone outside of your 15 minute break, that will result in ""call avoidance"" and being pointed or written up- even if it's to use the bathroom."
good,"I enjoyed working for the Unix Team, very knowledgeable individuals on the team and I learned alot.  I made a lot of good friends at Duke, but I have really nothing to say about the management which should say alot."
good,"once your schedule has been chosen, it will be the same for the next year to come. I worked 7am-7pm, 6 days out of the week. You have to be on your computer and taking calls AT 7 AM, any later and you're in trouble. Sitting on your butt ALL day, some people may enjoy that, I didn't. The supervisors do not like to help, so you better learn everything you can in the training class or you're going to be SOL! The pay isn't what they advertised either!"
good,Duke energy is Cincinnati is mostly managed by black women which is good and bad. I think they mostly try to hire blacks at this location. One of the black male Supervisors who is still there now drinks alcohol and you can smell it on his breath. They pick and choose who they want.
good,Infighting and competitive company culture  Just wanted to learn but even managers were too threatened to be effective. Us vs Them post merger meant everyone competes with everyone.
good,"If you can't ""totally"" be a company employee, then don't work here. Most people are are very job scared. Loyalty to Duke only because it pays well for the area."
good,"Really depends on your management,  I used to work there and  my manager was great then.  Duke allows many managers to do as they please so it's inconsistent."
good,"If your not in the click, your on your way out. This company does not treat people fairly or honestly. You always feel like you have to look over your shoulder for someone who is watching your every move. There is no trust, even if you have done nothing to promote that untruthfulness. It's a stab in the back kind of outfit if you know what I mean."
good,"Learn a lot of different policies and procedures which are different in every state. Job is entry level and does not pay enough compensation for the work done. Management is always finding ways to pull you into the office to discuss what can improve. Duke is a monopoly and customers cant have a voice. Everything is done by the book and no matter what the circumstance for customers, there is no leniency."
good,"You learn the system to do your job, a typical day at work is running trying to make sure everyone is doing their job correctly, management can use some improvements, what work place culture??, hardest part of the job was making sure everyone knew what they are suppose to do when its 20 plus ppl... Most enjoyable part was my co-workers..."
good,Horrible management.   No room to move up unless you know someone.  You have to kiss butt even if you do know someone. They don’t care about you and your life.
good,"Prior to the merger with Progress Energy, Duke was a great place to work. Since then, however, it has gone downhill in terms of employee morale and job security."
good,Duke Energy is 72% white male and only 2% minority. That is not good and Duke receives a poor rating. The company should put into practice better minority relations.
good,"The project work I worked on was challenging and fun.  I was able to write some interesting and complicated code.  The people at Duke are hard working and dedicated, unfortunately they have too many mid-level managers and not enough people actually doing the work.  Especially in the development house."
good,Company is run by scare tactics. Horrible benefits package. Lowest paid municipality in Florida. Managers would rather have employees scared to do anything wrong than have a relationship with them. Crew moral is extremely low. Crew on other hand is great to work with and make the day enjoyable. Love what I do. Typical day is filled with pole change outs line extensions and replacing underground cable.
good,Overall the experience at Duke was pleasant.  Due to many organizational changes there were many layoffs while I was there.  Including my position.
good,"Absolutely  0 notice for mandatory  overtime, getting cussed out allllll day....Low moral and horrible  pay. When there was bad weather they didn't  care about your family they only care about you being on the phone, management  is horrible and think they're  better and above everyone  else...I just really Hated the job and quit without  another job, that's  how much the job was horrible"
good,"A typical day at work involves monitoring Remedy Picasso consoles, picking up, analyzing and solving user submitted problems and changes. I learned a great deal in my time there, as it is a very high tempo, very high visiblity position within the company. Management was NOT one of the strong points at Duke Energy, and you are treated with almost no respect, and are more like a number in a system than a person. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managements mostly unreasonalbe expectations, and users who do not realize how difficult their requests may be. The most enjoyable part is seeing how your hard work pays off and benefits the end user"
good,"If you do not have patience this is not the job for you. Being cussed out nearly most of your shift by customers. If there is a storm or a lot of outages, it is mandatory to stay as long as you are told to. If youleave during storm mode you will get wrote up."
good,Always worried about getting fired because of supervisors trying to get promoted. Most stressfull job I have ever had.  Probably has taken 10 years off my life.
good,It's a good opportunity. They do work with you on your schedule and give lots of overtime too. Also not hard to move up in the company.  It's fine that you don't have customer service because they train you with classes.
good,"Management is awful and sneaky. A lot of drama and talking about other employees with employees. Unprofessional. I feel like they do the bare minimum to keep you going. The company itself does just enough to make you want to stay even though the job is horrible. Extremely micromanaged like no other, constantly on your back about minimal things. You’re constantly busy and when there is a rare opportunity to have a small break between calls management is once again on your neck about something you can’t even control. Zero empathy. Almost impossible to use PTO unless you request months in advance. There was a time my grandmother was sick and needed my help, simply leaving early one afternoon was a major inconvenience. Mind you, it was mid week-not a busy day and my supervisor wouldn’t let me use PTO. Co workers are racist to the point that it’s disturbing. Not being from the area, you just have to sit there uncomfortably and control your mouth. They also expect you to get to work early and check work orders before clocking in. They don’t give you even 5 minutes a day to complete work orders or make call backs. It’s very rare for a supervisor to call in a segment unless it’s for technical difficulties and even then it’s a huge inconvenience even if it’s out of your control. Bottom line...I can say well over a handful of cons about this place and not many positive things."
good,Military driven with High Stress levels. Meetings all the time. Less time in the field to  make a difference. Disconnect from corporate office to site.  More worried about perceptions. Not understanding work force.
good,"Just went through a massive reorganization for the second time in less than 2 years. The most recent one occurred during the end of November, 2018 with massive layoffs, severance packages, etc.. Leadership has become very poor and likely is due to the nastiness that occurred when Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged together several years ago. That same backstabbing behavior seems to have manifested itself within multiple levels of management. The Nuclear Energy industry is shrinking. Additionally, it appears we have leadership within the White House that does not fully support producing clean energy. Therefore, the Nuclear Energy industry is not a place to be in at this time. Best to look elsewhere."
good,"they talk about diversity but do not follow up. there are departments that do not have a single minority in them. if you move up in a department,generally you have to move to another department to become management."
good,"The culture of the company is good but the compensation doesn't reflect the cost of living nor does it match the the job."
good,"I was a contractor on the Transmission side, I received notice that the contract was not going to be renewed when I got an email stating my badge had been suspended."
good,"my day starts at 7am...I have learned the collection, credit and legal laws and regulations...workplace culture has been hectic and now stressful due to outsourcing our jobs...explaining to customers why they owe the bill...working with legal accounts"
good,Great company with mandatory overtime but lack of pay. Love the environment and would definitely recommend to a qualified individual. Decline to add additional information online.
good,I was a contractor though.  Not treated like you would be as an employee.  They control your life outside of work too and call it Safety.  Creepy.  These large companies are very complex and have many issues that fall on the little peoples shoulders.
good,You have to be very flexible and available for anything. On the phone and sitting majority of the day. Have to be on call during storms and any bad weather.
good,"Took a full time position with significant pay cut because of potential opportunities.  After hired management changed, opportunities lost, they forgot and didn't care about why i was hired.  did not want me working with what i was hired for and gave it to under experienced people.  if you just want a job and you don't really care about your work then this is the place for you."
good,Good place to start an entry level RP position. The commercial business is not as rewarding of fun as the DOE. The area is small and not much to do here.
good,Duke fails to recognize the impact of job shuffling on its employees. Work Life balance is a phrase used to enhance the corporate image but is not actually practiced. Heavy dependence on contract workers even for vital positions.
good,"Gone are the good old days of utility working here. Duke is a strictly corporate company with no other goal then to line the pockets of executives and politicians who support them. Pension is gone, good healthcare is gone, and if they go thru a reorg, no one is safe."
good,call after call will come in and you barely get a break ? I would not recommend this job because too mant rules and the people complain about anything
good,"Duke Energy is a great company to work for. Typical benefits, average salary. There are opportunities to advance if you're an engineer. The workplace culture was kind of toxic."
good,I’ve been here over 5 years and it’s always something new  changes are communicated after the fact and sometime are life changing. If you have no kids and want no life then this is the place for you
good,Mandatory OT because they don't staff well. Too many calls and no relief in sight. No real help or assistance. Stressed when I leave the call center. Constant calls and complaints about Duke and high bills. Customers are very aggressive with Duke Energy and if you need a moderate level of stress this is not the job for you.
good,Duke Energy is a good company to work for. It does lack in some benefits that today's employees need. Overall pay and medical benefits are good. Employees that work here are some of the best ever.
good,Until restructuring. Under current upper management a run to failure business model is being applied. This hurts consumers of Dukes power generation and their employees.
good,"we provide the customer service for electric service in North Carolina, the customers that we deal with more often than not require a break down of everything on bill, how billing works, payment history, required documentations, connection and disconnections of service, deferred payment arrangements, etc.....  Along with all of these things we do for the client we get called many things that are not very respectable and it really is not worth what we are paid in my or many of my co-worker opions"
good,Learned a lot about logistics and warehousing. The hardest part about working at Duke Energy was dealing with the hostility between management and union employees.
good,"Typically, people who call their utility company are doing so out of anger and frustration. Complicated billing issues take time to go over on a telephone call, but call length is highly scrutinized. There are a lot of chiefs."
good,Lots of overtime. Short staffed. Outages are brutal. Long hours during outages and no time off until outage is over. have worked as many as 30 days (12.5 hrs a day) straight without time off. Unproductive workers never forced to do their job.
good,Guidelines were changed daily. It was hard to know if you were doing your job correctly because things changed everyday nearly. The people making the changes barely understood the job completely.
good,Employees are great to work with and I have many good friendships built throughout the years. Good work conditions and management provides an excellent direction for success of teams and corporation.
good,"The IT Department is the best place to work within the business.  The Business side thinks that they can do our work better than we can.  Also, being a contractor is probably better than being an employee because you do not have to deal with the bureaucracy and politics associated with being a full-time employee."
good,I Really would not like to say anything abou this company on here because i am still employed by them. But not everything is good there nor is it bad. I will be glade to tell who ever mite hire me in the furture all about this place.
good,Everyday was different.Management was all ways changing due to being contracted out by different companies.Great co-workers.When u had to walk steep hills of Tega Cay.The end of the week.
good,"-Increased sales 15% in 7 months  		"
good,"No commitment to long term contractors, feel like an outsider even after being there 5 years"
good,There are long hours and a bad work schedule. Communication with management is difficult. There is forced overtime frequently and it is difficult to get days off.
good,Company is very good to work for. The benefits are good and amount of time off work is good. Constant changeover and new employees. Very professional in their approach with new employees .
good,"If you are not a perm-employloyee you are considered disposable.  They will promise you the moon and deliver nothing.  Benefits for perm-employees abound, but contractors aren't even invited to events like catered thanksgiving meals or mass internal training.  It can be done, but it takes a lot of begging."
good,At this job what they tell you on the interview is the truth about the expectations. When they tell you what is expected of you pleass listen it is not an exaggeration
good,"I Worked Monday through Friday usually.10 hour work days.Customer Service Representative in Billing Department."
good,"Job security... for the most part."
good,"You can work as much overtime as you want to.  The pay is great, you get quarterly incentives and yearly incentives.  You have the opportunity to get a raise every quarter based on your performance.  Overall, their benefits are great!"
good,"Working at Duke, You have to understand that you are ON CALL, meaning if they call you on a Saturday or Sunday you have to show up. If they call you on your off day, you have to go in. Overtime is never optional and they will call overtime 5 before your shift ends and as early as 1 to 2 hours before your shift starts."
good,"Maintained daily logs."
good,As EGS the company paid vacations and holidays. The company was sold to Alorica and the company paid very little vacation time and  no holidays at all. People left because we had to take the holidays off and never got paid. the people got short pay days and had a hard time paying there bills. If there was a hurricane or storm hit in different locations it was mandatory to pull 12 hours shifts even if you had small children. the managers started walking out because of not getting fair  treatment  The company then put untrained people from off the floor to manage the other associates. It did not work well.
good,"Great company, most positions are not FTE, but are contract for long periods of time. Would recommend as a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Continuous improvement is preached but not really championed.  safety first is the mantra and i firmly believe that everyone buys into those concepts and practices.
good,"This was a great company to work for. But there was a lot of stress on a daily basis. There was never anything to promote a better environment, and it was a demanding job."
good,Cracked nuclear reactors and no time for training.  I was only on the job for like six weeks before they tried to get me to lie about a crack in the hpi nozzle of the Oconee nuclear station.  Total freak show. No training and old infrastructure.
good,"12 hour work day glued to computer. No scheduled breaks, none. No lunch time, You have to eat at your desk, Not allowed to leave work location to go pick up lunch for yourself or for the group. On call for a week, with no compensation unless you are called into work. Swing shift, for those who don't know that term, you work 1st one week, and 3rd the next, then maybe 1st shift again, then 2nd shift, then 3rd shift. Your family will love planning things around your swing shift. Your body will, too."
good,"The review pertains to the client, Duke Energy. "
good,"Great place to work, but stressful job, no one wants to work as a ""Team Player"" to achieve goals unless under stress! You are also not treated like a part of the ""team"" as a contractor!"
good,Very established and safety oriented company. A lot of experienced individuals with years of experienced.
good,It was a good place to work contingent about the project you are on and your management.  As per any job management can make or break a group.  I happened to have a bipolar manager so it was weird some days.  he would show favor to certain employees and he was borderline inappropriate and made inappropriate comments
good,There are different cultures for each site. Florida could definitely be more diverse.  The culture at some of the Florida locations is definetly behind the times.
good,Need to recognize the ones saving that place . 40 yes of service should get you more than a leaf blower.a desk won't run but so much on a job. Save them millions but  don't be late
good,A productive place to work. Great place to learn about using IT in a large energy company. There are offices all around the South East so relocating isn't too hard.
good,"VERY POOR SUPERVISION, Management late for meetings disorganized on projects, could not make decisions on projects, lots of waisted time in meetings and on EPC projects."
good,Great place to build a career. Must like extended hours as it is the electric company and when storms come through you will have to assist with outages.
good,Great industry to work in but over time the industry is changing and becoming more challenging. Competitive salaries across the board but additional burdens and load become a way of life over the course if time.
good,"Between phone work, inspections, handling, 7 different calls segments based on my skill level, reaching out to customers and the county for further information"
good,"It's a great place to work because of the bonuses and pay."
good,"Good ol boy redneck mentality. Nepotism is rampant. Friends and family override job skills and experience."
good,"a typical or normal work day is early morning meeting, followed by work of the day and if any issues, a evening meeting to discuss impediments for resolution."
good,"I worked at Duke as a contract sw developer.    I was offered a full time position but declined as I intended to leave the area.    When I did move away they asked me to work remote which I did for almost 2 years.     Working remote is convenient but not healthy so eventually I looked for a got a local job in Portland, OR instead."
good,"Think it over before applying here. You are told sales isnt part of your job but it is. If you arent a big seller of the additional products they offer you are not going to get anywhere in the company anytime soon. You are required to work a LOT of over time, you get extended with only a few hours notice, meaning if there are storms or bad weather in any of the states they cover you WILL have to work OT. During storm mode you are required to work 12 hr days maybe 7 days in a row! Not everyone is trained to handle the outage calls  so if you are trained you will be taking more calls than other reps which isnt fair. They do offer great benefits such as vacation & hgelathcare form day one, the pay is decent, however, you have to weigh that against the amount of hours you will HAVE to work and have a thick skin, once the customers call during outages you WILL be cursed out and treated like garbage by the cusomters, HIGHLY stressful job. really think it over"
good,The company was good as part of FPL. It has gotten much worse as part of money-grubbing Duke. They wasted millions of government grant dollars putting in a Telvent SCADA only to turn around and take it out and put back in a GE (previously Alstom) System.
good,"Lots of hours worked, well compensated. Lots of cyber security experience gained. Management was very supportive and helpful in getting the job completed."
good,its a decent job for a person with no kids and minimum bills. The hours are OK but in order to advance you must have 90 or better quality and meet attendance
good,"Pay rate is horrible, the Supervisors is in competition for sales, they want you to lie to the customers about their bill and getting sales. Basically telling you to do what you have to do.The building need a whole new look, The CEO is awesome, he’s very understanding and a great leader for the company. The Company requiring too much for 9$, we have families, we need health insurance. Duke Energy you got to do better for your employees!! Clean up!!"
good,I was part of the weatherization aspect. I was able to work with people everyday and I loved it. I also loved installing the product in the customers home.
good,"If there was better management, I probably wouldn't have left. No real room for advancement in the department I worked in (Security). My Co-workers were a really good group of people, I still keep in touch with a few of them."
good,Duke Energy is safety focused in everything they do.  There is a focus on the customer and communities in which Duke Energy serves.  They care about the environment and the future.
good,Company is great... working in the call center is very stressful... you maybe called in to work at a moment notice.... pay is great... if you love money... have no kids and no life and a lot of patience.. it could be the job for you.
good,"I enjoyed over 5 years with this company (though 3 of those working from home), and always had work to do. I say that as a good thing! Break room also had plenty of delicious options."
good,"Duke granted me several opportunities to develop different skills based on a diverse job assignments throughout me career.  "
good,It's a typical Fortune 500 company. Very hesitant on new ideas. Not very open to innovation or transparency. Employee culture is not open to change. If you do not live in Charlotte or Raleigh then forget about getting a job outside of line technicians and engineering. They do not actively use remote technology.
good,dispatcher consumer order worker to different areas around Indiana to turn and off power. create meter changes and also create order to remove meter after theft.
good,Good people to work with but always waiting on a layoff. No new hires just temp workers hired. Upper management not connected with average workers.
good,It's a good company to work for. I was a co-op with the various power delivery groups so there's no typical day to describe. I loved working in power and designing substations. The hardest part of the job was the time crunch everyone was under. The best part is going out into the field and seeing  your work being built.
good,"I am not bitter, but after busting my butt for six years, having a great attitude, going above and beyond - no promotion, no chance of advancing to another career."
good,"Worked at the Catawba site. Duke takes great effort to over analyze everything it does. We had a saying there, As soon as you walked in you may as well write your self up for a violation. It was always 2 steps forward and 1 step back."
good,"A typical day at work, I take inbound calls from customers who have questions and concerns regarding their electric bills, setting up new services, transfering and ending existing services. I also fill in as a team lead to assist with escalated calls and assisting representatives with questions. I enjoy assisting customers and resolving their issues. I also enjoy working with my coworkers, they make the job easier as well. Management is very inconsistent. One manager may do a process one way, whereas another manager will take the same situation and do it totally different. The job isn't very family friendly or family oriented within the call center. The call center has a different set of rules and policies than the rest of the company, even though its not outlined on the company's employee website."
good,"A typical day at work is talking and resolving customer's issues. Depending on the weather, it can be very busy with power outages and power lines down. I learned that you have to be very cautious when it comes to reporting electric problems and gas issues. It can be a matter of life and death if not reported correctly. The mangement is helpful to the employees and always there for support. The hardest part of the job would be trying to explain to customers that we are trying our very best to get their issues resolved and the power back on. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have helped a customer and they are satisfied with how I have assisted them."
good,"I worked on the Piedmont side of Duke Energy but also worked closely with a lot of people on the Duke Energy side.  On the Piedmont Natural gas side I had the flexibility to work from home a couple of days a week and also set my own hours.  The leadership at Piedmont Natural Gas trusted me to do my job and therefore I was empowered to do so."
good,"Duke Energy robs contractors by not hiring them as permanent employees. Contractors do the same work as fulltime employees. They pay low, non-competitive salaries."
good,It was ok the job was easy i cleaned 2-3 floors every night made sure i did my job as told didn't have any distractions i came to work on time i came to work everyday
good,"Good place to work.....But no road map of the projects."
good,"I honestly cannot say anything about duke energy, I was a contact worker for duke energy.  Duke seems to be a great company with great benefits.  Many different staffing companies provide staff for duke."
good,possibly sometime in the future I will provide my feedback to help give an accurate idea of the job environment....for now not applicable...future date
good,This was a contract job that I obtained through a Temp Service. I personally did not like some of the trainers as some of them appeared to have had their favorites and it was a lot of work to grasp in such a short period of time.
good,Decent place to work with good working hours . Management was pretty fair and they offered overtime. They offered uniforms and safety shoes. Every year you got money for new uniforms
good,"I was a contractor, not an employee.  It would not be appropriate for me to review or comment on my time at Duke Energy as I was not eligible for any of their employee benefits."
good,"Typical day = 8 to 9 hrs."
good,Duke is good but big and slow to change.  I was on the support team and liked the people.  I would work there again.  They are strong money makers.  Thanks.
good,"With the fossil fuels part of the business, they are feeling the pressure of renewable energy and cheap natural gas from several competitors so they are cutting a lot of their numbers."
good,"Walking around all day through peoples yards to read their electric meter and put in the numbers on the device giving to you. Some people have mean dogs, some people have their fences locked so you cant get in. It was commission based pay when I was working there so you didn't have time to stick around because cut off time was at 5Pm"
good,"Duke is under a lot of financial pressure as most big utilities are.  The public utilities commissions have created a very perverse incentive in which the worst thing the utility can have is a well-run power plant that needs no capital investment in upgrades.  It creates an income stream that management cannot use because they get paid for return on capital, nothing for O&M.  As a result, the only way to improve profitability is to lay off employees, so that is what Duke is doing, in a BIG way.  In the long run, it will damage the company, but I'm sure that the senior management would reply that there is no long run unless the company can stay alive and profitable through the short run."
good,"Overall - it was a good contract position. The folks I worked with were down to earth, caring, & hard working folks. In both groups that I supported.."
good,"good company, pay could be better, they need to give more paid days off. they also let you get very few sick days off. the managers tend to micro manage"
good,I was only a contractor for less that 6 months so I was not there to really know the structure of the company.  If I had the opportunity that I could give feedback.
good,The pipeline group was a great place to work. People were concerned with the assets. People enjoyed their  work. Without hesitation I would recommend working at the company.
good,"my work was interesting but I was limited since I was there as a contract engineer."
good,lots of hours but low end on pay scale. i like it was close to home. lots of parking space. very secure and safety is a priority. Clean and always having food .
good,Company is in the news a lot.  A person must make their own decisions about Duke if you need a job. Duke usually try to weed people out.  The process of being hired on permanently is very stressful.
good,Day is very regimented with little area for advancement.  Morale is very low. Great pay and decent benefits.  The 401-K is decent and there is plenty of overtime.  There is some mandatory overtime.
good,Driving for 8 hours a day. Fast paced and not the job for everyone. This is a contract position and the low bid is the winner. Some may like this type of work but it was not edifying for me.
good,The staff was reasonably responsive to HR and employee customer service needs.  Payment was timely and benefits were administered competently.  They are a good company to work as a W2 employee through.
good,Large top down company. 
good,"The calls start coming in as soon as you clock in and put you status as available. Answered any inquires the client had about their account and their balances as well as updated accounts if there were any equipment changes. Handled credit/debit card transactions, helped customers create new accounts by wither transferring services to a new address or creating a entirely new account, assisted in requests to close account as well as communicated with programs that assisted customers who had an outstanding balance or those with a low income, to try to enroll the customers them."
good,All bets are off when management changes.  New managers do not look at current skills of employees or even their resumes.  Group i am in currently is scattering to find jobs out side of the team and Duke because of it.  it is chaos among the ranks right now.
good,"It's a good job with ok benefits but advancement is hard unless you know someone who is willing to help you move up. There are a lot of politics and it is easy for a person to get ""pigeon holed"" in a position. Working in a power plant has its advantages and disadvantages but the good thing is that there is a family environment created due to the long hours spent working. The work is hard and the environment is hot and dirty, but good teammates help the day or night go by more quickly and easily. Safety is a high priority at the company and this culture is driven from day one of employment."
good,"Typically, as a Customer Care Telephone Agent, it can be very stressful to fulfill the expectations for Average Handle Time for each call and provide excellent Customer Service.  Time management was a must in that atmosphere.  The hardest part of the job, was not being able to make every customer's experience a pleasant one if there were issues with billing, power outages and/or service."
good,Lots of un-necessary politics and poor moral among the craft. As a manager one of my unwritten tasks was to try to keep the craft personnel inspired by keeping a positive attitude.
good,typical day i dealt with customers wishing to start or cancel services. I also dealt with a lot of irate customers who were subject to disconnection. most agents were unhappy and treated customers badly the pay was low compared to other duke energy locations which was like a 3 to 6 dollar difference
good,Working for duke is an easy place to work there are good managers and also they are easygoing.The thing that i do not like about this job would be the fact that it can sometimes be slow.
good,"Duke Energy is the largest electric energy provider in the world with over $54 billion in annual revenue.  With over 250,000 miles of electrical lines that must all be protected."
good,"I start work the minute I get there, always something to do.  I'm "
good,The company has a long history of promoting from within which enabled me to move into multiple roles each time gaining new skills and experiences.
good,"Working for a Utility Company is unlike working for any other industry I have ever experienced. It is definitely a challenge."
good,Good place to work. I have enjoyed the experience. Great group of people. I would recommend this place to anyone. Nice safe work enviroment
good,good benefits if you can deal with all the micro managing and politics and ridiculous safety rules. other than that the benefits are great in the money is good
good,"Duke is a typical large company. Good benefits and decent pay. If you are liked by someone higher up and they will ""sponsor"" you, the sky is the limit."
good,"This place is decent pay for the pleasure of waiting for someone old and under-qualified to die to get ahead."
good,talking to customer daily on the phone about their electric services and what additional services offered by Duke energy.  Dusk is a company that is too large and is out of touch with its customers and employees.
good,"This was a very fast paced, high volume call center.  Busy days could see over a hundred calls in an 8 hour time period.  The best part was the benefits as they were some of the best I've ever encountered."
good,This is a good place to work. No growth potential and has very unorganized management. It's good for people either just starting in this type of business or people 55 and older.
good,"I took inbound calls to start stop service, send out techs for power outages, poles down, assistance with gas leaks, etc, and made sure the fire dept and police were made aware of dangerous situations. I made payment arrangements and worked with companies the assisted customers with bill payment. During power outages we had to work overtime, sometimes having to stay overnight in nearby hotels to assist but were always provided meals and hotels were paid by the company."
good,"Answer calls on new acts, service calls and billing payments"
good,Duke Energy acquired Progress Energy this year to become the largest utility in the United States. 
good,"As stated, the company monetarily compensates properly however, management does not properly control instances of conflict of interest resulting in improper information control between organizations and leverage for personal gain."
good,"The merger between Progress Energy and Duke Energy is still taking place. The future of employees is still unknown, along with location, and job requirements."
good,Inbound call center assisting customer with begin and end service requests. Billing inquiries
good,"Had the opportunity to work with more than a dozen Engineers and learn Engineering, as well as, Computer Technology, Network Operations, and Security Administration."
good,Hard to advance if under new contract. The union only represents you for benefits.
good,"Company is not interested in capabilities"
good,"Duke Energy is a great place to work because of its people and their commitment to provide customers with the reliable, low cost electricity, day in and day out."
good,"Was okay place to work, They do not give you chances when an issue comes up, not really far on listening to employees... Benefits and pay are awesome..."
good,"I left not long after Duke Energy and Progress merged, and I know the culture has changed a bit from what I understand. Over all, though, I did enjoy my time there."
good,This is a great company investing in cutting edge technology for installation engineers and emergency response engineers. Developed new backend systems  for will allow the solution to work at scale.
good,"Primarily, time was spent performing the monthly/quarterly work.  The work results were used by various internal departments and external vendors.  Work was demanding and under time constraints, so time management skills were very important.  Each employee was assigned their own tasks, which many times affected another's workload.  You had to be able to work well with others, both those that you shared a department with and those in various other departments within the corporation.  There was a lot of interaction with third parties outside of the organization. "
good,Duke Energy has pretty good insurance and benefits.  I found the opportunities for advancement to be limited and the pay wasn't in line with most other call centers.  I did like my supervisors and co-workers very  much however.
good,"Great opportunity for younger, hungrier people. After 22+ years of a rotating day/night, weekday/weekend, 12+ hr days schedule, I was fortunate enough to be financially able to retire early. At 53 years old, I was getting burned out!"
good,Our crew was consistently having problems due to either lack of communication from our higher ups or an unorganized work plan. It was very frustrating.
good,"Started off as a glass collector. Went on to be part of the bar staff. I then started to learn a bit more about the business, Long hours with late nights."
good,"acted as liaison between business users and IT personnel to translate user needs into IT application development terminology for developers"
good,"Duke Energy provides a competitive benefits package and salary.  I went to work for this company originally when it was Carolina Power & Light and then Progress Energy.  This company was then merged with Duke Energy.  I enjoy a challenging job and require minimum supervision.  I have worked in many departments over my years at this company.  I have acquired many skills and met and worked with very intelligent and hard working co-workers.  While some aspects of my day were repetitive, I was challenged by the requests of my customers on a daily basis.  The nuclear industry is a very procedure and regulation oriented environment and can be quite stressful but also a constant challenge to learn and grow."
good,Be prepared to take on average 100 calls per day.  You must be able to learn new information quickly and understand that some policies may change from day to day. You must have thick skin and be willing to be belittled and listen to angry customers at least 70% of your day. This is a great job for single people with no children.
good,"- 2 unit, boiling water reactor"
good,"Every day brings a new challenge which makes it difficult to plan and execute your day and be productive.  The workforce is very experienced; howvever, it is difficult to utilize this experence due to conflicting priorities."
good,"My review of Duke Energy is very limited due to exposure only to the call center environment, which is unlike any other group within the company, in that it is extremely micromanaged. A good team and a good manager goes a long way in this type of environment, and I was lucky to be on a good team my first year of employment. I learned a lot from seasoned teammates and my former boss, who fortunately for us, was knowledgable of the job, sensitive to our concerns, approachable and understood a good work/family balance. I would have remained on her team if I had not moved from second and/or third shift, to first shift."
good,A typical work day would be Fast Pace production. Loading coal and ash to be spread out and cover with lime every foot in a half to two feet lay out. Then when dried out track back and load up the dry material to be put in the land fill.
good,will work you to death mandatory shifts and spare of the  moment. Must be ready to work and work over at any given time will fire you if you make a mistake on a gas call
good,Duke Energy's culture is evolving and a new workforce is entering their environment. They recognize the need to adapt and change. Kudos to their major Agile transformation journey. Truly enjoyed working with employees and management!
good,"Calls are monitored so we have to be professional.  Calls are also timed, so the faster you are solving customer issues or fixing account issues, the better opportunity you have to advance over anyone else."
good,"Good company, nice people. In general very little to complain about, they take good care of their employees, and offer good benefits for the ""in-house"" work force."
good,"Duke likely has too many meetings; some necessary, some not. Very good benefits, very good work-life balance. Management does not seem to have a good grasp of how to be successful. $26,000,000/yr for the CEO?"
good,This job would be great for people who love to work a lot of hours. It is just to stressful of a job for me because you are dealing with people power.
good,"Duke is a great company that is growing and going through many changes for the better. Work hours in some departments can be stressful, but overall not a bad company to work for."
good,"I loved working at DEP. The managers are great and the team leads are AMAZING. The down sides of working for the company is : they have no work life balance, work will ALWAYS need to come first. They do give you sick time  but it DOES count against you. They DEMAND sales out of you even when it was NOT in the job description. Managers get to come and go as pleased and take unlimited bathroom breaks but they provide you with 2 breaks and a lunch break and if you have to go to the bathroom frequently it will start to count against you. Every job has its pros and cons but if you have small children i DO  NOT recommend working for DUKE"
good,I work with a great bunch and have no complaints. The culture of our department is more relaxed and very productive. This may not be true for every department but for the most part DE employs great people.
good,"Management training is needed. Declining talent in senior leadership. Promotions, opportunities and advancement inconsistent with talent and skills. Lack of understanding at senior levels of operational business"
good,"The best thing about Duke Energy is the benefits package, other than that like any other corporation in America there number one priority is capital. I have been with the company five years during this time our union contract has been negotiated twice, we have had two TSP's, they continue to reduce salary, while not back filling vacant positions creating more work for less pay. The company does not make is employees nor it's customers a priority."
good,"When working at Duke Energy, I started as a contractor and was later onboarded as FTE. The benefits for FTEs were unparalleled - great medical, dental, vision, and retirement savings plans."
good,"Answer 100+ calls a day for customers calling in about billing inquires, gas & electric emegencies, getting extensions on their bills. The hardest part of the job is not being able to solve all of the customers request. We have to meet the needs of our customers without causing the company any monetary loss and sometimes they feel that we don't care. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers I am really close to."
good,"Duke Energy has changed some for good some not. There is a push to be the biggest and to be on the cutting edge in the utilities industry,"
good,"Other than a few issues within management I find that overall the experience with the company has been good. There are people willing to work with you and help you advance. However, you have to find who those people are. Once you get into the company there is room for advancement that can be taken advantage of. However, it can sometimes feel based off of who you know"
good,"I was WAY overqualified for the position I had which made it extremely boring and there was a very clique-ish culture in the department.  The staff “manager” showed obvious favoritism toward certain individuals.  If it wasn’t for those things, I’d still be working there."
good,"Typical day consisted of running and analyzing reports and energy usage. I learned a lot about how energy is used, moves, stored, and transferred. I learned about the importance nd   functionality of the power grid and the urgent need to develop new sources of energy. Management is laser sharp, however there is little room for creativity, or mistakes because lives depend on accuracy. At any point your mistake can cost somebody their life, especially in the transmission of power on the grid. The culture is highly compartmentalized so there was little opportunity to experience the rewards that come with diversity. The hardest part of the job was limited opportunities for women,rigor and redundancy. Strangely enough there is a log of redundancy but it is not a static business.I liked the benefits package and it paid well. I also appreciated the stand they take on work life balance. An employee with a skewed work life balance makes mistakes, and mistakes can cost somebody their life."
good,A typical day is slow pace. The hardest part about the job is family/ job balance in my opinion. Also it is hard to have consistent attendance at your local church. They pay very well and Benefits are wonderful.
good,"the management hierarchy was convoluted. too many people to potentially answer to. parking was a partially paid for. good vacation allotments, dependent care allotments, and vacation allotments. good pay, but a cube farm, which in and of itself is stressful. free coffee. LOTS OF SAFETY MEETINGS AND ONLINE CAREER BUILDING WORKSHOPS."
good,A typical day varies in the customer call center. Great place to grow and learn.The hardest part of the job was on call hours. You are always on call no matter what they say when you are hired.
good,Due to the rotating schedules and long hrs it is hard to find a balance in lie especially with a family. On the other hand its the best paying job that doesn't require a degree.
good,"It was a typical call center setting.  We were seated in personal and shared cubicles that contained our own computer station and telephone.  We answered inbound calls from customers who had questions about their billing, wanted help in understanding their billing or just wanted to disconnect, connect or transfer their electric services.  I learned how to be a more patient and understanding person when it came to dealing with the public.  I learned the basics of office works, i.e. copier, fax, filing, Microsoft, typing, etc.  My co-workers were all phenomenal people and we helped each other make it through the difficult type of customer calls.  The hardest part of the job was having to take so many ""bad"" calls, or complaints about the company, being called everything but our names and just having to grin and bear it so-to-speak, but we all pushed through it and we persevered.  Also having to work or go into work during inclement weather on dangerous road conditions, was not very enjoyable either.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were allowed ""offline"" or off the phone time to do more clerical work, and also the pay was enjoyable as well and benefits that the company offered."
good,Customers can be very rude and there's a lot of mandatory overtime with short notice
good,A typical day at work consists of answering phone and helping customers with different types of problems. I have learned how to handle different situations including life threating situations. Management tries to help with whatever is needed. The hardest part of my job is sitting for 12 hrs straight and only being able to have 30 min break. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and finding a solution to their problem.
good,"Reorganizations annually with placements, position and assigned work changing more often. Somewhat stressful environment and lacks consistency. Must be very flexible and able to learn new projects quickly."
good,"Thinking of utilities, most people expect Duke Energy to be very traditional. But, I was pleasantly surprised to learn all the technology (IoT, Smart Thermostat, Electric Cars, etc.) work that the company does."
good,"Job is secure, and co-workers are wonderful. Pace is a little slow for someone used to being in the field and negotiating more. Great benefits and lots of paid time off for good work/life balance."
good,"A lot of multi-tasking."
good,"Answer incoming calls from customers and give any and all information about their bills, rates, disputes on bills, etc. Management were nice people. All co-workers were very friendly and family oriented. The hardest part of the job was trying to explain to customers that our bills were correct and they did have to pay the amount on the bill. The most enjoyable part of the job was the office atmosphere."
good,It was a great learning with Duke. As there where less heirerchy level... the flow of information was good and good work culture indeed.
good,"They have monthly and weekly activities that make the job fun and never feel like work, you feel like one big family. Great company and workplace. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"I was an contractor employee. Auditing invoicing.I they have a there contractor  employee works for year without benefits, It hard to become a full-time employee with Duke."
good,"When issues arose between sections the manager stepped in and resolved the issue promptly. Worked to schedule and was supported in accomplishing it. When time off was requested, management approved it without any issues."
good,Good working condition lot of good people and willing to help you with your job and if you don't know how to do a job there are plenty of people to help you
good,My co-workers are very smart working people and i also learned from that.i must say i enjoyed working with this company.
good,"1) Always ready for new activities & certification"
good,CEO is driving the company in the ditch. Only focused on profits. Huge layoffs in Nuckesr putting the plants at risk. All the older employees being driven out because their benefits cost more.
good,Devlope Electrical drawings per Engineer work scope. Management doesn't get involved unless they get pressured. Hardest part is keeping all the different projects sorted per engineers preferences.
good,"The duke is a wonderful and enjoyable work place specially for learning new things such as, co,operating with new staffs, working with people from different background."
good,Poor Management but the workers are great.  Pay is good but contractor's are completely taken advantage of.  Duke is treating contractors just like employees without giving them any benefits.  Disgusting.
good,Nice place to work. Very professional atmosphere. I enjoyed working for Duke Energy during the time that I spent there. Breaks are (2) breaks throughout the day 15 min. Pay was fair and the training was fair.
good,"Great company, and the staff were good trainers. High turnover rate due to angry customer calls. More training on how to handle those type of calls would be better."
good,Only gave four stars because of my personal experience with two kind hearted floor leads. BUT I'm ok with being honest with the fact its stressful ranging from 1-5 ; 4 daily lassing or failing.
good,"friendly people; safety is priority; hard to get a permanent position; co-workers became like a family; entered employee time sheets weekly, then processed invoices for the remaining time"
good,"It was an environment where new ideas are not well received. They area I was in, were not into innovation. If the idea can from someone much older than myself, then it was well received!"
good,It was okay people and enviroment. They dont really work with you they just schedule you for a ton of hours and dont care about your personal life to give you days off.
good,"Working at Duke Energy has been and will continue to be a privilege.  It has provided a great living for myself and my family.  As of 2019 Duke Energy security officers switched to a rotating schedule moving from night shift work to day shift work and vice-versa, with VERY little turn around time, sometimes only 1 day.  This is EXTREMELY difficult on the body and mind and provides a terrible work/life balance.  Against the wishes of nearly the ENTIRE security force Duke Energy management enforces this schedule to “bridge the gap” between Nuclear and Natural Gas from an economic standpoint.  Before you apply or accept a position be sure to understand the FULL details of the work schedule."
good,"Great Company and benefits. Unfortunately it is very hard to get hired on full time unless you know someone. Very competitive for even the entry level positions, again unless you know someone."
good,"Showed customer energy conservation measures that helped them reduce & control energy usage. Installation of several energy conservation measures (ECM""s) like rapping hot water tanks."
good,"My Manager did not have any management skills.  He didn't keep in contact with his team that was just outside his office or the team that was located in Charlotte, NC."
good,Great work environment.  Issues with management adjusting to changes in technology and employee growth.  Advised if you are on a contract to make sure that you receive confirmation of future placement or opportunities for growth.
good,There is little to no room to advance within the company. At many times someone is already in mind for a job and company goes through the motions to satisfy HR.
good,"Making several customer calls, processing sales, contracts, award letters, donation letters, transferring material within the company. "
good,I love my job but I have no benefits and few chances to progress in my current position.  I work with great people which makes working here enjoyable.
good,If you have good management you can really be happy with Duke Energy. I really love the company as a whole and believe that you can be a success with Duke Energy.
good,"I worked as a contractor; work environment was nice until changes started coming down the chain. "
good,"Great Benefits, time off.  Not much opportunity for Admins to advance.  Some managers want to micro manage."
good,Great place to work........Great work/Life balance......Great commission benefits......... Job security............No advancement opportunities at the call center
good,"Comically, tragically underqualified folks who are friends/relatives of decision makers are hired as employees to manage seasoned contractors who have given, in some cases, years of dedicated, expert level service to the company yet are never hired. Besides being unfair, it impedes success and in some cases is dangerous."
good,"Great Company, decisions are questionable.  The company is a regulated utility, therefor a lot of the decisions are made based on the utilities commission and federal regulations."
good,"All-in-all a good place to work. However, there is a wide range of work ethics here. Some FTers are working at a snail's pace. While others are working crazy hours to get things done. Managers act super busy but are really just going to meetings and approving tickets while the contractors do all the work. When a project is super important and is ready to go live, managers go on vacation. There is a strange drive to get things done but the environment is built around policies and procedures that are buried in bureaucracy and spreadsheets.  Everything you do requires a ticket with multiple approvals at several levels. So, middle managers are sitting around just approving tickets all day. Something that could take 5 minutes to do, takes 2 days because of tickets and approvals. You pretty much have to escalate everything to get anything done. But, the middle managers don't dare bother upper-level managers for some fear factor reason."
good,I worked at Duke Energy as a contractor so my time was really short. I didn't really enjoy working at Duke Energy because I found they were behind the times and brought Accenture in housen to manage  most projects.
good,"This is a great company; however, many employees are contractors without benefits or vacation time.  Even though you know you are a contractor with indefinite extensions, they are slow to hire anyone on a permanent basis.  Different managers give different versions of contractor status and future outcomes which sends mixed signals to temp employees.  "
good,Very large company to work for.  Great coworkers.  Stressful job with little pay.
good,Learned a great deal and enjoyed the people at the plant.  I was not given the opportunity to continue work after internship ended due to Duke Energy not hiring any additional techs.  Overall loved the work.
good,When I worked for Duke it was a call center position. The pay and benefits were good. But I was constantly hounded by supervisors. Durin outages they can tell you you can't go home if call volume is high.
good,I had a lot of opportunities to provide engineering input to complex projects. They provided me with a lot of guidance when needed. It was an enjoyable experience.
good,"Duke Energy was named one of Fortune magazine's ""World's Most Admired Companies"". They continue to execute a customer-focused strategy that is guiding investments and delivering value to customers."
good,"Organization is challenged to ""do more with less"" in order to compete with renewable and natural gas power generation. This results in taking on additional responsibilities without increased compensation."
good,I was an outside contractor and found Duke to be compliant with safety regulations and took employee safety seriously.  My interactions with Duke employees or contracted employees were always positive
good,Segun lo q he leido es que le falta prganizarce con los pagos de las comisiones
good,"I was over-qualified for the job, but I was semi-retired, and just looking for interesting work. The work was just what I was looking for. My biggest problem was I had to learn about the computer software used by the company, since I am not a computer geek."
good,The job was awesome. Team dynamics and friendly co-workers was not a strong suite. Not very much communication.  They take a long time to hire. Other employees aren't very friendly. The work itself and the job was very easy and independent.
good,people work together to accomplish their assigned tasks. work activities can change allowing people to work in different areas of maintenance gaining to skills.best part of this company is working with different people. management is kind of night and day depending on the supervisor or manager.
good,Duke Energy is a great place to work with great benefits. I will say that they are very generous with vacation time and also sick time. Working in a call center is not for everyone.
good,"At Duke, employees are given much importance rather than anything. Employee safety and comfort are highly considered which impressed me the most. There was never a bad or a typical day here as we have a team that was sharing and caring about each other."
good,"Start off I enjoyed the work and the field I was in, but my typical day was 6:30 to 5pm, come home and then I would be glued to my phone responding to emails and text. My typical day I would work 10-12 hours, and that didnt stop M-F, I would also work on the weekends. I was a able to learn and excel a lot on what was given to me. Duke has the culture of do the job you want, so you would do a higher paying job with hopes that you would get it. Culture was mixed, huge on safety and work life balance, and do less with less, but the push was more work with less resources, hints why the long hours."
good,"Good Co-workers, good pay. Relatively good work / life balance.  Change is inevitable and is common.  Very detail oriented. Challenging with plenty to do and learn."
good,"pay is good, customer service reps start off at 15 per hour and there is a .50 raise every 6 months up until $17-$18 but they dont care about your life, they require and mandate you to be there"
good,"Duke Energy just finished geospatially enabling their asset management system (IBM Maximo Spatial), which runs on the ESRI platform.  By porting GIS data previously bound in an engineering design system (GE Smallworld) to the ESRI platform, geospatial data became central to almost every business process, almost overnight.  This has created an explosion of demand for GIS skills; however, management has little familiarity with the skillsets required, or with their value in the marketplace, so job titles, career paths, and compensation are all problematic.  So, great place to work for cutting-edge GIS, but hard place to get ahead."
good,Honestly it was for a contractor that was re-roofing the entire plant and it wasn't for me. Hard labor and sometimes you get rained or stormed out of work. I personally cannot rely on the weather to work.
good,"Duke energy is a great company to work for, once you actually work there. Nearly all employees are hired through contracting firms first, and then re-interview for their own job after 1-3 years."
good,Go in positive and ready to learn. Allow for error because they will be there to assist you. Be ok time. Have a positive attitude and allow yourself to grow.
good,Enjoyed working with Houston based domestic and international development groups.  Very dynamic and terrific group to work with.  Remote management/oversight reflected heavily regulated perspectives which clashed with local leadership from time to time.  Overall a good place to work.
good,"It was a factory environment.  I would collect the timesheets daily, review for completness, post the labor onto a worklog, post time off onto a yearly schedule, enter the time into the payroll system, and submit the timesheets to the supervisor for approval.  I would alos prepare and assign new work assignments based on data posted in the company's corporate system.  My desk was off by itself so it was mostly quiet and I spent most of my time alone.  The hardest part of the job was understanding what was aluminum parts verse steel parts since I was rarely in the shop.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"the environment nice and pleasant, co workers some was easy to work with and some was not.. the overall atomsphere was okay. There was no teamwork within the company at all"
good,"Most plants are in the middle of nowhere. McGuire is situated between a rural town, Denver, and the northern part of the Charlotte metro, Huntersville. "
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. The work was hard but the job was rewarding and the pay was good. I had great benefits and would recommend them to anyone looking for a utility job in the area.
good,Too many changes in leadership that changed the culture of the company in ways that were not in my generations best interests. I left under good terms
good,"Worked there since right after high school until I retired 36 years later. Once the ""bigger is better"" mentality took over the utility industry, things went down hill.  Corporate decisions were ""one-size-fits-all"", which was a little impractical in a utility spanning two or three time zones."
good,"Deal with some rude customers. Learned how to be more patient. My specific supervisor is awesome. Work environment is laid back but fast paced at the same time. Call center, you get back to back calls. The hardest part of the job  is the constant changing schedules every year and mandatory overtime especially when there is storms, makes it hard for people with children. The most enjoyable part of the job is your co workers and the pay & bonuses."
good,Varied workplace with ability to apply several skills sets over my career. This allowed me to establish a career path with the chance to develop many of my own processes.
good,This is a great place to work at. The people are amazing and very focused to deliver results at minimum cost while keeping safety as their number one priority. I strongly recommend anyone considering working for this company to take the challenge.
good,"Excellent safety standards, strong support for healthy work/life balance. Great culture, good benefits, good work life balance."
good,"I was a contractor so there was never any security.  work environment was decent, people were great.  Managers is numerous positions could use more training."
good,"Great supply chain program teaching all the basics of sourcing, contract management, and supplier relationship. Great opportunities to join challenging projects."
good,its been a pleasent place with day to day challenges to work for the challenging envirnoment with dynamic roles and responsiblites to work every has been a good challenge to work for with the elite group of people.
good,"Working as a PM or engineer at a nuclear station can be difficult with ever changing NRC mandated responses to RFI and physical plant modifications"
good,"La parte más difícil era trabajar sólo. Hay buen ambiente, la dirección es Ayacucho 534."
good,Company tries to balance work and life demands while providing a reliable product to the customers. The demands this creates can seem unbalanced at times.
good,"Hard to say much about the company as I only worked there 1 yr as a co-op. I enjoyed my rotations, though. I worked operations and maintenance and in large capital engineering."
good,"Nice to work with Duke Energy. Good people all around, Infrastructure, Productive and Fun Work Place."
good,Great place to work.  More than half of the workers at Duke are contract employee's..  That means that at any given time they can part ways with you without much effort.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me logging onto the new Avaya Phone systems and beginning to take inbound phone calls from customers regarding payment issues, or general inquires. If the customer was from a North Carolina customer, then I would transfer the call to a customer service representative in Charlotte, North Carolina.  What I learned professionally was how to access customer's account information to make changes to them if necessary. Personally, I learned to persevere on difficult days. My manger was a great guy and he would reward our whole office lunch on the weeks our executives seen our outstanding progress. My co- workers at first were flabbergasted by my tenacity for solving problems with very little training. Honestly, my co-workers' personalities were transparent but overall as a team, we produced outstanding results. the hardest part of the job was dealing with resentment from being the ""new girl.""  They thought I was there to delay their progress. There was room for everyone to succeed and I tried my very best to show my co-workers that by continuing to be professional, but honest. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work and listening to the North Carolina customers on the other end of the line. It truly reminded me of my hometown and everyday I got to help people save money both here in Florida and in North Carolina."
good,Duke Energy is a long standing company with options to gain experience in multiple roles. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a hard working and collaborative team with an excellent leader.
good,My only concerns is helping and making sure each customers are happy and that he or she gets what she or he wants or needs! Customers are always right and customers are always right
good,"Se aprenden bastantes cosas. El lugar de trabajo esta ubicado en uno de los departamentos más bonitos del Perú, el clima del lugar es extraordinario. El ambiente laboral es bastante bueno. Realizaba campeonatos de fútbol para los trabajadores."
good,"Fun work place and can have a supportive management"
good,"It was good learning experience. Finance Office is THE department to work with."
good,"Can be very political and hard to move around and up in the company.  Like most corporate America, it's who you know, not what you know."
good,"Rotating Shifts "
good,"Responsible for the requalification of licensed operators at the "
good,"A typical day would be to take 80-100 calls working in the credit department dealing with customer credit checks for start service, also transfer, or stop services, help customers understand their bills and also process payments and set up payment agreements."
good,"typical day at work was 9 hours"
good,"Provide excellent customer service to corporate executives, directors and managers for all onsite events and meeting arrangements. Deliver supplies and materials to customers and specific locations in an efficient and timely manner. Create new ideas and strategies to improve customer service and job quality performance.Prepare and maintain inventory of materials in Annex building for the entire Progress Energy, which includes light fixtures, ballasts, and fire extinguishers."
good,"Typical day included emails, writing contracts, communicating with clients and vendors.  Management and co-workers very supportive and easy to work with.  "
good,We were under an audit deadline situation and no one dropped the ball. Very impressive group of people.
good,8.6 years on Informatica power center with experience of development and support projects. Also worked at onshore for 4 years at US client location.
good,"Close to home, challening post which allowed me to grow into a Master Scheduler. I wish I could work there longer, but my project is coming to a close. Once you are made an Employee you pretty much can count it as a job for life. They take care of their Employees."
good,"I learned a lot about the industry while working at Duke Energy.  The people are friendly.  Communication between employers and managers can sometimes be less than desirable, but overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"Depending on your shift you may have an 8-5... being it either an 8 hour or 10 hour day. Again depending on your shift you may work M-F or have days off during the week. If you're not so lucky or if you actually want it. There are Saturday hours as well. You will learn all about the electric utility industry as a base rep. The shame of the call center is, as a base rep you are timed on every call. It is quite difficult to maintain good call times do the extreme variation of call types you may receive. There are very few departmentalized calls. You will take the brunt of aggravated customers who call in. You will be expected to take the abuse of the customer and manage the call ""quality"" in a professional manor. Unless the customer asks for a supervisor repeatedly you cannot transfer the call. If you get the opportunity to advance, I recommend leaving the call center for another department. "
good,"Duke Energy gave me the opportunitity ot jumpstart my professional career as an intern.  They trust workers with a large amount of responsibility and accountability.  Sometimes the environment is high-stress and fast-paced, but employees are always helpful and open to questions."
good,• Provided superior technical and logistical support to recruiters.
good,I enjoyed working @ Duke because it worked with my schedule being a single parent @ the time raising 2 girls alone.
good,Very Impressed by leadership's response to challenges and employee welfare.  Friendly and inviting place to work.  People tend to work and retire from Duke Energy.  That says a lot in today's workforce.
good,"What I have learned at Duke is as long as you do your job, the advancements are unlimited. It is a very stressful atmosphere and is not for everybody. There is really no work/life balance working for Duke. So you have to be very flexible."
good,"Working here is not for everyone, very very stressful at times! Phones are constantly ringing... CONSTANTLY. Pay is good, benefits are good. Breaks (2) go by very fast, lunch is only 30 mins so if you didn’t pack you lunch you might as well not eat. Customers are rude, mandatory overtime almost every week so be prepared! Coworkers are very nice! Say a prayer, have great patience & smile!"
good,Overall Duke Energy is a good place to work.  Most Managers are helpful to their employees.  There is constant stress but that is expected in a nuclear environment.
good,"•	Receive incoming Provider tasks and updates all Production Tracking Logs  "
good,Being a Duke Energy employee has provided me with a lot of opportunities for growth and development. The company is always looking to change and improve their image by focusing on the customer. These sometime lead to manager changing department every 2-4 years or company reorg.Duke is a solid company but us under going some change within its corporate structure. Expert constance changes as the company focus will continue to change with the business strategies. For anyone looking to be employed at Duke being agile and versatile will provide new opportunities during your career there.
good,"Full-time employees seem very happy with the security and benefits that come with a position at Duke Energy. The company relies heavily on contractors, however, which I think is an unfair practice of corporations in general."
good,Duke Energy provides many benefits other than pay and insurance. This company also ensure they are competitive with other similar companies to provide benefits to enhance employee lives.
good,"Offers an exceptional 401K plan, that affords financial planning for the future. Health insurance is adquate and ""gets the job done"" "
good,"It was a safe place to work with great pay.  Fast pace, some hard work at times.  But overall the team makes it lighter.  I learned safty procedures, team work, and time management."
good,There are vast differences between nuclear department and all others which have more flexibility and better quality of life.  Managers in nuclear are expected to work 5 x 12 schedules a few times each year plus be on weekly call duty every 5-8 weeks. Much better quality of life for non-managers.
good,"Duke Energy is a strong company with dedicated employees with a historic focus on reliable energy. As renewable energy has become increasingly cheaper additional focus is being put on renewables which is beginning to change workforce needs and adjustments to run profiles. Even in this transitional phase, Duke has been a good company to work for."
good,At your computer most of the day copleting servcie orders that were not completed in the field by a technician. Completed about 100 to 200 wfm's (servcie orders manually). Nice work place but can be very busy at time because there is always work to be done in billing. And bills have to be accurate or we have to cancel and rebill them. Hardest part of the job is if the system does not like the reading or meter # provided you have to figure out a way to make it work if it was really completed in the field. But I love most of the people I work with they make the day go by.
good,"The work/life balance could be better"
good,"Great place to work. Some supervisors have their favorites and that can be frustrating. Because their are multiple shifts, it's easy to find a shift that works for you."
good,The culture of safety is really great.  There is a lot of opportunity to grow. There are many people in cincinnati who have been with the company for 30+ years.
good,"Duke Energy is a great place to work."
good,Nice place to work with great benefits. But you have to deal with highly stressful calls. You are required to work overtime almost every week and during any weather events.
good,"Duke used to be the ultimate place to work.  Relatively speaking it is still one of the best.   This is no longer the amazing company that so many people in Western NC and SC longed to work for.  Some say they merged with Progress Energy but it has turned out to be a hostile takeover by Progress.  The culture of Duke was kind and friendly.  Progress has a culture of money being more highly regarded than people and anti-team.  They reward employees for reporting coworkers for the most trivial matters.  They call it ""coaching,"" but people waste countless hours responding to silly ""observations"" that have been turned in.   "
good,I recommend Duke Energy as a good place too work. There are many stressed days and nights but overall I enjoyed the time I spent at duke. I miss the people but i'm enjoying retirement.
good,"Excellent Company to work for. with Great Benefits."
good,"The work experience is satisfactory but the hours can be extremely long. However, the work is not physically or mentally demanding. I would recommend working for this company."
good,The company was good to the employees during my tenure.  I have no regrets for the time I spent at Duke.  The work could be stressful with power outages and working swing shifts.
good,"Job Security, very busy day, have learned a lot over the 10years I have been at Duke. I have seen many people come and go, many Managers come and go. Most enjoyable part of my job is helping others."
good,"Love the line of work and what we get to do everyday, tons of solid OTJ training received from great Journeymen who are more than willing to help you learn.  Hardest part of the job is the callouts in the middle of the night in all kinds of weather, but it's also great to see people's power restored when they need it the most."
good,"When you take a job as a CW, or contract, or temp, whatever you call it you take your chance.  Duke has some CW's who have been there 13 years.  Other contracts get cancelled because of group restructuring.  Guess I go unlucky.  Working at Duke is really nice, wish I could stay but I drew the short stick."
good,"Duke Energy is a very respectable company to work for; however, I would like a job where there is more advancement so I can make it a career."
good,"Helping kids to read and solve math problems. Which wasn't done on a daily basis. But when they needed us to attend class rooms, we were there."
good,"Standard work, though very challenging.  Heavily driven work environment."
good,"A typical work day of late has been in the construction phase. Write a procedure to clear a bank panel, which will contain HT, Transformer, LT relays. Remove elector-mechanical relays, install new SEL-351 for the HT; SEL-387 for the transformer, SEL-351 for the LT. Load settings into the relays, test the relays with RTS, and save data, move on to logic check out with a simulator. While performing that task, coordinate with control support too remove old control wiring and install new. While equipment is cleared relay technicians is responsible for testing the CT's before placing them back in service. That is the water down version of our job. This does not include a day of PM's for carrier terminal, etc. As a whole, Duke Energy has the potential to be awesome. With any big company there is a lot of moving parts, and staying focus on the task can be daunting. If one department is not able to complete their task. That will impact the next step of the process. The biggest enjoyment comes from doing actual functioning test on a scheme that we just installed. And working correctly! LOL!!!"
good,"I arrive at work and get started right away,housekeeping then on to pulling orders,stocking,data entry,shipping and recieveing."
good,"Very fast paced, every industry specific, exciting place to be."
good,"Company culture is very old-school and upper management is not good at communicating with employees within specific departments.  Technology is all over the place and IT does not always know what they are doing.  They prefer to hire contract employees versus actual Duke employees in an effort to cut cost, but this creates a revolving door, as they do not ever intend to offer these employees permanent positions. Contractors are treated very differently from employees and receive no benefits, paid holidays, etc. As an employee, there is little opportunity for movement or growth.  They do not often promote from within.  Overall the culture is stagnant at best and it's a job that pays the bills."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company.  With the changes and relocation it was time for me to move on and explore my opportunities and enjoy time at home.
good,I really enjoyed working for Duke Energy. The people were super friendly and nice. Team oriented environment. Too many reorganizations and contractors.
good,I was employed at Duke Energy for almost 8yrs in two different roles. The only reason I left was for better pay. If I would not have gotten a really good offer from an electrical contractor I would probably still be there.
good,I worked there for 3 years and I enjoyed it for the most part. It was very stressful due to the high call volume and the metrics that was used to grade the calls.
good,"Great place to work. No work life balance however. They really take care of their employees but if a major weather catastrophe hits, you have mandatory overtime for days and days with no day off. Great money, but can burn you out."
good,It is an ok place to work. Not able to say anything about the company. Plenty of calls on a daily basis. One would enjoy if you prefer fast pace environment. People here are friendly.
good,Duke has been a good company to work for.  The jons I have had over the years have beed diverse and interesting.  I have learned a lot over the years.
good,"A typical work day at Duke Energy power plants started with a safety review of the various tasks to complete for the day.  An hour before the end of each day, a review of the work completed was discussed and any problems/issues and solutions to implement to the completion of a task or project."
good,As a call center representative it's probably the best call center job around. If you are used to call centers it's a great job. However there isn't a point system. Sales are involved.
good,Fun and productive place to work. The people are really awesome and knowledgeable. Recent management decisions have been pro company and not in the best interest of the employees or local plants.
good,Duke Energy is a great company to work for. They offer a variety of employee benefits and are generally able to support flexible schedules. The people that work at Duke Energy are wonderful. The culture is a bit dated and in general utility companies are slow to change so do not expect the innovation of a Google or other tech giant.
good,"Overall , good company to work for.  Good benefits and pay. The buddy system is alive and well. Does a lot for the community. The company is now having layoffs and the moral is going down hill.."
good,Only a contractor at Duke with NO benefits for 11 1/2 years.  Never was hired but was never told why not.  Work with a great group of people.  Learned a lot about big office environment.
good,Contracted work installing new house power panels on older homes. Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment is a must. Hard work but enjoyed weekends off.
good,"I enjoy the environment. it's fast pace but nothing too much. A typical day is very busy. Most of the time, you lose track of the time. Lunches are roughly about 30 minutes on a 12 hour shift."
good,I enjoyed working in the field during these times. It was a bit difficult to find the work sites at times and there was also some problems with communication for pesticide use and spraying.
good,"good job, good pay rotating shift every other weekend off and plenty of overtime available  very good with training opportunities and plenty of certifications"
good,Duke Energy has been a really good company to work for. They have helped me out when me and my family needed it the most. The compensation in pretty good as well.
good,"Being a nuclear plant, there are a lot of rules and regulations that govern our business. The only way to ensure those regulations are followed is by a very strict set of procedures that have to be followed to the letter. If someone enjoys structure, this is a great place. If someone likes to be a free thinker and think outside the box, it may not fit them."
good,"The culture around the office is great, typical call center environment. The night shift is very laid back and the only con is when you get occasional customers who use abusive language over the phone."
good,Duke Energy rewards individuals for hard work.  This hard work can spill into very long weeks.  The expectations are high in this work environment but the rewards are also high.
good,"I was contracted to complete merger related work, which was challenging and I learned quite a bit.  I did stay on longer and worked as a regular contractor, but the work finally ran out."
good,I love working for Duke but the pay compensation is not consistent or fair. Job is very high paced and intense for projects. Details are important. I was offered an extension on my contract but the pay was not acceptable for the level of work required.
good,Hard to move up in IT.  The company is going through a major shift in the IT Department that has far-reaching implications.  This change is not being managed well.
good,High job security.  Duke Energy us a Fortune 100 company with great opportunities to advance.  Salaries are highly competitive and benefits are comparable to other large corporations.
good,"Flexible work schedules were available based on work performance.  Overtime was available, both voluntary and mandatory.  I liked my work.  It was challenging.  There were too many personal relationships in the area where I worked  (i.e., friends and family) and opportunities were based on favoritism.  Leadership decisions were divisive and lowered moral instead of building teamwork."
good,"I have submitted this review already and given my opinion. This company has its pros and cons like every other company. During my time there, I had more pros thans cons."
good,We are customer service oriented electricity provider. A typical day is buzzing with many activities going on simultaneously and constant interactions not only with our external customers but also with internal departments.
good,"This is nuclear power. 100% compliance with regulations federal, state & local. High scrutiny of all your work. Work load is high and detailed. Attention to detail is paramount. Craft & tech people are great to work with. Immediate, first-line management is overworked."
good,Pretty good company to work for benefits are decent pay is comparable to other utility companies.  Coworkers are good management is pretty good.
good,"The hardest part of my job was finding information sometimes, however the company did find more ways to search information not only for customers but for employees."
good,Duke Energy was a good place to work until the new CEO took over.I worked in Production Services for almost 16 yrs and they told us that our job was safe but only to turn around after 3 months later to tell us our job was outsourced to a company called Kubra in NJ. We proved that we could do the work cheaper in 2014 but they went ahead and outsourced our job anyway. The CEO put a freeze on wages and hiring so 4 of us on in Production Service's were put out of a job.
good,Working at Duke Energy was a great experience. It taught me that hard work and attention to detail are important parts of all jobs. My co-workers and I at the plant worked together to make the plan run more efficiently and on budget.
good,"•	Utilize the Piccasso ticketing system"
good,"Very focused on average handle time of the agents call. High expectations for all phone calls to be answered within so many seconds of coming in, as well as having the customer's concerns resolved in a timely manor also. Help often available via instant messaging with supervisors, team leads, and support from other agents."
good,A typical day at work is busy and very fast-paced. I learn something new everyday. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a lot of paper.
good,You are assigned work on a daily basis. Departments have different job duties and you have the opportunity to bid for open jobs in every department. Management is good and most of the time they let individuals do their work without supervision as long as deadlines are met.  Hardest part is having to work shifts that include weekends and holidays.  Good communication throughout organization. Good benefits and good pay in an industry that has a great future.  Good place to work.
good,"Rotating shift work, 12.5 hour works days.  Job number one is always keeping the public safe."
good,I have an opportunity to work every day with dedicated employees who are commited to doing the right things in order to ensure corporate success.
good,"Duke is a great place to work. Most of the management is good....unless those that are ready to retire. Work life balance depends on the department that you work in, but overall it's pretty good."
good,Early start including meetings to define daily tasks.  Optimized planning efforts for high priority items. Strong safety culture.  Enjoyed working with fellow employees.
good,"Duke Energy is a good company to work for.  Depending on the work group you are assigned to, advancement opportunities may be limited.  Overall, management is very supportive."
good,I  don’t have anything additional to add. Please just apply it’s a great place to work. I enjoyed they office I worked out of we were more like family then co workers
good,"Nuclear Generation, my department, was known for its culture of safety and integrity, of ""doing right things in the right way."" We were known as the division that did not jaywalk, always held handrails on stairs, and looked out for each other."
good,"Since it was an outage, had to be there very early and worked late into the day. I worked 70 hours in a week and was asked to relocate even when I told them I could not. However, the work was well organized and management was not rude or hard to work with."
good,"Compensation and benefits were great. Base pay was above average and also received yearly bonus. 401K matching was best I've seen. "
good,Nuclear power plant work can be very challenging some days. I was released from Duke in Dec due to resource reductions. I can not go back to work for Duke until a year.
good,"Be ready to work customer service, non stop calls ranging from short and pleasant to long and chaotic. You will provide customer service for just about everything under the sun with electrical everything."
good,"Management open to employee concerns, and always trying new techniques to improve delivery pace.  The project I worked on required long hours to complete, perhaps due to improper planning."
good,"Difficult work, high pressure, but fair workplace.  Compensation was very fair.  Work/life balance was as expected.  Culture could be supportive but you were expected to deliver regardless."
good,Duke Energy is a great place to work. There are great  benefits and wonderful environment. Only issue is you can be required to work mandatory OT within minutes of your schedule ending and there is no definite attendance policy. Advancement is sometimes based off who you know instead of what you know. Opportunity to advance. 24 hour center do hours could vary greatly. Overall great place to work.
good,Strong company and able to advance in career. Lots of ability to work on major capital projects and interface with many smart individuals. Was able to make an impact early on.
good,"Fast-paced environment, workload manageable, training was adequate for job requirements.  Access to required computer network  software and applications was a little slow, and access approval to building (ID card) took a little longer than anticipated."
good,"Duke has a wonderful culture.  The culture following the acquisition of PNG has been positive.  There is a lot of work to do, and the workforce has accepted the challenge."
good,"Duke Energy was a launch pad not a landing pad. I provided value and in return I gained tremendous experience. "
good,Duke Energy is a safety minded place to work.  Safety is enforced to the utmost degree.  I've never feared for my safety working on a Duke Energy site and know that everything is done strictly by the books.
good,"Duke Energy was a great place to begin my career in Safety Management.  They provided me the opportunity to heighten my education and move into management roles.  Hardest part of the job was the changes in management, overcoming the expectations of different personalities."
good,"Worked at nuclear Plant, fast paced and must be accurate.  Great co-workers and management, everyone had the same goal to achieve, keep the plant running safely."
good,"As a contract project manager, work was fast-paced and rewarding.  Initially, some good training was provided to prepare me as a new candidate, however ongoing training and development opportunities were limited."
good,The nuclear professionals take their jobs very serious. The work weeks are long and can be stressful at times. The company as a whole compensates their employee well for their work.
good,Worked with engineers; work place culture and diversity was great; working in document control with very knowledgeable people made the invironment pleasureable
good,"Duke Energy was a good place to work.  The work load was steady, but not overwhelming.  The benefits were very good and the salaries were decent.  Promotions were based more on partisanship than skill level.."
good,"Very good job security with good benefits. Very large company, therefore job experience and culture will differ depending on location and department. Overall, good working experience."
good,I enjoyed my time at Duke Energy. The atmosphere was what I liked best. Communication could be better but overall I'm not complaining. If you work in IT its a tough place to get hired on with permanently.
good,"Good work environment."
good,I enjoyed my daily work schedule at Duke Energy. From the paperwork to the leadership role it was an exciting experience. Management was easy to work with. they understood the daily work stresses. work place culture was very healthy for anyone willing to learn accept change.
good,"Great crew to work with. I learned to manage multiple projects at one time including finical, work schedule planning, vendor support, work order planning, project controls,"
good,This  is a good company to work for.  However the recent mergers have placed intense pressure on the company to intensify their continuous improvement effort to a level that at times can seem chaotic.  If you are young I would recommend pursuing a position with Duke Energy.
good,"Duke Energy is trying to update their employee base as they are known as the good-ol-boy company where families used to get hired there and stay an average of 35 years or more. Because they're investing in new energy technology, they require a workforce that educated in these sciences which means they are' offering retirement packages for old-timers to make room for more updated studies."

good,I've enjoyed working with the same group for almost 4 years (on and off) during outage time. The nuclear industry is constantly changing and always keeps me on my toes. Learning new things all the time. The job is never boring. I like the mental as well as physical aspects of the jobs. The hardest part is traveling 3000 miles each way at the beginning and ending of each outage season.
good,"I enjoy Duke Energy as a company.  I started at Robinson while they were still Progress Energy.  The merge has been interesting, and there has been some engrained ""traditions"" that need to change to align Robinson Nuclear Plant with the rest of the fleet.  Overall I enjoy working at Robinson, and for Duke Energy."
good,Plenty of IT projects in the works.  Safety and customer service are key objectives for the company.  My positions in the company have taught me be versatile and flexible.  Co-workers are pleasant. Job responsibilities can be demanding but you can learn a lot if you put forth the effort.  The most enjoyable part of the work is the satisfaction in resolving your internal or external customer's technology issue.

good,"The company is very devoted to training employees and their resources available to provide support at the call center are amazing.  "

good,"Compensation, work-life balance, and flexible work hours are the best aspects of my experience working at Duke. I am a contingent worker and not a permanent employee."
good,I loved working there if my mother hadn’t got sick I would have stayed and not moved out of state. The people there where good to me the food was really good on lunch break and the job over all was a good experience
good,"Very helpful staff and management! Teamwork was the motto here and they were right! Although if there were power outages or natural disasters it was mandatory to stay on ( pack a bag with personal hygiene items, books, clothes and whatever you’d need for an overnight once the seasons change), they treat you with respect and you never feel alone."
good,"Excellent Company, started as Developer then moved into Management over a 21 year career."
good,"With Duke Energy you will learn quickly what a Power Plant is all about and how it is run. Safety and care to the environment are taken seriously. Overall, I love working for this company"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Duke.  Good work-life balance. Great leadership.  If it was not for the geographical location of all of the plants within the Duke fleet, I would still be working there.  We did not like living in the SouthEast."
good,I have learned a lot working at Duke.  They tend to promote from within and have a pretty decent work/life balance.  A typical day can include quite a bit of meetings but that also depends on what department you work in.
good,Great place to work even though it is a large company. I am a contractor and I am trying to become a full-time employee. I enjoy the people at work and the culture.

good,"Start at 6 am 1 hr safety and discuss work orders. We do a pre-job and discuss hazards and steps to complete work. We do all our time.work etc.on our own computers. Learned more about troubleshooting, breaker pm’s and the whole picture how the plant operates instead of just the construction side. Management is friendly and helpful. I enjoy working here no complaints until I get Laid off."
good,"Days were very busy yet relaxed. I realized great opportunities to learn and build on for future growth in the company.  We were encouraged to work collectively to build and grow ideas, in doing so I realized that team work in most cases is most effective.  Management was most always accessible and open minded. In meeting tax deadlines to ensure taxes were paid timely and accurately to avoid possible penalty assessment was the most challenging part of my responsibilities while employed with Progress/Duke Energy. Finalizing all annual payroll tax filings without error was very rewarding. I also enjoyed implementing new and improved processes  to reduce the errors in the processes for which I was responsible."
good,"plenty of opportunities within the company.  people stay in Duke for a long time and they need to learn new ways.  great pay, okay benefits, and great coworkers."

good,"Good place to work - good balance - near my home - good computer work - I tried to merge 2 databases from an merger. Good manger, good relations with other developers."
good,Duke Energy is a good job that requires a lot of physical labor. The culture is very laid back but also can require some strenuous and fast paced labor depending on the time lines and deadlines that are set in place.
good,Duke is a great place to work because you are allowed opportunities to move within the company.  The management allows you to move after 1 year in a particular position.  One can rotate sooner if the move is due to a promotion.
good,Great experience and plenty of opportunities to see the country and get your hands on different types of Tech. Everyone for the most part gets along and theirs nobody ever yelling at you.
good,Great company culture. Feels like a family atmosphere when working. Flexible work hours. Disorganized standards but vast utility experience throughout the workplace.
good,"A typical day involves sorting and disposition various types of meters, transformers, and some communication equipment.  I learned about single and poly phase meters and their uses.  Management is highly approachable and open to suggestions.  If you want to learn anything new at work, this is a great place to be.  Good work ethic and a desire to learn go far."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, the overall job was very stressful.  A typical day would involve, assisting customers with billing inquiries, entering all data and maintaining current information within a large database, dispatching electric and gas emergencies,"
good,"Good Equipment, Employees are well trained and receive competitive pay. Good Benefit packages. High Stress jobs."
good,Great company to work for if you can get your foot in the door.  I have worked 3 temp positions there and they always seem to be great to work for.Great group of people.  Int he nuclear area you get a longer weekend.
good,Duke is a great place to work from a culture and work/life balance standpoint.  It can be frustrating at the lack of accountability and the seemingly absence of decision makers.
good,"In Duke Energy, I learned the ways to deal with day to day tasks. I was lucky to have some really good co workers. the environment here encourages you to get involved"
good,"Spent the day preparing computers for employees, taking care of my warehouse and helping my coworkers.  I learned more about computers and inventory control.  The managers that I had were always very helpful with work problems and personal problems.  I got along with all of my co-workers and we helped each other as much as possible.  The hardest part of my job was getting everything done.  Just wasn't enough time in the day.  The best thing about my job was that I did multiple jobs do I never got bored."
good,"Good work-life balance, compensation, benefits, etc.  There are a lot of good people with a lot of transmission, distribution and power generation knowledge."
good,I am a current employee with the company and the people are nice. I really don't have anything negative to say about the company. The work culture is serious about safety.
good,Great firm although I only worked here as a contractor the environment was excellent. They still have growing pains from the purchase of Progress Energy buy they are addressing these issues. I believe all Utilities face challenges in the future from Regulatory pressure and the eventual ability for a homeowner to power their dwelling with little assistance from a utility company.
good,"Good management, updated computer systems, good training, and enjoyable work environment.  Along with this the job is also somewhat high stressful and you don't always have as much assistance as needed, but something the company is currently working on."
good,"Nuclear energy is heavily regulated, and as such, successful employees are by-the-book kind of people. The environment is fast-paced and stressful. A standard 4/10 work schedule is available for many positions."
good,"There is a good work - life balance. "
good,"Working at the nuclear plant there are a lot of pluses and minuses. A typical work week for an engineer is M-Th which is great, you have very flexible hours and if your lucky you will have a great supervisor. This job has great job security so much so that they rarely want to let you move to a different position. I learned a lot from this company seeing that it was my first full time engineering job. Some days you do the same thing over and over again other days you can be in a complete world wind if there is an issue. That is when you may work 16+ hours troubleshooting an issue or even working 7 days a week. It all depends on the day. I don't see a lot of professional and personal growth development because like I said before they don't leave room for you to explore other positions."
good,"Great company to work for with many opportunities for advancement. I supplied millions of dollars worth of coal, lime, limestone, and fuel oil to 3 major power plants in the Cincinnati, OH area."
good,The position I know hold is a very challenging one. I use all of my previous work experience to help the craft supervision identify and eliminate or mitigate hazards. This helps with controlling the allowed risk verses completion of the project.
good,There are a lot of good people at Duke Energy and you will find it to be a family oriented environment.
good,Good company. Lots of work related to merger of Duke Power and Progress Energy. Great uptown Charlotte environment.
good,"-receive and process online request"
good,I was fortunate to get this job and learned a lot from it.  I was always proud to tell people who I worked for and what I did.
good,Working with true professionals with hearts of gold. Consolidation and many moves within due to mergers - all in all the company people can become like family to you.
good,Duke Energy is a very well ran business and was a good place to work. I learned a lot of computer programs and recieved training in my job and monthly coaching sessions. My co-workers were very nice but managment was sometimes hard to get a hold of.
good,"I started working here when I was 20. It was an excellent job with great pay for someone at my age. I learned a lot about business and computers while working there. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"Duke Energy is a vibrant and exciting company to work for. Even as a contractor during my time there, the company provided opportunities for advancement and training, along with exciting work and exposure to new technology. Would love to return as a full time employee."
good,"Entrevista normal, prueba practica, y unas serié de preguntas.."

good,"As an Intern at Duke Energy I traveled to a lot of customer sites. It seemed as if I was on the go all the time. The job was very challenging which made the experience very rewarding. The management clearly lays out the work week and work day. "
good,"good place to work, lots of structure and expectations.  Plant safety is responsible for all safety related activities concerning contractors and plant personnel"
good,Productive workplace with good scope of career advancement. Everyone is genuinely very supportive and wants the business to do well and succeed. There is a lot of opportunity to learn new technology and processes
good,Great company but job work/life balance could be better. The call center hours were changed with out notice and my position of at home agent was being changed back to going into the call center. The center is an hour away from my home and with the schedule changes I could no longer work there.
good,Good place to work. Good people to work with. I’ve enjoyed the learning experience and am thankful for all the people who have taught me along the way.
good,It is a place to work showcase your skills set and grow. Adequate offsite training is available. They balanced work and family management. Very diversed environment...
good,Most days are enjoyable and productive.  Management is easy to get along with and is helpful.   The workplace culture is very open and conducive to team work.
good,Fun environment. Great pay. Long hours. Micromanaging. But if you are a people person and work hard you may succeed. It’s a growing industry so there is always room for advancement.
good,"I liked working for Duke Energy Florida especially due to down town Saint Petersburg where Duke Energy's Florida headquarters are located was great a very nice secure building, Management was great I even got to meet the CEO of the company even though I was a Contingent Worker (Contractor) I was treated right and respected and invited to most all employee meetings,"
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Duke energy, I'm sorry it came to a end. the project I was sent here for wrapped up and my services were no longer needed. I learned a lot on how to manage different contractors that came to work on site."
good,Loved working there and would love to go back.  Hard to convince people to make changes but when successful it makes for a great job with the ability to see the effects of your efforts
good,I had a great time interning at Duke Energy and would recommend this company to anybody. Great people and great culture. Not a high stress job and everybody is very helpful.
good,"Good company to work for, gained a lot of skill sets, need more opportunities for growth. Great place to learn about customer service . It is a controlled environment ."
good,Not only do meetings foster growth but create a collaborative work environment. Sometimes the workflow can be rigid but that creates consistency and a clear path for success.
good,Was a good place to work. Have no idea what is going on now. it has been over 10 years ago and i have not lived in charolotte in a very long time.  dont...
good,Duke has been a good company to work for at times. They are a great company at times.  Sometimes there is a bit more churn and bureaucracy than is necessary. It is a rewarding experience working for Duke.
good,Duke Energy was a great place to work. I highly recommend working their. The pay and benefits are very good. Work life balance was very good too. They are still growing.
good,Worked to ensure the timely set up of accounts and accurate billing for services.  Our team provided excellent customer service to ensure utility services were installed or restored in a timely manner.
good,"Duke Energy is a great company to work for. The benefits are great and the people are even greater. The company focuses on safety of its employees as well as safety of the community. The people hired to work for Duke Energy are energetic, focused, dedicated and highly trained."
good,"usually 8 hour shifts, with a 30 minute break. There's always something to do or learn. I caught onto everything pretty fast as far as the system. Hardest part of the job would be the lack of assistance from my supervisor. Not too up to date on the system."
good,"Enjoyed working at Duke Energy.  Good training, benefits, room for advancement, good environment, good opportunities, available overtime, and flexible hours."
good,"I worked for Duke Energy as an intern reviewing contractor pricing data and was tasked with making a compelling argument for a contractor choice using the data provided. I felt like I was playing a real, useful role for the company and I enjoyed that challenge."
good,Too young to retire ater 36 years of dedication until Progress merger. Company did away with 2nd shift supervision and did not have place for another supervisor at the time.
good,"Duke-Energy employs and trained the masses of electrical / mechanical engineers, maintenance / instrument & control techniciains,,mechanics and  nuclear operator in the country   Duke is one of the largest contributors to the United Way Foundation and is the hub for the Emergency Response Organization for area emergency evacuations from natural disasters."
good,"Good work environment. Professional co-workers. Competitive pay. Fast paced, but no extreme pressure. Management was experienced and knew their job. I was hired to teach clearance processes to Duke employees and contractors, but the job expanded. I trained for and taught a variety of safety subjects. This was fun and challenging."
good,"Wish they had given more notice before job ended. Other than that it was a great work environment, great pay, good people , not a lot of work drama either"
good,Performed security patrols on a daily basis. Benefits are excellent and the pay is well worth it. Vacation and holidays are plenty and your work schedule is very beneficial.
good,I was a contractor on all of my assignments with Duke Energy and it was good work that was very important to the company.  The life extension at Oconee was critical to maintain a huge base load of power to the southeast US.  Doing plant modification estimates at the other units was critical during the extended plant life.
good,"Great place to work and does a great job compensating and retaining staff.  Despite the great environment, if feels as if we remain understaffed and have too many efforts in flight at any time."
good,Worked long hours and asked to work overtime at the last minute. hey had a crazy rotating shift that went from days to night in the same week. he best part was during the rotation there was a stretch of 8 days off in a row.
good,"Great place to work. Family atmosphere, but hours are sometimes demanding. This job provided me with a host of knowledge in the electric industry, and made it possible for many other opportunities to arise."
good,Dealt with fall protection issues where employees did not have a good grasp on the correct understanding of the policy. But accomplished allot form workers
good,"great place to work, great benefits, great supervision, great leadership, work schedule, Great community activities such as Habitat for Humanity, great leaders"
good,"Duke has been a great employer; work life balance is unparalleled and working environment is collaborative and supportive. I have seen a sea change taking place as the company tries to re-position to become more competitive in non-regulated markets.  Unfortunately it has begun to erode some of the qualities that made the company a great place to work over the last decade, however so far it's not completely ruined, just heading in the wrong direction."
good,Duke Energy nuclear work force is a strong competent team. They afford a safe working environment within the context of an operating nuclear power plant. Jobs are stressful and require a dedication to ensuring the power plant is safely operating 24 hours per day so work-life and home-life balance can at times be challenging.
good,Productive and fun company to work for. They are a family caring business. It is a relaxed environment. Business casual when it comes to the dress code. They care about your education and offer reimbursement.Good benefits and they offer 401K matching as well.They offer a work from home environment.
good,"My experience at Duke Energy was over ten years ago, prior to the spin off of Spectra Energy from Duke.  Therefore I don't believe I can provide a meaningful review."
good,"Comes with the typical headaches during the day-to-day activities, but you are well compensated and managers will work with you to ensure work/life balance is not impeded.  It is a business and Duke Energy is in the energy business to make money.  Therefore employees are expected to get their jobs done with minimal oversight."
good,"Duke Energy has undergone quite a few changes in the last 10 years to include 2 mergers (Progress Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas) and naming a new CEO. With that, a lot of the old Duke Energy culture has changed. However, still a good place to work."
good,We painted and ran errands for the maintenance shop.  We also cleaned and did odds and ends things.  It was a great job t have while being a college student.
good,We answer roughly 60 calls a day. The environment is nice and relaxed. The hardest part is not be able to solve an issue and having to route a ticket. The most enjoyale is being to solve and assist the end user.
good,"Enjoyed my work there. Glad that Duke is keen on the need for Organizational Change Management as part of the major projects that I was on. That this awareness is part of the culture helped my with my work. Charlotte is a great city. Duke is downtown. Would have liked a higher rate for the value that I provided when there, but oh well."
good,My role as a technical writer was exactly as expected.  I was hired for a specific task and it was as described.  The people are friendly and the management is focused.
good,"The job required some walking, sitting at post, watching monitors, climbing ladders, carrying guns and equipment.  You have periodic training that requires you to be physically fit."
good,Duke is a large organization with many moving parts. Despite this they make a real effort to give it that small organization feeling. It can take some time to learn how all of the business units fit together but most folks there are willing to help you out and point you in the right direction.
good,Very Micro-managed job. They dont care if you are getting threatened by customers even though its over the phone. When calls run over into your break they want you to just take the remaining time of your break so it doesn't mess up call volume. After I left they had a pay increase because of the such high turnover rate.
good,"A typical day at work was a Monday, I learned how to strengthen my research skills with the help of the team. Management are always helpful in all that they do."
good,Current leaders are personable and listen to their community.  Their jobs are very important to them and they treat every day with gratitude and hard work.
good,"Worked as a sub contractor for Duke,  but directly represented DE. Fast paced job and was given total control over the safety program.  I was also trained very well and used the training to help employees."
good,"Learned a lot from the seniors, mangement was very good, Friendly environment, work was most enjoyable, and there was not must stress from the management. Everything was in a balanced way."
good,"Duke is a great place to work; most of the people are supportive and helpful and the benefits are good; unfortunately, I've seen its commitment to employees continue to get overshadowed by its commitment to shareholders.  Senior leadership talks a good deal about wanting to be the best in the industry then does everything it can to drive towards ""middle of the pack"" when benchmarking reveals Duke to be an outlier in any type of employee perk.  (i.e., Duke want the benefits of having a great workforce, but no longer want to bare the cost). Changes in the workplace culture and employee moral have been gradually reflecting this shift for the past couple of years.  It's sad. I used to really love working there."
good,"The bosses at Duke Energy in Cincinnati, Ohio are very nice and outgoing. The atmosphere is there is warm and welcoming. The work is done to a high degree and much can be learned from your superiors."
good,A fast paced environment with very professional work force committed to the safe and reliable generation of electricity.  An enjoyable place to work with excellent teamwork.
good,Employees are encouraged to take charge of their careers. It's a large corporation with opportunities to move up and around.
good,"Although Duke Energy is a very large company, the people and technical managers there encourage a good close culture.  In addition they are very technically adept and keep up with current technologies.  My role as technical leader, architect and developer kept me in the place I wanted to be.  I enjoyed the people and technologies.  Hardest part of the job was learning expansive legacy folks and learning the networking.  In such a big company with such a rich history, this was a challenge."
good,I have enjoyed my time with Duke Energy and looked forward to gaining more experience. But due to Business Constraints I will not have that opportunity.
good,"Demanding work requires high standards, integrity, engaged attitude. The hardest part of working in this environment is the stress. The most enjoyable part of the job is the privilege of working with some of the best people this world has to offer. Dedicated, smart, hard working people. It made me a better human being by being around these people."
good,"A good company to work for.  fair to the employees and good pay.  safety is taken very serious ."
good,"Work from 7-3, day was sometimes stressful but overall work experience was great Learned how Nuclear works and plenty or radiation"
good,"I loved working for Duke energy.  They have a lot of great benefits including Health insurance, paid Holiday's, Vacation time.  I learned a lot while I was there and the only reason why I quit is to start my own trucking business and regret doing that."
good,"Retired at age 55 in 2007, with great retirement benefits. They had great work/life balance, and plenty of advancement opportunities.  I had 32 years in and made a lot of friends. Worked very hard and everyone I knew worked hard at what they did. Management was very fair for the most part. The best part of working there was that, depending on your position, you were treated with a lot of respect for what you brought to the table in experience. I have to say if I had to start working again at a full time job, Duke is the one Employer I would apply at."
good,"As a Meter Reader I would monitor commercial and residential consumers use of gas and electricity.  Routinely I would record readings and inspect meters for defects.  Each day was a challenge to work outdoors in unpredictable extreme weather conditions, all awhile avoiding dogs and other obstacles when approaching unknown property."
good,I enjoyed working with the people and for the company.  Opportunity for learning new things were always available.  A great group to work with.
good,Excellent company to work for and great culture.  The people are very friendly and work well together in my experience.  I would recommend working for Duke Energy.
good,"fun place to work.was a good learning experience.The staff  there were very helpful to junior Dba,s.I will certainly love to work there again.i will recommend anyone to work there."
good,Great place to co-op and be mentored. Most plants are shutting down. Like all places-has good eggs and bad eggs. Allowed me to afford college.
good,This was my part time job during my high school year and it was a great company to work for.  I had never worked before and this company showed me what to expect in the real world once I finished up my senior year.
good,"I can build lasting relationships that holds together the functioning of teams, partnerships and management. I also have the ability to inspire and motivate others to perform at their best. I do step-in for my boss ones in a while and have led my team on various occasions. I also conduct job training for new employees."
good,"Fossil Hydro Operations(FHO) role is to connect all Duke Energy business processes and functions to enable and promote a closed loop business process."
good,Worked with a group of great Professionals in the everyday tasks of creating electricity at Duke Energies Fossil Plants. Lead a team of contract designers in several Emerson Controls Projects. Was self motivated with my Boss only calling meetings once a month with our team. Hardest part of the job was working in extreme heat when around the boilers.
good,Good company to work for.  I was hired as a part time employee and needed full-time employment . So I left for that reason. amily oriented company.
good,"Thorough procedures and guidelines enable employees to operate in a safe and productive environment.  Documents, communications, and daily meetings provide necessary information to begin and end the work day/week.  As a power production facility, alternate work schedules may apply."
good,Working with great team. Learned many new testing tools. Management is good. Had good team associates. This company help you grow
good,starting calls at 930 am take a 15 min then a 30 min taking calls and being able to assist customers and if not escalate the calls to a supervisor then having calls monitors and average hold time and on hold calls all my performance is 95% in the green for satisfaction. Made yearly bonus for my stats.  Helping customers to make sure they are satisfied and happy.
good,"Great hours,which fits my schedule,my immediate supervisors are very helpful and the site director is visible. My co-workers are wonderful team members. They are willing to help when needed."
good,Great Organization! I would highly recommend working here. Great Company culture. No more to say here really over and out.
good,"Had good results improving equipment reliability which the management had acknowledged. An example is had to use my expertise in avoiding a catastrophic steam turbine/generator failure, instrumental in solving a boiler feed pump failure and a boiler feed pump motor tripping issue. Good relationship with maintenance management and craft."
good,"work hard"
good,"Structured environment"
good,"Great Company, wished I could get in as a full time. New company to area."
good,"Research and analyze the (peak) capacity, transmission, 12 months usage, and demand for Commercial and Industrial customers, by pulling data from 9 different sources (depending on the region). "

good,"Calculated pipeline daily imbalances, schedule and confirm natural gas volumes on each pipeline bulletin board,  I enjoyed working with my fix co-workers.   Liked not being micro-managed.  Meeting all the pipeline deadlines times each day was very stressful."
good,"show up, tail gate, recieve work order sign pre jobs. get material start job, finish job. safety first."
good,This is a great company with grounded values. Many people have spent their career working for the company but they're also open and accommodating to newcomers and different points of view. Tone at the top is positive and supportive and they genuinely seem to care about their employees.
good,Duke Energy has a great laid back culture. They are a utility company so they are obviously not bleeding edge when it comes to technology. The workforce is aging so that leaves little opportunity for younger employees to get to senior and manager positions.
good,"I was only here for a short time since it was a co-op position. I enjoyed the work I did, the people I worked with, and working downtown."
good,A typical day at Duke Energy would include a wide variety of tasks such as:
good,"A typical day at work is unstressful. My energy for taking phone calls in a call center environment or directly speaking to customers is unwavering. I learned throughout my customer service experience that customer service is vital to a successful company. Management and co-workers go hand in hand with the overall work environment which is usually up to par. The hardest part of the job is not knowing the answers, so training is very vital. Most enjoyable part of a job is knowing that you helped someone who needed you."
good,"Safety culture was top notch, teamwork was stressed.  Workplace culture had changed considerably since I started, it had improved greatly.  Worklife balance was good depending on your manager."
good,"Demanding mentally and physically"
good,"My department during Progress Energy was amazing. A place of growth and opportunity. As the company grew, the work became more intense and harder to get all the work done in the time it was required. "
good,"Working for Duke was a great experience. It was my first call center experience, coming from a long trajectory of face-to-face customer service. The people are good, and the job is easy. Only thing I did not like too much was the last minute mandatory overtime when bad weather was forecasted, and the storm modes."
good,This is a great place to work at I had fun working there and I wouldn't mind working back there and you once again maybe in the future growing environment great people
good,nice hours work four days a week ten hour shifts
good,"Overall, good place to work. Culture varies from one business unit to another, and many decisions are left to local management. Very competitive and looks favorably on workaholics, but doesn't punish those who just put in required time. Compensation is excellent, benefit package pretty good."
good,"I started my career at Duke Energy. It was a great place to learn and grow. The company prepared me for other job opportunities. For the most part, if you desire a safe and stable environment, this is a great place to work. If you are interested in constant opportunity challenges and substantial financial growth, this is not the ideal organization."
good,"Enjoy working with Duke Energy."
good,"The people at Duke were helpful, friendly and caring.  The hours were decent for a work/life balance,  Safety was a large concern there, which was great.  Weekly safety meetings were very informative."
good,"Positive experience overall, good compensation, good team worked cohesively. "
good,Great company to work for......stock options available.....union company....medical care physicians in-house......overtime opportunities with yearly safety bonuses. Great training
good,"I love working here, I just feel that with the org changes taking place, it is difficult to advance within the company.  I believe in a few years that this will get better, but for now, it is difficult to wait out."
good,"I like working for Duke-Energy.  The work is good and new network projects are always coming up.  Good place to learn."
good,"working with this company has provided me a lot of opportunities to learn new things, and everybody is very open for new creative ideas, and help you in achieving your vision."
good,"A typical work day was 7-4."
good,"Jog assignment & safety meeting. Worked with experience group keeping the power plant available & running. Was the Hazardous Waste Technician, and Journeyman Mechanic-Welder. Did Hazardous Waste inspecting's and daily reports. Mechanical-Welding repairs. The hardest part of job was working around the clock to complete critical outage repairs. I rally enjoyed the people, work environment and the various types of work."
good,"Diverse learning environment and highly knowledgeable employees.  I learned many things about power generation and distribution, material composition and mechanical integrity."
good,"Starting out in the mailroom and doing data entry, I was allowed upon my own request to advance to areas outside of the general accounts payable procedures. Co-workers were friendly and always willing to train and answer questions when in need. Management made a point to be transparent and staff meetings to keep employees up to date were frequent. Being selected to train new employees and work on a large integration project was a huge morale boost."
good,Worked here 39 years doing various positions.   Good place to work.  Management is fair.  Co-workers were great.  Great teamwork.
good,Duke Energy is undergoing many good changes that will make it a more flexible and competitive company.  The values of the company are about safety and respect.  It is easy to be a team player here and there is much tacit knowledge amongst the employees who have seen the business grow and change
good,"While contracting at Duke, I have increased my skill level by adding to my knowledge of Microsoft Word, and also being exposed to the use of Sharepoint and Maximo. I feel supported by my managers and my co-workers. I don't think any part of my job is particularly hard, it just requires a bit of juggling sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job is the level of confidence in my abilities I receive from my managers."
good,Duke Energy is a great place to work because i'm able to help others with solving problems they may have with their billing issues or help with getting their service started for their new home.
good,"great values and great people. cons: short lunches, everyone starts at entry level, pay is low"
good,"I enjoyed my position, but I had to leave because of the commute uptown. I worked as a contractor. The pay was great and my project was interesting. My coworkers were friendly and knowledgeable"
good,Nice place to work with a lot of very good people. A typical day at work can be very challenging and fast pace which made it rewarding to work there. Benefits are great.
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company but higher up management is not understanding at all. They do provide trucks, hotels, gas cards, and per diem that is fair."
good,"The environment is solid and you have a lot of freedom with what you'd like to do. There's a lot of diversity in my coworkers, but there still remains a great understanding and camaraderie among them. The engineering work starts pretty easy and you ramp up over time. The regional HQ has a whole floor of recreational getaway stuff like a decent gym, walking track, pool table, self serve convenience kiosk, PS4's, big TV's, corn hole, ping pong, etc. Even as an intern, we were paid well and got to work on real-world assignments."
good,"Duke is a good employer."
good,"This is a great company with many employees about to retire, causing a number of openings. Duke really takes care of its employees with amazing insurance and benefit plans. Very protective and foresightful focusing a lot on safety and procedure."
good,Enjoyable environment with great hours and job work/life balance. Manage was positive and fun but also serious. I learned how to work at a more efficient and timely matter.
good,"Have had opportunities to manage several career changing, skill enhancing projects but that is not the norm. You're assigned to a department (generation, transmission, customer) and that's where your focus lies. Company is in the midst of an Agile transformation (of which I agree and support) but the traditional PM role will phase out."
good,"I have worked Duke Energy's nuclear sites for a while, however, I moved from a site to the GO recently.  The culture in the corporate office is very different but the people are really nice.  My job is pretty easy and routine as the pace here is a lot slower yet there are challenges that pop up from time to time.  I have a great manager and the group I assist is very laid back too.  There is room for advancement and we have the option of working several different schedules, 5 8s, 4 10s, 4 9s and a 4.  The PTO, health insurance and other benefits are fairly decent as well."
good,I left Duke in 2007 for a voluntary layoff package. I decided to go back to school and get a degree in the Medical Billing field. Still very fond of the family that I had while at Duke.
good,The company is very solid.Employee are treated with respect. Management positions are very demanding. You have to take your job and the wellbeing of those under you direction very seriously. Safety is the number one priorty.
good,"It was pleasure working with Duke Energy. Have gained great skills, Very good facilities and health insurance. Managment will take care of each employee.......!!"
good,Job is very challenging and the atmosphere is very great. Employees work with each other well and help each other out with out hesistation. The most enjoyable part of this job is the on the spot recognition.
good,"Every morning I walk into the building, everyone gives a warm smile of hello's.  When all seems lost in a busy days work, I can find comfort in the acknowledgment of my management and colleagues who try to make each day as pleasant as the next.  Though we may not seem to converse at times due to the workloads on our hands, the breaks we take away from the computer screens are used to revitalize our work day energy through sharing personal and professional, previous and current, experiences, with one another.  At Duke Energy I learned many things about the company, of which the most important is you have to be ready to learn new things, and at a consistent rate.  Each job duty is related to another, so error's should be minimized to zero for an ease of flow and communication within departmental team members, or inter-departmental teams.  Lastly, you have to openly accept each new task or job duty, and be ready to take on all the complexity of challenges, it makes the learning process much faster, and finding the answers easier.  Whether between co-workers, departments, or between me and my superiors, communication is the key; and that's what team work is about."
good,A typical day at work includes invoicing and managing communications for the team. I have learned how to be a self-sufficient and facilitate large meetings. The management is helpful and co-workers are pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to balance work and life.
good,Enjoyed working in the Performance Improvement area.  Management showed great commitment to improving the performance in their area and was very supportive in my efforts to help them achieve their goal.
good,"Great place to work. Benefits are great. One of the few companies to still have a pension, for now. Job security is very good."
good,Reasonable requirements and good support for work expected. I became ill and had to leave employment unexpectedly and my position was filled by another before I could return to employment. Understandable.
good,Interned there for 3 months. everyone was very helpful and taught me a lot. Managers would help me find different projects and allowed me to see different aspects of the business.
good,"A good place to work. Good people. Challenging opportunities to help you grow and succeed.  Safety conscious work teams methodically  plan work to assure task are complete with no injuries, environmental impact or loss of equipment."
good,"Great company in general; but must be in the right circles or know the right people to advance. For example, if you aren’t part of the controlling company previously in any joint venture, you will be passed over for advancement if you are Duke Legacy. Examples include when Duke and Cinergy merged, all the previous Cinergy people took leadership roles and opportunities from Duke Legacy employees. Then when the Progress Energy merger happened, they took leadership and advancement opportunities from Duke Legacy employees."
good,I've had great experiences with management for the most part. The people are great to work with. It's a very collaborative and supportive environment too.
good,My day started at 7:00a.m sharp and ended normally no later that 5:00 p.m. The work in my department was very fast paced due to deadlines and corporate oversite and regulatory oversite.  The benefits that this company provide was above average.
good,Good apprentiship program and good advancment opportunities. The company stays abreast of the latest in industry standards and safety proceedures.
good,Duke Energy is a great place to work. Benefits would be hard to beat. The schedule that we work there is not very family friendly.
good,Talking with customers on the phone for 10hrs and learned how to save energy and electricity. The management was available to help and my co-workers was great and the hardest part was leaving because of personal reasons. The most enjoyable part s that everyone looked out for each other.
good,It was a home away from home because at this call center it was small. Customer service was challenging at times but once you learn it was good. Promotions was not hard.
good,"Interaction with all levels of employees at the facility makes the job rewarding and interesting.  Duke rewards dependability, initiative and excellent job performance."
good,Duke Energy is a good place to work. Not enough compensation for the amount of work you have to do and they put you on a one year probation. Management and employees are great.
good,"The reason I left this job is to stay in texas and work instead of being a freelance. This company is a good company to work for if you are a contractor or a freelance type of person. Sometimes you have a job, sometimes you do not have a job."
good,"It was a great place to work when I was there. The hours were fixed, but reasonable. My manager was awesome and was an outstanding teacher. The only thing I dis liked was the lunch time. only 30 mins"
good,"Honestly when I first started in general it was an okay place to work but then it began to unfold why the turnover rate was so high . Poor management , poor pay and poor treatment ."
good,Having the ability to help others when their utilities and other rewarding services. This place real understands that you have a family outside of the work place
good,"Contract employee, 2 years. estimating unit based system, negotiated with contractors."
good,I work with a diverse background of folks that have experience in different areas of IT which makes the team work together nicely. Each member of the team provides valuable input and works with each other to ensure others are trained and up-to-date with the latest information needed to complete the tasks at hand.
good,"Duke Energy from 2019 a present "
good,"Great place to work but very demanding on your personal life especially during hurricane season. great pay, benefits, and lots of overtime available. The money is great but the job itself is very stressful and repetitive."
good,Great people to with and for in an atmosphere to learn as well as promote your skill-set. There are many third party vendors and onsite applications that create a customized SharePoint environment.
good,A typical work day in residential solution is fast pace. Ive learned a lot about the energy and solutions business. The management team is AWESOME from the upper to lower. They really take care of their employees. One of the biggest plus.
good,i enjoyed being outside and in the community and meeting new people everyday. BEING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY  help you learn how to interact with different types of people
good,Duke is really focused on the customer and is in process of positively transforming the customer's experience by incorporating more digital capabilities.  Duke is a leader among their peers.
good,"Like with any large organization there is too much bureaucracy which slows everything down - it's standard corporate America, but it's still a nice a place to work."
good,Nice and I cant complain.I have been treated well I thi company.They are heavy on customer service as am I.I can work for this company over and over again.
good,"Great people and great benefits. Collaborative working environment. Flexible hours, remote working arrangements, team oriented. Good culture. Loved the variety in my work."
good,"it was a new learning experience, that was productive and fun. I had a chance to work long hours and find out what my dad does at his job also. I plan on getting another job with them soon if i can."
good,"worked in data entry most of the day.  posted jobs openings, collected applicant data, assessed applications, presenting them to hiring mgt.  learned to prepare and conduct employee recognitions"
good,Stared morning time (safety meeting)  clean and friendly people   work professional safely  and quality  they take time to do the task  safe and professionalismo
good,Its a fun place to work. One can improve their skills for carer advancement.The company gym is a stress buster for many employees. I love to work for the company again
good,This company truly cares about their employers. They respect them and try to accommodate them as much as possible. They provide great benefits and good pay.
good,The job was incredible and I miss it as well as all the wonderful people I worked with.  The employees ranged in ages from freshly out of college to retirement age from different cultures.
good,This is a great place to work I was just reallyy seeking better opportunity. I would suggest someone to work here. Keep in mind it is in a busy area of town. Traffic can be a issue at times.
good,Great company with good people to work with. What I learned if you don't know need help with something just ask. they have good information sessions.
good,"A typical day for me starts at 6:00 a.m. Work weeks are Monday through Thursday, which is nice. I learned new computer programs. Management was awesome. Co-workers, well... They're co-workers. The hardest part of the job is leaving my 3 month old son at home to come here. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely have to be the few co-workers who make it fun."
good,It's OK. I like the people. The Florida team is excellent. Managers are good. I'm not sure what happens in the company headquarters in North Carolina.
good,"Work as contractor with few benefits.  The job is satisfying and I enjoy coming in every day. Training could be a bit more specialized for the position, but experienced people are always willing to guide new employee. Safety is a lifestyle at Duke not just a sign on a wall."
good,my first job and i loved it. the job was very hands on and so structured. my co workers were amazing they were team oriented . safety was first and foremost
good,"Customer service is a vital necessity in any company, however with an electric company I think it is even more vital. At Duke Energy I worked with not only electric customers but also with gas customers in Ohio. So, all emergency calls were directed to Indiana. Then I was promoted into the training department inside of the Call Center which I absolutely loved because I was getting to guide and train new hire respresentatives. I looked forward to my job every day and not many people can say that. However, my position was moved to Charlotte. So, after Duke I had to go back to the restaurant industries that I was use to. I decided not to settle on just any position or customer service position because I have to much to offer. So, i hope I am able to meet the right employer for me because I would make and excellent candidate and and employee for them."
good,The company was amazing to work for mostly because of the employees and the management. Herm Brames was my personal boss and he was very knowledgeable.
good,"Worked up until birth of my second child.  Quit to be stay at home mom."
good,Was great place to work great people and fun activities typical day at work was answering calls and speaking with great people learning alot about different areas of the Information technology field like working in active directory and creating group policy the only problem i had with this job was the drive to and from it was a very long drive for me and unfortunatly for me there was no option to work from home
good,"Love what I do. Learning new things everyday. My co-worker are nice.  They are funny, nice and caring."
good,"Love working at Duke, lots of opportunity, good co-workers, good management"
good,"Duke Energy takes great care of their customers and employees. They have a great work environment that is easy to immerse yourself into, that makes all employees comfortable in their environment."
good,I enjoy working here.  I am leaving due to decommissioning of the crystal river nuclear plant.
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot about myself. Great Management, Great life work balance, Great co-workers"
good,"Duties included Recruiting for Fossil/Hydro Stations and Nuclear Stations located in North and South Carolina; Trainer for all EEI job related tests.  Duties included training new Staffing employees and Test Administrators all over the Duke Energy system (mid-west to east coast) in how to administer various Edison Electric Institute tests used by Duke for particular positions; administered test to applicants for open positions within Duke.   Developed/ maintained all reports showing statistics for the Staffing group which included gathering information from other parts of the company that pertain to the cost of hiring new employees.

good,"Fun-filled, energetic, vibrant place to work. Filled with caring and considerate employees. The management it great, strong communication skills, employee care and consideration is a top priority."
good,One of the bet jobs I ever had. Have nothing bad to say about the company.
good,Enjoyed a variety of duties.
good,"Duke Energy was an excellent company for which to work. I learned many skills in high-voltage maintenance of electrical service equipment. I found my job interesting and enjoyable and was able to work in a shop environment and in outside service field environments (North Wilksboro, NC to Durham, NC). I worked with dedicated co-workers and management always trained us well in our job skills. We also had excellent management trainining on teamwork and safety which was continually ongoing. The hardest part of the job was enduring the elements outside at electrical substations during extreme weather conditions (sub-freezing temps. during winter and extreme heat during summer). The most enjoyable part of the job was repairing and solving mechanical problems on circuit breakers and seeing the finished product that I had accomplished - along with the knowledge that I was providing a critical service to the public (electricity), and that gave me a sense of pride in my work."
good,Enjoyed my time at Duke Energy working on a short-term temporary assignment would definitely recommend if your looking for a stable company with good benefits.
good,Work there 32 years in different departments.  Encouraged learning new skills. Good benefits.  Due to company downsizing I am losing my job.  I have learned a wealth of knowledge at Duke.
good,"Duke Energy is big on safety and how to be safe every where.  I've learned a lot about meters, kwh, broken blocks and how to concatenate.  The work life balance is very evident"
good,"Would work there again. Lots of exciting projects going on. Was well liked. Did my work, often bringing it home in the evenings and weekends. Was paid well and appreciated."
good,"Duke is a great company to work for and proven to be a secure job.  During an outage, the pressure is high and you don't always have much free time.  Upper management is very good, but lower level management has a lot to be desired."
good,"Great pay but no room for advancement unless you know someone or are an Engineer. Too many changes, just for the sake of changing. Some Sr Managers not open to dissenting opinions."
good,There are lots of projects but little time to plan.  There are not enough resources. Many times the project would be late due to limited resources.  Fast pace but little planning is done due to time constraints
good,Hard to leave this place but so many great friends were made and experiences I'll never forget.  Major Projects project controls group was growing into an amazing group of great people.
good,"Busy every day. Worked 12 hour shifts sometimes 14 hours.Worked swing shifts."
good,"Excelente experiencia laboral, aunque solo estuve poco tiempo espero poder regresar a la empresa"
good,Great place to work but rotating shift requirements not very family friendly
good,Duke is one the most enjoyable places I have ever worked. The management and coworkers were very easy to work for and with. There was a deep sense of family here at all times and at all levels.
good,Construction environment; good management allowing for ability to do your job with little interference.  Good project that will be protective of environment in longer term.
good,"Great company just a lot of employees issues of working with others was a big problem. A lot of inputting information on a timely bases. I felt my job title should of been what it was instead given to a male which should had been doing my job, just management some personal issues I did not like."
good,friendly enviorment great people. I enjoyed meeting new people even though it can be very challenging at times. the main goal is to stay focused on the task at hand.
good,"a seasonal worker. we got called to outages and projects awesome place to work, you learn a lot about coal plants, coal yard, operations, maintenance  wish they had more projects going on"
good,Good place to work. Team members good...i liked working here. It was a physically demanding job in all types of weather. Work life balance wasnt very good.
good,I enjoyed my job at the nuclear plant. It was structured and very clear on job responsibilities and performance expectations. Safety was a priority.Everyone that I worked with was extremely helpful and friendly.
good,"Management at Duke Energy is strong. They are forward thinking concerned about the infrastructure and the impact of what the current status will be look like in 5, 10, even 20 years down the road. Management works to bring the best people on board to help manage the resources needed to ensure a continued commitment to supply its customers with the energy demand of the future."
good,"a typical work day including reading emails from customer and responding appropriately in regards to electric service, contacting customers via emails, faxes and phone calls"
good,"A busy office with a lot of opportunity available.   A typical daily/weekly events in a busy office environment would be typing invoices, answering phones, input time for payroll, assembling reports, setting up training and completion of training, weekly activity report, new vendor setup, meeting/conference setup, travel setup."
good,"The pay was great compared to what i made at my previous job. WE could get a lot accomplished but it could get really loud at times. When unexpected situations come about such as sickness of myself or my child, management was not understanding of that at all. Also our call center was not vintalated so that caused a lot of drifting sickness throughout the center and it's occupants for the winter months."
good,I like working for this company. I would recommend them as an employer. The people are professional and personable. I am a contractor and will definitely accept a permanent role if it is offered.
good,"A typical day is to check with night supervisor on job progression or completion. Attend daily meeting for job assignments, work to complete jobs as assigned, enter job remarks into work management computer system.  Be available for on call duty when assigned."
good,"I’ve only worked at Duke Energy for a short period of time. I worked with them through Eastern Personnel and I liked the job it’s just I was given a lot of off time. I would polish silverware, wash dishes , just clean all night and prepare food . I figured housekeeping or working at a hotel would be better because of the hours and I have cleaning experience."
good,The job was amazing and I hoped every day they would tell me I was hired on full time.  The benefits offered and the vacation time was excellent.  However I was a contract worker and never experienced that first hand
good,"It is a very good place to work, working under Duke Power and not a contractor was a lot nicer treated fairly by management. everyone got along did there job and finshed outage in timely manner."
good,"Lots of good people to work with.  Management sometimes promotes and hires people who have no experience in the job they are filling.  Some management people have no people skills yet they expect cooperation and want employees to ""do whatever it takes"" to get job done for them.  They have good benefits, a fitness center on site, and good support people in the Administrative offices.  The work/life balance can be good at times when communication exists between management and employees, however, sometimes plans have to be cancelled with little or no advance notice to employees causing hardships and scheduling issues for employees home life with their spouse and children's care. Overall, the company is a good place to work because it pays well and has good benefits.  Corporate Headquarter employees are like most CEO's and upper management; decisions are made with little or no knowledge of work required to produce the product."
good,"Arrive at work at 6:30 am in the morning, open computer, check emails and respond accordingly and make necessary phone calls if needed. Then I open up all applications that I use to begin working on my projects to analyze data and update to get reports out in a timely manner. "
good,"Providing customer service to residential and non residential customers that required energy in North/South Caroling and the Midwest. Skills gained here was expert customer service.

good,"Receive incoming calls, from energy customers utilizing SAP software. Receive payment, setup restore, new customer service and disconnect also established customer payment arrangement. Promoted to team lead"
good,"Excellent company to work for - benefits and pay good, expectations high, value and culture tops."
good,"The best place to work. Not recommended for someone with small children. Bonuses galore. Counselors on site. Gym, full kitchen, and shower-sleep lounge for employees."
good,Very busy work environment with great leadership and the opportunity to learn many skills. They focus heavily on safety and although Duke is a large company it has a small business feel with a family oriented enviroment
good,Management could be improved.. Parking was an issue. Call center technology could be upgraded to allow for real time adjustments . The cafeteria food was too expensive.
good,Most days were filled with busy work and you learn to be precise. Management is understanding about deadlines and the culture is to be helpful with coworkers. The hardest thing is to leave an unfinished project until the next day. The best part of the job was being helpful to customers.
good,Good people but requires Sr level to execute well. There is not much supervision which is fine if you know what you are doing and are good self manager.
good,"Good company overall. It would help if the contact center had an actual restaurant or so. Also, it would be beneficial to offer better schedules or opportunities for advancement."
good,"I've been on many projects a Duke Energy as a consultant/contractor. As long as you do your job, your efficient and work well with the employees you'll always be called back."
good,Duke energy is a great place to work with many benefits and opportunities. The only drawback to this company is advancement. Aside from that I enjoy working here and recommend it to anyone.

good,"Good place to work, great people with outstanding benefits. Work to home life ratio is excellent and management really seems to care about workers. Contractors are treated the same as full time employed workers."
good,"great place to work! management was great, coworkers were ok, really relax work setting never stressed, only wish the contract was longer, they dont seem to extend contracts"
good,Everyday at work was a new day with full of challenges and excitements in projects. I learnt a lot about DC system and relevant  procedures to process projects.I had friendly behavior with co-workers. The hardest part of job has been solved professionally by consulting and study.
good,great people.great project. People skills improved. Great Manager
good,I am a Project Manager/ designer with 14 years combined Experience at Duke Energy And AEP. I like to manage projects and see them to a successful completion.
good,I enjoyed the work/life balance. Nice gym. Everyone in the building always seemed very helpful and welcoming. I was only her as a contract so it may be a different experience for permanent employees.
good,"Duke is a great place to work. It is a utility, so there is constant budget pressure and regulatory pressure. In general, great people working hard to do the right thing for rate paying customers."
good,"Enjoyed my time with Duke Energy, the people were great to work with. Gave me the knowledge to get my job done well. Worked in different departments before finishing as a Measurement Analyst, Management was always there for you no matter what your need was. Great team work with fellow employees."
good,"I worked as a contractor for a fixed term of one year. Great place to work, as they are always striving for excellence in technology and ready to spend money on R&D."
good,"If I could do it all again I would have transferred out when I had the chance and had the opportunity to advance in the company. Everything was great, job, duties, training for my position, advancement opportunities."

good,"Great place to work ,good compensation, I'm provided a company vehicle and have a flexible work schedule and have four weeks vacation 11 holidays all good"
good,This was the best oppurinity I have had in my career. I loved working here they gave me the full responsibility and support to manage the project. I took over the project after employed a new staff and made the deadline and completed within the new budget.
good,most of the time you really don't do anything at all. It usually takes about an hour to accomplish your daily goals. You basically sit around after that until it is time to go home.
good,"Very safety conscious, procedure driven workplace. Just have to follow the rules. Plenty of help and oversight if needed to perform any maintenance activities. Various groups work well together."
good,"Love working for Duke, with flex time and other support from management."
good,"Call center work."

good,A typical day begins with my morning managers prepare and share the days workload numbers and perform a stand up meeting with the 8:00am staff. We have a wide variety of schedules so we have staff coming in as late as 8:45am. The supervisors touch base and plan any set activities or functions for the day. The supervisors each have an area they specialize in so they go right to task. I usually have to do's left over and work on those and take on anything else that comes my way. The entire management team takes complaint or angry customer calls as well as answer technical questions. This fills in any down time.

good,"Completed 3 co-op rotations at Duke in their environmental department with a focus on air emissions. Looking back on my co-op rotations I would have benefited more by co-oping at more of an industrial setting however these rotations helped sharpen my soft skills which are very important. Working in a cubical all week long and staring a computer screen can be dull but I kept myself amused with all of the reporting projects I was given. Nearly all of my coworkers were stationed outside of Cincinnati and our team communicated remotely. However, each and everyone one of the team members were extremely friendly and helpful. I felt I was excellently treated and appreciated which made going to work that much more enjoyable. However, the real base fundamentals of the job were just number crunching and spreadsheet analysis and not any real engineering work. I never had the opportunity to connect anything that I learned in the class room. While working in this role I got a real taste for what environmental work was really like. I learned quite a bit about all of the regulations that both state and federal government impose on any entity that releases anything into the environment. I experienced first hand the kind of rigorous detail utility companies have to provide in order to prove that their power plants and emission sources are in spec with both federal and state regulations."

My management has been supportive, knowledgeable,and very attentive to work/life balances.
