bad,I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone  the supervisors are really fake say one thing and mean another and treat people like idiots and the jobs are so mundane
bad,Management is horrible and unorganized.  Raises and career ladder are very unclear and discouraging.  Pay is low for the work you have to do and the chemicals you have to deal with. They have no respect for their people. To them you are very replaceable.  No value
bad,"Got hired through Kelly Services to work at Pall Aerospace.  I received a week of ""training"" by shadowing a worker who had been there for only 6 months, the managers then immediately tried to move me into the ""high volume cell"" which moves at a much faster pace and consists of two jobs in one. Most of the days there isn't enough work to do so you have to ask others to share jobs or stretch out any work that you do have just to get through the shift. You sit in an old, hard, uncomfortable chair or stand throughout the day and are able to listen to headphones, but with the lack of work most days and the repetitiveness of the job it is incredibly boring and draining, though the fumes, loud machines and cutting your fingers help to keep you awake. The managers, if you can call them that seem to just sit around and socialize the entire shift or aren't really around. I had messed up an order once and a worker from the prior shift talked to me about it on the managers behalf instead of the manager himself. After about a month's time I received a call from my Kelly recruiter that my service with Pall has been terminated, when I asked why he told me the managers had sent an e-mail over the weekend saying I was messing up too many parts and refused to work in other areas. Now not once had I been asked to work in another station and not once did a manager talk to me directly or help me if I actually was messing up parts. Overall it felt very sneaky and strange, I truly think that they didn't have enough work to keep the new people on or they didn't like that I wouldn't work overtime every"
bad,Pall/ Danaher Corporation has no leadership. They treat employees poorly. The work load is unbearable. Employees get little respect or compensation for their efforts.
bad,"Hostile workplace. Only concerned about share holders, machines are out dated, and in disrepair. Safety violations are regularly ignored. Holiday vacations revoked. Mandatory overtime. A rotten place to work, with no future."
bad,Worked part time for this company. Rude and unprofessional.  No respect between employees and management. Employees have no respect for each other.  Employees do what they want! Needs Management to step up to the plate and Manager each department. HR really needs to get involved and resolve many issues.
bad,"Micro management, complex management structure and most managers are fighting for their existence at Pall. High staff turn over due lots of changes. focusing on agressive selling and lost their status of solution provider."
bad,"Purging previous years' invoices to make room for the current years' invoices,  placing purged invoices  in alpha/numeric order, placing them in the archives. Training for SAT was sporadic, some coworkers were memorable."
bad,"Reviewed workorder variances, monitored scrap, earned labor hours, costed new products, and attended daily manufacturing meetings."
bad,"You have to be desperate to work at this site. Management has been trained to threaten employees. Has good ole boys (dead wood) in mid to upper levels in all departments that stay there forever. They don't do their jobs on time, so everyone under them are under high pressure to meet the contract deadlines. Results in mass overtime with no extra pay (exempt), threats from management that you'll get fired, false promises, no advancement cause dead wood has clogged system, no real raises, no respect. Do not try to make a career at this PALL site. Stay until you get some experience and move on like everyone else."
bad,this is the sorryiest place I have ever worked.  the last day I was there the plant manager matt stiner tried to attack me as I was quiting. I filled a complant with management they took no action. I was shown more respect in prison.  must be nice.
bad,Manager plays favorites has no idea what is going on on the production floor. I worked hard never called in or was late was let go for no reason at all other than the fact the manager has no clue what is going on. I talked to other long time employees there they all say he is the problem. This is the reason the place always has job openings.
bad,"Small and busy office, with very little best practices in place.  Known to be highly political, with a large amount of nepotism.  Manager seems like he doesn't want the job and is generally incompetent.  "
bad,"The company is not really good at giving out rewards.  If you save the company a lot of money, you will only get a ""thank you"".  Leadership lacks.  A lot to do about people who can self-promote and not produce."
bad,"If all you want is mandatory overtime and loss of winter shutdown due to management keeping an impossible production schedule. Then this is the place for you. I have never been in a company that thought so badly of management, that the day I started training I was told to run as fast as I can and never look back."
bad,"Poor management structure, lack of organizational clarity. No defined mission objectives or path ways for sucess."
bad,"I worked for the company via an agency, as this is the only route in for an operator job."
bad,"Pall est d√©sormais un ex leader de la filtration"
bad,"This is hands-down the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"This is honestly the worst company with the worst management I have ever worked for. They hire more than deplorable candidates and show the good workers no respect. If you like required overtime with little to no notice, schedule changes with little to no notice, negligent management, immature/ catty employees, low salary, and overall poor working environments, then Pall is the place for you."
bad,"Media location like Hauppauge,Putnam,Pensacola FL are under very poor management.Like Hauppauge turn around rate above 25% in year. Be ware of these location."
bad,"Pall Corporation has well below average compensation despite the experience, education, and performance of the employee. I spent 9 years as a full time employee with the company and my final pay was only a few dollars more than the pay temporary employees receive, despite having multiple degrees, vast experience, and a proven track record. There was near universal consensus among other employees that the compensation was sub par as well."
bad,"This Place is a Joke! They only hire people without experience. A typical work day is watching everyone walk around and gossip. you are not trained properly. Management have their favorites, and have no idea what they are doing. Co-workers are Phony. The hardest part of the job was not getting rewarded for your hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I left. Well since they just sold the place I'm sure it will not last to much longer. Good Luck!"
bad,"I was appalled at the lack of accountability here in NPR.  There's a lack of urgency and alot of people that have worked here for 20+ years that actively resist any type of continuous improvement whatsoever. There are meetings about meetings and nothing ever gets better. I feel for the new plant manager because he is trying to change things for the better, but gets resistance at every turn.  "
bad,"When i started with PALL i had a great manager the company was a little dis organised but workable, After Danaher took over the company went to the dog eat dog, Had Managers that did not know anything about customer service, the products or Quality systems You can not trust the HR people  would not recommend this company to others"
bad,"Annual raises are measley and it doesn't matter if you slack off or work hard.  They are the same for just about everyone."
bad,"Poor management.  VP would undermine the manager.  The direct manager know absolutely nothing about the computer language and always needed assistance from his employees.  The department was staffed at 12 when the manager arrived.  There is only 3 remaining employees now.  The majority of the employees who left, had less than a year of service due to the unprofessional style of management that included the VP."
bad,"We knew when the last management team came in from Illinois, they were the closers of our building."
bad,"Really bad management! More of a if your face fits company! Say they are more quality over quantity which is lies, if your caught not working you get in trouble. Promote people without training or family member is a manager. No such thing as confidentially within the senior or management structure as they tell everyone what is going on including operators stuff which should be private. Good pay rates and always overtime even if not correctly trained. People untrained making or testing filters. Pall ilfracombe is a avoid plant."
bad,"My line leader was really nasty towards me, the more I reported it the more he made me look like I was complaining all the time. Since all the line leaders are friends they got rid of me. I even asked to get moved because I was getting bullied but they didn't."
bad,"Parasites (lice, bedbugs), bullying, discrimination, favoritism. Good money. Harmful conditions: cyclohexanone, M.E.K, ethyl acetate (no masks)"
bad,"working there was Horrible they are Racist!!!!!  they tell you the company is doing soooo!! well but when you say anything about more money they change the subject if you voice your opinion about any unfairness you are called a trouble maker   I was a very good worker I came in everyday did overtime "
bad,Worked in shipping 12 hours plus per day no leadership poor moral with employees  you work as a temp for a unlimited amount of time up to 2 years then when you finally do get hired on you dont get a raise until a year later
bad,This company takes advantage of your skill set and the pay is a joke for what they want from you!  Just another company taking advantage of tier employees!
bad,"A Diretoria comercial n√£o faz gest√£o de pessoas, n√£o tem suporte interno para efetuar o trabalho, o vendedor √© respons√°vel por tudo. Quando o vendedor efetua uma grande venda todos querem os m√©ritos, por√©m quando o projeto n√£o √© fechado a culpa √© sempre do vendedor. Uma empresa de vendas, mas o departamento de vendas n√£o √© reconhecida e sempre n√£o tem voz a organiza√ß√£o."
bad,This place is a very hostile environment to work for very stressful how the Manager watches and harasses certain people all the time. You start to become frustrated because its not just the manager you have to worry about also her watch dogs that does her job for her they just don't get paid her salary. And if you have no interest in the managers personal life you automatically become a target. I doesn't feel like work anymore its starting to feel like middle school.
bad,Ambiance tr√®s d√©grad√©e depuis la venue d un nouveau responsable de site il y‚Äôa 5/6 ans
bad,Pall has a habit of acquiring barely surviving companies and then pays employees as poorly as possible. There is no room for advancement. Poor management levels lead to a lot of confusion as there is little cooperation between sites within the company.
bad,"There are suppers that do not know their job. Or the job required to do the jobs safely. They want things done right away not caring about the possible hazards, or the danger that exists.They talk a good game but do not follow through with what should be. ."
bad,"- reduce cost by decreasing staff/increasing workload"
bad,"I develop new membranes or methods out of new materials. In this work, high inventive and technical skills are necessary combined with quick adaption to problems. Additionally, collaboration between groups (chemistry/development) is essential."
bad,"Multinacional com gest√£o de pessoas zero, voltada para a persegui√ß√£o e coa√ß√£o dos colaboradores para atingir resultados, o que s√≥ traz insatisfa√ß√£o e um n√≠vel de estresse improdutivos. N√£o h√° estrutura de apoio ao profissionais trabalhando em campo, turnover alto em todas as √°reas de interface com clientes, falta de investimento em capacita√ß√£o e treinamento."
bad,"I started via a local agency, which is about the only way to get I to the company.  From the start I was treated as an outsider,  being given very minimal training mainly do as I do.  When ( very quickly) left alone the inevitable mistakes occurred and you were then labelled as typical agency, won't last... When I challenged my line leader about the lack of training I was told that it was due to improve soon and don't rock the boat ( ironically one of the company creeds is when in doubt ask!!) Lots of sackings,  many accidents and health and safety violations and staff living in fear of being let go. However if you can deal with intense boredom and being treated like a machine this is the place for you."
bad,Benefits are not that great and the work culture is bad. Employee happiness and morale is not a consideration of the management. Only good for experience to find a better place.
bad,company management  has no concerns with the employee capabilities of performing work of his best and no appreciation of his/her performance.they expect more and more from him/her.
bad,"I was let go after 2 months after being told that the position I was hold was a contract position for 6+ months. I followed the rules, performed exceptionally and they still let me go with even telling me face to face. I had to find out from the agency that they could not ""afford to keep me around any more""."
bad,The management at the time I worked there was more into gossiping that into reaching their goals as a company. Many of the managers were there for long time and were afraid of the majority owners.
bad,"The people at Pall overall are cool to work with.  The Plant Manager is A+. "
bad,"Laid back union shop, paid lunch, terrible benefits, management plays favorites for advancement in career i.e. not a favorite, no promotion. Laid off within 6 months"
bad,I really don't remember the place but things I do remember I would like to forget bit a very clean facility o must say. I really enjoyed the people I met there. God is good and there were a a lot spiritual people their including myself.
bad,"Sommige colega's hebben niet graag nieuwkomers."
bad,"All in all experience wise good, but no growth."
bad,I work in Claris department. Typical day starts out with group meeting to discuss orders back log issue from previous shifts. The days are long  must meet standards for working. Things could be better
bad,"Micro Managed by a bully, my advice is stay far away until they figure out he is the problem - people don't quit the company they quit the manager and this guy is why I quit along with a ton of other managers."
bad,It used to be regular work day. Learn microbiological techniques but experience got limited to filters. management was bad. my coworkers were very good. used to finish work before 5 so little  time to relax at the end of the day.
bad,"cleaning cars in and out"
bad,I am only rating the company a 2 out of 5 as most of my other companies have been far more enjoyable.
bad,"Working at Pall Corp. is fast paced. The style of teaching is time sensitive. It's a very completive environment; however, I'm a fast learner and eager for career advancement  no matter what the environment is."
bad,Was terminated unjustly without investigation. In the process of having the issue investigated from higher ups. I hope the company holds up to its standard and does the right thing. Management needs to be held to higher standards and supervised better.
bad,they couldn't decide where they wanted you to work at so they basically made someone or some people as a floater and learning all the areas but not getting the rate of pay they should be getting and they said that's what the cell applies about the working all different areas but when I wanted to transfer different cells the management wouldn't put in for me he actually put in for himself and somebody else and left me in a most dangerous environment which was working with the chemicals with acid and peroxide 100%
bad,"A typical day at work start explaining what have been done in the past day and reviewing what is required to accomplish during the day. I have learned to prioritize and work in a multitasking manner, the management may be available when needed or may not, the co-workers are very kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job is accomplish all the task required during the day as multiple task are only made by one person from the group. The most enjoyable part of the job are the environment, the co-workers are very close to each other so it is great to work with them."
bad,People work hard but are not noticed.  All they care about is making the numbers no matter what !!!  Very Poor management!!!  Left because of manager I had!
bad,The company is good in manufacturing but can do a better job with culture and work-life balance.
bad,"Pall Corporation is a great company with very competitive compensation packages. Excellent place to learn from the medical device industry and familiarize with ISO, FDA standards."
bad,"In pall i was conducting filter validation studies like product wet integrity, extractable,adsorption,compatibility.THen ordering of raw materilas, solvents etc, daily updation of log books, calibration of laboratory equipents etc."
good,"Heard so many nice things about what the company USED to do for their employees.. Unfortunately, those days are long gone...."
good,"I have learned how to work under stressful conditions, short deadlines, changing tasks, heavy work load.  Management keeps changing, and being a part of a ""resource pool"" turned my job from meaningful into just being a pair of hands."
good,"This company has to many hand changes n the 10yrs I work there it change ownership six times. Don't advance fairly within show favoritism,no comments about how your job performance is"
good,"General population of the company always seemed like they were always behind in thier deadlines, majority of employees worked from home after hours and on weekends. Definately NO down time- you can easily get burned out."
good,"Job was very challenging,good people to work with,unfortunately the trainning process was not as well planned to get the best quality out of each employee"
good,"Typical manufacturing shop.   good group of guys, some worked, some slept. Management restructured often, which left everyone running around cause no one knew anything. Promised training to advance and increase pay, never happened. Boss had his favorites, and was a slug."
good,"Pay is ok, however people are always worried being fired for anything wrong. Lots of mandatory overtime, whether you like it or not, you HAVE to be there or you'll be looking for another job soon. Just go in and do your job and that's it. Don't suggest anything, don't try to change anything, don't say anything, they do not like it."
good,Al local level there is too much politics placing quality and customer satisfaction in second place.  Operators show superb commitment to quality and indicators.
good,The turnover at the executive and management here has been less than spectacular with each new team having their own agenda.  They need to have some stability to make this effective.
good,"Bad management, poorly run, corrupt, nepotism , bullying, some pretty horrible folk there trying to get people fired so they can score browny points with the bosses"
good,"Overall good company. Average pay for this type work. Sometimes due to client demands, long hours and weekend work. Large turnover due to job demands vs pay."
good,if union employees and company managers were able to get along without company people trying to run every aspect of the production process into the ground and berating everyone.
good,Constant layoffs. No job security. I have had 3 different job titles. I have worked all three shifts. Management does not treat employees well.
good,"Life sciences line of business does make huge net profit whereas others are just ok."
good,"The pay is pretty good, but the management is terrible. Everything is military style with dictator leadership. The actual job is great. I do like the work, although sometimes it can get repetitive."
good,Loved working for Pall Corporation but the hours everyday we‚Äôre every long some days worked over 10 hours just to get done was was needed for the day. Very fast paced and not organized
good,"I worked at Pall for 5 yrs. In that time I proved myself on many occasions to be above average as a machinist, and a problem solver. I held a lead man position twice in the machine shop in my 5 years employed at Pall, with hopes of moving into supervision, then possibly management. In any role I was employed in at Pall, I carried a lot of influence among my co-workers due to my experience and technical skills. The only problem at Pall, and the reason I left the New Port Richey facility was that the culture of the management was to promote thru friendships, not accomplishment. It was sadly well known that the people that received opportunities, and promotions, were the people closest to the hiring manager of whatever job may have been posted internally. The promotions in that facility were earned outside the work place through personal relationships. Normal for friends of the supervisor or manager, to get the jobs."
good,I have been at pall corporation Since 12-17-12 to percent. I have long a great bit to help my career. Its not the best place to work because of management not holding people accountable for doing wrong. They pick and choose who they like. Everyone is not held to the same standard.  Thanks
good,"Pall Aerospace has everything an Aerospace company desires. Except the inter company politics are out of control. Other than that, it was a great experience."
good,"Under new management and there are a lot of changes going on. It seems like we are just a number."
good,"Setup and running of the machines and the supervisor is immature and coworkers where good to work with and hardest part of job was dealing with the supervisor and most enjoyable was the hours,days and shift and benefits."
good,"Cortland NY, it was a great place to work as far as pay, but management made you feel as if you were nothing. They accused me of being on drugs and a liar."
good,Poor management representation to upper management. Professional support very limited when required. Upward mobility in company is very limited at this site.
good,"Retirement plan, 401K, health insurance, shutdown week in Christmas"
good,Poor management and communication from home office. I liked the travelling and was able to be self directed. 
good,it was areally good job overall there is just no communication at all with you an managers youll never know whats going on unless you hear it from co workers
good,"no room for growth. "
good,"A typical day in Pall is full of surprised no matter you schedule your work week, every day is a surprise since there is no structure in the facilities department."
good,"The job wasn't difficult, but working with a union work force was difficult at times.  There wasn't and communication between the work force and the management, and everything was thrown on the engineers."
good,"‚Ä¢	Traitement et suivi des commandes sur SAP (De la r√©ception √† la livraison au client finale et facturation) en tenant compte des contraintes de transport et de la r√©glementation du pays, diff√©rentes documentations n√©cessaires (EXA, EUR1, B/L, AWB, PL, COO, COC, assurance‚Ä¶)"
good,"Mainly desktop work with no much scientific complexity. Theoretically dubious validation guides and non relevant experimentation. Validation protocols discussed by phone with R&D, poor communication and analysis."
good,"The area had a high turnover rate, and I was the only group leader running two shifts. My day was hardly ever the same, which was fine but the area needed stability. Management meant well but they had no idea what it takes to run the area and a lot of decisions where made off of others. I had some great coworkers and I think the hardest part of the job was the constant changes in hours. The most enjoyable was my coworkers"
good,"They care about numbers - they care about shipments. The Shop is Union the Office is not. The Shop has a contract in-place with excellent benefits, the Office does not. They offer the typical benefits along with 2 weeks vacation and 40 hrs. personal time after the first year. The working conditions at the facility I worked at were old and needed updating. Without a formal education, you will not advance. The Union positions pay more than the office."
good,"Training is non-formal and often inadequate even though there's a training manual to follow. Some trainers are more thorough than others. Sometimes there's forced overtime and holidays taken away on short notice. Typical manufacturing environment. New management making lots of changes. Can be stressful at times as hourly production numbers can be impossible to attain with the quality they're looking for and old, broken down equipment. Average pay for the job. PPE must be worn. There's drama just like everywhere but most people there were nice and very helpful."
good,"I worked 23+ years for this company with lots of opportunity to grow with the company. Due to management changes and restructuring my position was ""eliminated"". Then within 6 months the company sold the business to Danaher.  Many people making good salaries were terminated to groom the bottom line financials to facilitate the sale of the business."
good,I have been able to learn and adquire experience in Pall. I always try to learn from everyone here. Great place to learn about the medical device industry.
good,Expect you to work over bank holidays and weekends. No career advancement and lots of uncertainty around security of jobs. Communication is horrendous.
good,The work in this place is overwhelming but good. You learn to work with diferent levels that clients require in their projects. These projects are used in universities for different experiments.
good,"*Essais aux laboratoires + suivi de r√©unions + lecture biblio et pr√©paration de rapports d'analyses ou r√©daction de modes op√©ratoire."
good,"Pall Corporation demands a professional work environment, and it's employees largely adhere to these standards willingly. Work amenities are well above-average. Stock program, 401k, Health Benefits are all high quality."
good,I enjoyed working for the company although somewhat stressful
good,"The worst part about the job is management. Poor at planning and dealing with changes. Doesn't take advice to well. Not bad if you don't mind having a new boss every year, the office is a rotating door."
good,Pall Corporation is a fast paced company which is committed to its success by employing the best employees. It is a diverse company which impacts the filter industry and notably the leader in its field. It is a good company to test ones ability to add to the constant growth and continued success. People are friendly and work together to achieve goals and become a team to maintain the excellence of quality required to be part of this company.
good,"gros groupe, donc tr√®s impersonnelle."
good,"Pall has been acquired by Danaher in the last few years so the organization is experience integration and some growing pains.  With that said, some of the best talent I have ever worked with in my career."
good,"They hire good people, and they offer great training. Not really a hard job, easy to understand the process of manufacturing."
good,Great people to work with.  Management needs to spend more time cultivating the talent that the company already has available
good,"Typical day in troubleshooting system errors, running HR reports, management of HR data Entry in HCM, Kronos, and DSI.  Making badges"
good,The cortland division of Pall is very unorganized. The production scheduling is not the best and there is often issues with the old machines. overall quite unorganized.
good,"A very good and stable company, friendly work environment. I have all the good things to say about Pall. very nice people and very friendly environment."
good,"A tough place to work in after so many layoffs recently. Do not depend on your hire as a long-term                                          "
good,"The benefits at Pall are very good: healthcare, dental, vision. Benefits  begin the day you start. The office is a clean modern environment. People work Hard,"
good,"Management projects across the USA with a diversity from Engineering to Technology to Production to Laboratory was what made it so exciting.  Inclusive to this was a rainbow of different personalities, all equally engaging. The expeditious pace, momentum, and high expectations in terms of goals and timeliness sets the podium for an intellectual journey."
good,Having good interaction with my colleagues & senior management. Sometimes it becomes streneous during month ends when order number falls short.
good,Working at Pall as a customer service representative is mostly order entry. Every once in a while if a customer has an issue with their order then there will be phone conversations or an exchange of emails.
good,"It is a great place to work, however the company is not really good at  reward employees outstanding performance. To make the situation worse, for the past three years there has been an ongoing organizational restructure with make employees very insecure in terms of job security."
good,Good team with a tenured work force. Good Employee morale. Senior Leadership is very involved in day to day operations.
good,"Great place to work. I learned a lot of skills that will help me with my future. Management team communicates well, but could be better with the directives."
good,"Business is business Pall Corporation is a outstanding Corporation."
good,Fast pace work with heavy machines that curragate pleats in materials to develops industrial filters. Worked with a great group of people. The management style was open and flexible to all.  The hardest part of the day was during inventory checks and the most enjoyable part was when inventory check was completed.
good,Gained exposure to the water filtration / treatment industry.  Co workers were professional.  Management could use a little help (too many things on the plate)
good,"average working place with the correct tools and teaching of job, very safty aware, learned receiving/shipping stocking pulling orders, paper work for shipping (invoices, export paper work)"
good,"busy turnaround place..........................."
good,I do not have review except that they are slow in impacting information. There are many layers of sales force.
good,"Review previous days production and adjusted schedule to compensate for missed production targets. Worked on 4 week rolling sales orders to identify missing components. In 14 months helped reduce past due orders from $5 million to $0 past due. Management was nice but became ""split"" as half of the factory (industrial side) was moving to a different location as the Aerospace side.  My co-workers were great, made the last few weeks ok as fellow associates were being transferred or released.  Hardest part of the job was starting for the company that was new to SAP and did not have any training or procedures for the planning position I took over. Most enjoyable part was helping to reduce past due orders from over $5 million to $0 past due."
good,"high pressure group"
good,"Pick individual material needed for orders so they can be assembled. Inventory ‚Äì control, usage of computer system to print shipping, barcode & box labels. Stocking and maintaining shelves in warehouse.  "
good,Great experience out of college and set up the basics of filtration
good,"Pros"
good,"I've worked as a field specialist, so operating out of the home office when not traveling to client sites. I enjoyed the customer interactions but challenging to build strong field teams considering remote operation. Large corporate structure also presents challenges for cross functional team initiatives."
good,"Benefit not so good"
good,"it is an ok place to work, great benefits but sometimes the overtime is a little too much. supervisors play favorites. short breaks and lunches. some departments have employees who have reached the max pay and those employees dont work likethey should and leave everything up to other shifts."
good,I worked in a microbiology lab where where i validated drugs from pharmaceutical companies for their antibacterial properties. I learned more about microbiology lab than i did in college. I partook in interviews and building the team for the lab. The dynamic between myself and my coworkers facilitated the completion of our assignments. Hardest part of the job is meeting the time framed that has been put in placed while trying to validate a drug that became unpredictable. I enjoyed the company of my coworkers on and off work.
good,"put to a machine for the shift, not aloud to talk to no one while machines are running,"
good,Good advancement opportunitites.  Last several years the company has undergone several management changes which has taken a toll on the work force.  Lack a sustainable direction.
good,Management and coworkers all were willing to train new employees.
good,Learned a great deal of molecular biology techniques. Gained experience with project management.
good,I learned so much in all aspect. The hardest part of the job is work with the people in manufacture area
good,I enjoyed working at Pall. The people are nice.The job was interesting. If not for the continued threat of lay offs it would be a great place.I would still be happy to work there if they called me back from most recent layoff.
good,"-Review schedule for deliveries of manufacture orders as PM."
good,"Great Gig until corporate restricting.  Focus on life science and pharma was a profitable business model, but at the expense of resources and personnel supporting industrial applications."
good,This Job is fast pace non stop better enjoy every moment and  every break you get because this jobs requires your devoted and undivided attention. This Job is fast pace but you have great coworkers and employers who can help you excel in this organization. This job and it's hours takes time to get acclimated to but it's well worth it.
good,a typical work day consists of testing and sampling all of the produced material followed by detailed data entry. hours wold be anywhere from 10 -12 hours and Saturdays.
good,Pall is a good place to work if you are self sufficient and are able to understand dynamics. Not sure what lies ahead for Pall but I suppose it could be good for some.  They have a great work/life balance as long as you do your job.
good,"Very large corporation with deep pockets - as such, salaries are good and benefits can be generous, they even have a retirement benefit in addition to a 401K. On the downside, the company is riddled with company politics. People can be pushy and cut-throat - especially managers. Layoffs and firings are not uncommon. You must be political to progress up the higher ranks."
good,"Gained new skills and knowledge after working for a year. Friendly employees (for the most part). Good management. Well-paid, considering my position. Work may become monotonous after a while, but there was a different task each day, so not too bad."
good,"Its an ok company to start out at. No long term advancement. Pretty standard job,"

I would file away any blue prints or job boards that were pulled out after I had left for the night. I was allowed to redo all the files so that they were more organized and easier to find. I was taught how to properly fold each different size blue print that I ran off and file them in the right folder. I was allowed to order supplies when mine were getting low. I entered new data into the computer when I worked in shipping and receiving. The hardest part of this job was changing out the ammonia that was needed to create the blue prints to make sure that they were readable.
