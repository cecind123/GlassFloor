I have learned how to fit each customer's needs without even thinking about it, which is very cool. The management is unbelievably fantastic. They do everything in their power to make sure their employees are meeting their needs and doing okay, and are honestly the most wonderful people I have ever met. The workplace is like a second family to me, and we all feel that way. There's no negativity within the store. It's wonderful there. It's a getaway when I go to work at least. The hardest part of the job is being a photo tech because they have to juggle the most out of everyone else besides the managers. You have to make sure pictures and other things are being printed, inventory is being stocked, helping the cashier, covering lunches and breaks, going and helping the pharmacy, etc..It becomes difficult to juggle everything at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in the pharmacy and learning about medicine because that's what interests me."

good,"the enviorment is very pleasant, management makes things easy. alway learning new aspects of the department and other departments as well so you are able to work any position in the store if needed which in its case will secure your job due to knowledge. some patients will be feelilng sick and tired after spending a long day at the doctors office which will make them jumpy but as soon as you show them you care of how bad they feel they make you feel even better."

The management was easy going, and helped with whatever we needed. My co-workers became my best friends, and I looked forward to going to work for them. The hardest part of the job was trying not to let down a customer, if we did not have something in stock, we tried our best to substitute whatever it was.

I admit I worked a little bit more slowly, but it was only because I didn't want to make mistakes.  Or at least the chances that I would make a mistake.  When the pharmacy slowed down I asked questions of those that worked there, who were all too happy to answer my questions.  I helped count medications, change manufacturers, and was shown how to do a partial fill and do some data entry.  I enjoyed being able to help other people!"

I surprised myself at times, especially when learning how to drive and operate the forklift equipment.  I also ran a tote machine as well as maintained that machine and kept a record as to the number of totes that were cleaned on a daily basis.  In the end, I became a porter which entailed maintaining a clean environment in the restrooms and cafeteria, as well as a few offices.  The most enjoyable part of my day included meeting up with some team members I didn't always see on my regular routine.  I'd have to say that I think the hardest part of my daily job was maintaining a good productivity level, which I managed to do.  I thank Walgreens for giving me the opportunity to meet and work with so many great individuals as well as learning a lot of things I never knew previously.

It helped the store a lot. I got along with all of my coworkers since day one. Yes i was there to work but i made sure to make it a fun environment as well. The hardest part of the job was balancing school,personal and work life. I worked between 25 to 40 hours a week."

Even with over six years of experience in retail pharmacy, I still learn something new every day. The most rewarding part of my job is helping patients afford their medications.

I gained knowledge of customer service, answers to insurance issues and the way things work, and teamwork.  My coworkers became more of family.  To this day, I visit every time I am in the area just to catch up and retain the relationships I built.  The hardest part of the job was keeping composure with upset customers.  The easiest way to do that is to remember they are not directly mad at me, they just don't know the process and procedure that usually goes back to an insurance company or doctor's office.  Being able to involve my knowledge of those procedures helped to solve the issues and the customer usually left happy, or at least knowing where the problem really was and how they should go about resolving it.

I had heard stories of the opposite of that from numerous different store team members.  That does not change how I feel about the company.  We're all human and act differently in certain situations so that is to be expected in all walks of life.  It is an incredible company to work for and I learned so much about business.  Business, Marketing and Guest Service are passions of mine.  I truly enjoy this type of work.  Honestly, if I hadn't moved so far away, I would had stayed with Walgreens much longer than I did.

Since I've been employed with the company, I've learned to value the efforts of teamwork and it's importance when achieving goals from a business standpoint. At this point, I don't look at my co-workers and management as just their titles. Instead, they've become more of an extended family to me. Job-wise, there most definitely a lot of pros and some cons. The hardest part of working here is keeping up with the various vendors and deliveries that take place on one of our busiest days; Friday. In my opinion, everyday is a good day at my job but if I had to choose just one of the most enjoyable parts of my job, it would be meeting, greeting, and interacting with the customers."

I love my manger because she was very understanding and went out her way to help her customer left her store happy. I liked my co-workers very well, we always helped each other out when the time was needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock and help take care of the customers at the same time, it was stressful but the work was always done before I clocked out.

good,"I love working for Walgreen because it give me a chance to interact with people and i get a chance to help them find what they need. I handle all the codes when cashier calls for example refunds, returns, exchanges and verify the money. I do three cash counts on the register on any shift i worked. i learned how to manage and delegate the work to the employees on my shift and i also teach them how to be a team player. I feel the hardest thing on my job is not having what the customer is looking for but i do go the extra mile by calling other Walgreens or even going to other walgreens and getting the product for them.

My co-workers were very helpful and most importantly respectful with assisting me. Id say the hardest part of the job would be when an elderly person is having troubles with their medical insurance and we are not able to give them their important medications.

good,Since starting working at Walgreens I've enjoyed my work experience. I have learned proper lifting techniques for lifting heavy boxes and carrying them long distances without injury. Mangement was extremely helpful with training and taking time away from their own work to ensure that all employees are properly trained. The co-workers were also extremely helpful with helping to train new employees to make sure that the work can be completed efficiently and in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job is when employees have to deal with rude or disrespectful customers but since beginning at Walgreen's dealing with that has become progressively easier for myself. But at the same time dealing with those customers is also the best part of the job because there is always an opportunity to help the dissatisfied customer find what they need to and help improve the way their day goes through the the efficient customer service that is being provided to each individual customer.
good,"Stress-free environment, lots of learning opportunities"
good,The first thing I do in the mornings is pull reports and check to see to see the schedule of what duties and required for the day. The lesson I learn is about all the new products and their benefits. As long as you do your job the management leaves you alone. My fellow workers are nice and helpful The hardest part of my job is when it is slow because I always like to be busy. I really enjoy selling the right product to the customer and it makes them really happy.

A typical day at work includes dealing with vendors, ordering, stocking, unloading trucks, dealing with customer complaints and of course, running the sales floor.

good,"From the time I clock in, I have a detailed list of the daily tasks to be completed, which was written by the store manager or me if she/he was absent. I also make strategic decisions regarding the ordering from vendors or warehouse, for seasonal or daily merchandise, along with the correct or really precise ordering of groceries from the Grocery Company, Mclane/Grocer's Supply, adn also ciggarettes from the same company. Both of these orders take precise and knowledgeable ordering techinques, to avoid over ordering, because the overstock locations have to be so controlled it is imparitive that we do not have an un-necessary amount of overstock in each of these locations, all while ensuring, the order was sufficient enough to ensure on-hands through that week.I've learned alot from Walgreens, from cash handling techniqes, to being promoted twice from Sales and Inventory Management, to Assistant Manager- which is a challenging Job at all times, but it also helps my work-shift go by faster.
