good,Fully enjoyed my job as a Demonstrater at Costco. I would set my own table up and orgazine any equipment I would be using that day and then I had to go around the warehouse with a trolley and find the product I would be using for my demonstration. Then read the products information on a sheet given to us by the boss and list any food allergies or good key points about the product ready for customers to view. The main task was to keep my table clean and prepared as well as selling the product the best I could to customers.

good,"Start of shift, might have to help pack grocery items, if not you check the list to find out what section your working in. Management is excellent and also helps where it's needed.

good,There Is no typical day at work It changes everyday but I would have  to say punch in find out what needs to be done depending on the shift and helping with the members needs.  I have learned to work in a huge warehouse type of environment with different people.  The management makes sure the place runs smoothly and does their best to take care of the employees and members.

good,"I had the opportunity to work in the Tallahassee Costco Wholesale where much of the employees were young with great energy. Due to the many different areas of Costco, it is easy once you have a foot in the door to expand to different branches within the company. All they ask is that you work hard, keep busy, maintain a safe work environment, and keep the customers happy. They pay well and offer many benefits; for this reason, many people stay with the company. However, my situation was different in which I lived in South Florida and had to come home after school ended, unfortunately, stepping away from my position with the company.

You learn so much from so many different departments in the warehouse that its amazing. Every employee that you work with is happy to be there and more than happy to help out a member or a fellow employee if need be. The members are very nice and not rude like normal retail stores. The work place attitude is always positive and a no one gets left behind type of attitude. Hardest part the job may be the heavy lifting of different products. Management is always looking to teach their employees something new and will never hold anyone back from promotions or any other desires they may have. All around fantastic company.

I would begin by skewing up the whole chicken bodies, 4 birds per skew, 8 skews an oven.

Once you had both of your ovens going, then you loaded the mini oven with wings and ribs."

good,"Company really looks out for their people. they provide better compensation for their employees than a lot of other companies. the benefits are top notch and cheap. I would strongly recommend them especially if you are a college kid trying to get a part time job while in school. My warehouse is really flexible with school. not to mention if you stick around the whole entire time there while in school, you might be in a position making more money than a lot of your college graduate friends right after college. if you are maxed out as a regular employee by their compensation plan at the moment, you are making at around 45k/year full time. if you get promoted, it goes up even more. but don't get me wrong, it does take time to get maxed out."
good,It's a great place to work. I enjoy going there it's a very friendly environment.just have to do what you have to do do what you're told and everything will be all right

good,I tend to deal with the public. So everyday at Costco is different but I am always up for a new challenge. Working at Costco can help you to be more of a people person an break out of that shell of being anti-social. We have a great management with a great employee staff that will always have your back like a family. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with a customer that already has a attitude then when you get them to calm down and at the end they apologize that's always a great thing.

good,Costco Wholesale was a wonderful Company to work for and with!  I enjoyed years of being there and growing up in the Company.  The environment was definitely a family unit.  A typical day for me was opening the register and greeting the members.  Assisting them with their returns.  The hardest thing for me to do there was say good-bye when I retired.
good,"we are learning everyday with great members and staff to help us go forward "
good,"Everyday I go to work with a smile on my face, I go to my section and see whatever my supervisor needs me to do, if there is nothing in my section I will go to another section to see if they need any help. I do a lot of wrapping and banding as well as sorting items and labeling items. I do a lot of walking around. If there is not much to do I will either clean or empty out garbage bins. I've learned how to do many things at Costco as well as develop skills and many great relationships with my co workers. The management is great, it is a nice clean warehouse. We are always on top of our game. All of my co workers are very friendly and we all work well with one another and are very driven and motivated. Hardest part of the job I would say is just keeping up with everything and making sure you are doing things the right way. Most enjoyable part of the job would be just working hard and keeping busy and feeling accomplished at the end of the day."
good,Unlike a lot of employers Costco actually cares about their employees. If 8 or more hours are worked you get two 15 minute paid breaks as well as an unpaid half an hour lunch.

good,"Fast paced greeting members working environment, but good high energy with the members and employees. Learned a lot about how other people work with teams as a team member and helping out the person with the most work and sharing the load to complete the task in time. Management was excellent  they really cared and treated employees like family more than just regular employees. Co- workers were more like friends then co-workers sharing their knowledge about there previous work experience and working for the company. One of the most difficult parts of the job was every now and then handling a customer that was upset, but understanding where they come from and doing my best to meet their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be asking how members where doing about their day and just striking up conversations with members and learning and building a friendly friendship clientele."
good,"My time at Costco was enjoyable, the management are friendly.  Its a very fast paced place to work.  Sky is the limit on opportunity here."

In all three areas, I inform members of the various membership cards the company offers, as well as promoting their credit card.

Management is very comprehensive with scheduling and there is room for advancement in the company. It is enjoyable to be able to work and interact with great people.

good,"Costco at the time was a great place to work. The same old good reviews about the place in that the benefits and the hourly pay is great. I say it is the best job/career that one can have without a college degree. I had an unfortunate experience in that I was terminated over something silly, and was encouraged to sue for wrongful termination, but the time and effort was not worth it to follow through. The good thing is that without the termination I would not have gone back to college and finish my education."

good,"Costco Wholesale is a wonderful place to work.  There are many interactions with co-workers on a day to day basis creating a family feel with your fellow employees.  It was rare that I ever left my work day upset or angry.  This job taught me patience.  When dealing with the public you never know what you are going to experience so you must be patient with someone who may be having a bad day or someone in a hurry while balancing your fast paced environment. The management does a good job of engaging with you. Even the warehouse manager goes out of his way to have a few minute conversation with you before continuing on with what he needs to be doing. The co-workers at Costco are fun and a lot of them ended up being lifelong friends.  We are like a little community.  Hardest part of the job wasn't anything physical, even though this is a physical working environment.  It was trying to please every individual that came through your line as to give them the best shopping experience they have had.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with a crew of people that are personable and fun on a day to day basis."

The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to learn and experience the customer service, fast paced work environment."
good,"I can honestly say that I loved working for Costco Wholesale and coming into work. I would show up 15 minutes early to make sure everything was put away and check in with my managers to see what my shift was going to entail and be like. I usually would do go-backs, then would report back to front end and stay on the register for the remainder of the shift, unless otherwise. I learned to be a forgivable and passionate person since working for a worldwide recognizable company you would to remain calm, collective and concentrated. I loved my workers dearly.

The only time we really have to literally work two times harder than we usually do is during inventory, it is already important to get all customer frames done and shipped out as soon as possible, but during inventory we have to be accurate at all times so that we know the exact number of stock is recorded.

Money management I was responsible for a cash drawer that I had to count at end of each shift. Since management had their plate full with their duties I had to be clear on any difficulties I was encountering and was to improve service since I was seeing it first hand. Work well as a co worker and a team player. A good work environment ensures that the shift runs smoothly and help new employees to learn the job and to fell welcome to the team. The hardest part of the job was learning to ask others to help out with duties instead of taking on a lot to ensure that it was completed. The best part was the family environment that made me feel welcome and made it fun to go to work instead of an obligation.

good,"My job at Costco was hard work but very rewarding. I would push carts, help cashiers, and help organize and fold the clothing tables. Pushing carts was hard work but it was not the worst thing in the world. My co-workers and the management were the best. Very friendly and willing to answer any questions."
good,"Costco was an excellent place to develop basic workplace skills, and as a corporation they strive to provide outstanding benefit programs to their employees. I was able to cultivate an understanding of their business practices, as well as the ability to work in retail as an alternative form of employment. The most difficult aspect of this particular work environment though was that it could become quite tedious."

good,"Costco is the best employer anyone could ask for. Due to the popularity of this business, it is always busy with a diverse clientele of all cultures. A typical day is always full of hundreds of people so it is constantly moving. I have learned that there are few employers like Costco that treat their employees so well and compensate them so generously. I also learned that I thrive best where I am challenged in ways that stimulate the use of specific knowledge, creativity, and technical skills. My coworkers were so numerous and diverse it was always exciting. The hardest part of the job is staying mentally motivated through what can be often repetitive and physiclally taxing tasks. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the laid back dress code, the co-workers, working at the same place you can shop at, the benefits, the awesome members, and being paid like a professional."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of.. I would clock in, sign out my rf gun, or electric pallet jack. Grab an Order for picking. & ride/walk around the warehouse scanning my items and stacking them nicely on a full or half pallet.

Once my pallet is wrapped I drop it off at the loading dock where i am directed to load the pallet onto the delivery truck or to leave it at one of the doors on the loading dock. "

My co-workers were the best people I ever worked with and the friendliest. They made my time go by fast.

Everyday, it is something new to learn, I'm a risk-taker and always liked to go for it. I always respect my management if there were something that maybe I did not like or it was confusing, I like to talk to my manager or supervisor for a better explanation but I will never disrespect any co-worker or management. The hard part of the job, I really did not have any complicated. I love my job, I love to help with costumer services, and always meeting new people everyday and learning new things too."

I am very comfortable on a register and handling cash from this experience. The next 3 years I was a part of the Photo Lab. I leaned a lot from this position. I processed photos, ran a cash register,helped members (both everyday personal photographers and professional photographers). I also gained experience working on the digital photo processer by learning from technicians when they would repair the processer. The latter year I worked in Costco's vault. On a daily basis I would count over 30 tills, make deposits, and handle any other money related details. Costco is a great company to work for. A variety of postions are available and the medical benefits are excellent."

good,I always come to work prepared dressed and allowing myself 20 minutes before any shift to rep are for updates or instructions. I dress professional and always smile. I learned that to never take a consumer that is having a bad to personal. I learned to listen and a offer ways to resolve the problem for the consumer keeping in mind I too am them when I am in the retail world.

good,"A day at Costco is very interesting. In the morning very few customers come, but during the day till 7pm its very busy. I learned that you should shop for groceries and other items in the morning to get it out the way and also to get in and get out without a crowd. The hardest part of my job would of been i think packing a crowed cart. After the customer is done purchasing, I have to pack the cart for them. And if the customer has a alot of items in one small cart. I have to pack the items in a neat fashionable way for their liking. The co-workers there are fun loving people. They treat you as if we was family, they are also hard working and determined people. Costco is a hard, fast past and busy enviroment. You have to be able to keep up and pay attention to whats around you. The most enjoyable part of my day would be closing, because its not that crowed at the work place and its quiet. Alothough after closing time there is more job duties to do but its easy and i dont have to work fast."
good,everything is great about costco it was seasonal so i had to leave

good,A typical day at work is always a hard days work but can be enjoyable. I learned out to decorate like a pro. The management team a very down to earth and straight forward with what they require of you. My co-workers are the reason i come to work most days.

Coworkers are on the same page. I've made great friends within the company. Hardest part of the job?

I had some issues that were personal and I got penalized for them. I should have challenged them, but I did not. They were all legit, excusable points. I have learned a lot from that. I enjoyed the job and would not mind going back."
good,"Hi Everyone!!!"
good,"Costco required its employees to work hard, work safe, succeed in their job tasks in a fun environment. What I admired so much about Costco was the opportunity to work hard and advance into management that challenged its employees to grow in their personal abilities and job skills. I was able to use my transferable job skills like excellent customer service skills, organization in my work area, good work ethics, in my previous jobs to enhance my ability to learn and add new job skills and allow me to showcase what I had in me and how I was an asset to my team and coworkers."

good,"Mi trabajo comenzó siendo de limpieza en el área de panadería, y terminé como empacadora del pan, aprendí muchas cosas como decorar un pastel, hornear, en el tablero a hacer el bolillo, hojaldras, cuernos, muffin, etc., un poco de todo, no tuve ninguna falta de respeto por mis compañeros, lo difícil era llevarse bien con el encargado de panadería, hacer lo que el pedía a pesar de que no respetaba las políticas de la empresa, lo que mas me gusto es que tuve un muy buen comentario de unos clientes que ocupaban un pastel urgente y no había decoradoras ya se habían ido y yo estaba en otra área, pues les hice la decoración y se fueron muy contentos."
good,Working for Costco taught me the value of communicating well with co-workers and customers. In a high traffic environment like Costco it is important to ensure that the job being performed is done well to minimize mistakes that will reflect the company or myself in a negative way. While working in the optical department I was able to pick up some clerical skills as well as more interpersonal communication skills.
good,"They are very organized and great place to work, we oriented classes for women's and are team was great lots fun to work with each individual person from different culture learn a lot ."

good,I can't say nothing but good things about this place. I loved working here. The people were great and the work was great.
good,"Costcos has a strong company and it appreciates its employees. My days in the tire shop were fast paced and mostly filled with work. There was a strong team of guys around me, being the youngest, I had to prove myself. There was alot of support in the tire shop and around the job aswell. Management was also very supportive and made sure demands were always met. I would have to say the hardest part of my days were when we were backed up and no signs of a slow down for hours. Customers can sometimes become irate and wont take there time to understand that we can only move but so fast in a limited shop especially on the equipment side of things. I enjoyed my 2 and half months there but due to the fact that my school end was near, relocation back to Miami was my route."
good,"A typical day includes walking my department (electronics) and assisting members with any questions or concerns they may have about the products Costco offers. Cleaning my work area, setting up displays, and making sure all displays are functioning correctly. I've learned the business culture of a worldwide organization like Costco. Management is great. They always worked with me and my school schedule when I was studying at UNM. My co-workers are all great to work with and are all very helpful when I need help. The hardest part of my job is walking on the concrete all day. The most enjoyable part of my job is working helping members find the perfect product for them."
good,"1. A typical day at Costco is busy and hectic"
good,"be on time,responsable, have my job done in good standard"
good,excellent. the most enjoyable part was working with the co-workers I had who were so cool. the part I didn't like was working in the snow and ice outside in the winter.
good,As an employer Costco warehouse is amazing. This company appreciates and takes amazing care of their employees. Benefits and pay are astonishing. And they work around your school schedule!
good,"Stocking is a lot of work being you need to be able to handle constantly lifting very heavy items on a regular basis. Management is noticeably better than working elsewhere mainly because those managers have started from the bottom inside the company like everyone else thus letting them know how things are and can be done, and they are more of a leader than just a boss. My favorite thing about Costco is their belief in treating their employees well and great things will happen. Of course they do expect you to do your job, but having respect from the company makes anyone want to work even harder for them and that's what makes Costco successful."
good,"Working at Costco pharmacy is a pretty wild ride. A typical day consist of taking in an average of 600 prescriptions per day. We are never slow. Costco is usually a busy place and we attend each member with exceptional customer service. That means we have to take in many prescriptions, input them in, fill them, and verify them while maintain low wait times as best we can. Things could get pretty hectic in there but being appreciated by the patients when they notice how hard we work in there makes it worth it."
good,My typical day at work consists of answering upwards of 70 calls a day regarding orders placed on the Costco.com website. Providing customer service to all of the members and non members that visit our site and have questions regarding products and our company in general.

good,"fun place to work with alot of people to gain experience and talent from, while working on your own self"
good,Costco has job opportunities ranging from maintenance to meat cutters to managers.  A typical day starts with members getting the best products at a great cost.  Management ensures that daily tasks are being performed but rarely need to enforce because the employees for this company work very well without supervision.  I learned that the supervisors and managers are there to ensure safety and timeliness when it is necessary but mainly are a backbone to their individual teams.  The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that this company is a team and everyone watches out for everyone and it was a great environment starting at the top all the way down to the members themselves.
good,"Good job over all, people are great to be around. the atmosphere is so calm. you have many task but there not thrown all at you at once to build stress. pay was very good $11.00 :)"

The hardest part of the job for me wasnt anything i learned everything pretty quick. I was able to work in different areas of the warehouse thats what i liked the most. At costco i learned the most about member service and patience because members want to be treated with respect and common courtesy. You want to treat people as you want to be treated."
good,I have always loved a lot of work and when someone depends on me to get something done! At Costco they challenged me and I enjoyed it! Only a seasonal position.
good,"I loved working at Costco. It's a great job to have, but really hard to get a job especially after the season is over. The bakery is the best job to have."

The hardest part of my job would have to be the physical demand that happens when I would have to pull carts. The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with the customers and other co-workers, being able to learn something new everyday."

good,"great environment to work, a lot of opportunities to advance with the company. it was seasonal job. benefits are really good it was just a great place to work for"
good,Working in a fast pace environment allowed me to be able to accomplish any task set before me. I learned that there is will always be people who do not agree with you but that can not be the cause of your down fall. The management team were very productive and about the growth of the company and tried their best to please everyone that they could. My fellow employees were all great people to work with and also to learn from when it came to the job responsiblities. The most enjoyable thing about the company is the way that they yook care of their employees with salary and yearly bonuses.

good,"My experience has been that COSTCO, is ran extremely well, and puts it customers first, While treating the employees as a team and very fair."
good,"Costco is a extremely fast-paced and friendly environment. I gained a great deal of experience on the inner-workings of a pharmacy. I got to see first hand exactly what a pharmacist and the technicians do on a day-to-day basis. I loved the people I work with, they were friendly, patient, and always open to my questions. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the pace but I adapted quickly and the shifts flew by! I would recommend employment at Costco to any students currently perusing their secondary studies. Costco is very flexible with scheduling and encourages academics. Overall a fantastic experience!"
good,"I was always busy. I would go and retrieve carts in the parking lot while also assisting the many customers that would need help. From pushing carts to their cars, loading large items like couches, to helping the cashier, there was always something that needed to be done. With this in mind, I was pushed to get everything done in an efficient manner that evokes quality in the service I was providing the members. All while keeping a friendly attitude greeting and helping those who require assistance. Though you will run into some unsavory customers, the grand majority of them are friendly and know the store pretty well or are welcoming to the additional help you will provide. The other employees are extremely helpful and all-in-all very enjoyable to be around."
good,"Working as overnight merchandiser is a highly physical line of work."
good,"Costco is a family based in philosophy. They pay their employees well above the national rate by way of comparison. Costco believe that employees are the most important assets in the company. The management staff truly believe in leading form the front and does a great job of instilling ownership, and confidence into every employee. Work & life balances are not an issue with this company at all. Health insurance and and holiday benefits are second to none."
good,"Costco Wholesale is an amazing company, there's room to grow regardless of what position is initially given. The staff and managers are approachable and are helpful even in the tightest situations. Any work done within the warehouse is meant to be done as a team and not a solo operation. The warehouse also provides variety in daily tasks and routine, because it's customer based the same ""stock and buy"" routine is there but the amount of people that are dealt with on a daily basis changes so much, that the job feels different every time. Even though Costco is a ""Big Box"" retailer, it has so much more to offer, the employees are happy to be there and it loses any stereotypes given to it once you understand the company a bit more."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I actually enjoyed going into work each morning. I felt the leadership team was great as well. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections..
good,"Working the Costco Meat department has been an interesting  experience for me.  I have closed up the shop and I have opened up the shop, both are easy to understand and exciting to do. The staff and management are everyday people who love to get down to bizness. The hardest part of the job is rush hours, especially when the department is under staff. Nonetheless knowing what is needed, moving at a smooth pace and cooperating with each other as a team a successful day is everyday."

good,Great Charisma through out the Company. Employees are very helpful and understanding to anything that may be going on our that you need help with. Hours can be long but with the right enthusiasm its over in a blink of an eye.
good,"Early start because we had to restock all items in the warehouse before the start of business."
good,"A day working at Costco was an exciting one. Every one always had a smile & a kind word, staff & customers the same. I assisted customers who needed help locating an item, manager, or to one of the many services (mechanic, photo center, eye doctor, etc.) My main purpose was to help out the cashiers. Help them to keep the line moving in an untimely fashion. I was responsible for unloading all the not so heavy items on to the conveyor belt, count the items left in the cart, let my cashier know, and then after the items were tallied up, reload the cart for the customer."
good,I like working with members. You get to know people. It is fast pace for the most part. It is a good place to work.
good,"Very good work place, very good treatment of employees and very good benefits."
good,"I recommend/encourage anyone and everyone to apply to work at Costco. It gives well above average pay. You can actually make a good living off of their pay rate and you get a fifty cent raise every four hundred hours you work. If that's not enough to get you too apply, I don't know what else I can tell you. Starting pay isn't anything less than eleven dollars an hour."
good,At my last job a typical day was to look on a production log and complete the task at hand on a timely basis. I have learned to work closely with others and to communicate with others as well as learned to love all my close realatives. Their was no hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers.
good,fast paced environment  fun to work at the hrs went by quick due to u running around
good,"Costco is an amazing company to work for. I had the pleasure of working as a marketer. Everyday I would come in be as,signed a partner and be sent out to a specific zip code. We would go door to door to different businesses meeting people, telling them about Costco and the benefits of being a member, and hopefully selling memberships. We held onsite events during which we would go to certain businesses set up a display table with Costco products and talk to large groups of people about the company. I learned so much about marketing. I learned how to pitch ideas and sales. I also learned how to set up display tables and speak to large groups of people. My manager was amazing, he made sure he was available to everyone at all times both on and off the clock and even when he was on vacation. He was professional, friendly, and above all he was motivational. My co-workers were great, some were experienced in the world of sales and some were newbies like myself but I learned something from working with each of them. The hardest part of the job was selling memberships. Sometimes people would sit there and listen to your whole pitch and politely turn you down and others would say they weren't interested before you could finish saying hello. The most enjoyable part of my job was the rewarding feeling of meeting and sometimes exceeding my sales goal for the week."
good,Each day is a very energized work experience at a Costco store.  The day can be interesting on many levels that make both work there a true challenge to each employee. The biggest reward is the ability to satisfy the member while they shop for daily products and also share your personal ability to help them determine new possible ideas for their actual shopping needs. I enjoy the diverse levels of business that happen in a Costco warehouse setting...Members will come back each time to your line if you making the direct effort to offer them a quality shopping experience at your store....Also fun getting to know what they like to shop for when they do require something that is directly beneficial to their needs.

The most enjoyable where the experinces.

good,While working at Costco Wholesale I learned so many new habits that's will help me in the long run with future employers.
good,"You were expected to do your job and do it well but the managers were excellent at their jobs which made our job easy to do. Many companies choose to make as much profit as possible, meaning they only pay minimum wage, but Costco focuses on the fact that its workers were more than just a form of cheap labor. Their emphasis on taking care of their employees just as much as their customers is no doubt a big contributor to the global success that Costco is experiencing today."
good,"Costco has worked with my schedule since the beginning of my undergraduate career, allowing me to have time off as needed in order to complete classes and succeed. A typical day at work included positive engagement with members, respect toward coworkers and setting personal records whether it was a goal to get faster at checkout, become cross-trained in multiple departments or work faster outside.
