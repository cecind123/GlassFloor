rating,review
bad,One of the worst places I have ever worked. Managers get fired or quit monthly. Every qtr upper management cuts hours to have less people do more work. Even if you hit all their sales goals the raises are minuscule.
bad,hands down the worst work experience of my life. tight knit locals who shun anyone who is not ‚Äúnative‚Äù to the area. lots of turnover and hiring of lazy drug using students from the university down the road. the manager is a pointless waste of space who radiates self importance.
bad,Worst job ever lowes will drop you for no reason they are a bunch of racist the company is run like chicken night in turkey the managers are idiots all lowes cares about is numbers and profit and they treat the employees like animals and all they do is lie to you my advice stay away and don't work at Lowes it is a junkyard trash dump company cause all managers ate nothing but trashy people
bad,I filed a harrassment complaint and the management didn't do anything about it because they are all friends with  that employee. When I asked to move departments the manager wouldn't give me the same hours.
bad,"if you are hired, you will not necessarily be hired for the same job you applied for.  only management get full time.  way to much drama between staff."
bad,"I had previously worked at a Lowes RDC and it was awesome. Recently worked a short time at a store and it was so degrading, low wages and zero help or training from my manager as though I wasn‚Äôt wanted."
bad,"Schedules are subject to change without notice, cashier's aren't expected to make conversation with customers, and the managers are always on your back about speeding up when the customer is taking their time at getting their money or credit card out to pay for the purchases"
bad,"I never really got the help on getting  thing's done.The Zamboni never got the item's for cleaning the floors and other misc.I didn't mine the place,but it was the feeling that i should not be here to much longer."
bad,"Just like it says doesn't matter, the company gave you a goal, one setting you up for failure and then they will see to it you are removed. Want to have an asinine goal to hit, want people to tell you to do the wrong things and then lie about it after the fact when you don't know any better; work here. Want to be told you count in front of everyone and then just how replaceable you are behind a closed door; work here. Want to be told you will get no training to fulfill your new role because you have been around awhile and should already know it..... you guessed it work here! When you see those new faces on the register with no vest and they are the only one there, guess what; that is their training - Trial by fire."
bad,"Please, do not apply at lowes in marrero. Racist managers, incompetent managers and do not care about your life outside of lowes when it comes to the schedule. Beware if you have kids that need to be picked up from school, you will never make it. Their policy is lowes before everything else. If you work a second job, they will force you to quit one or the other. And most importantly, Reporting anything to HR is an absolute joke. They will take your report, go back and tell the managers who reported it and what was said and you will be targeted from then on until you quit or make a mistake and be fired. This is not rumors, this is experience."
bad,Does not care about the employees.  The hour get cut with no notice if they don't make their sales goals the day before!  There is never enough staff to cover the departments.
bad,"Low pay for most, poor work environment. Management very disorganized. Ok compared to some places but still not quite there. It‚Äôs retail so can‚Äôt expect too much from Lowe‚Äôs"
bad,"Management sucks, they play favorites. People don't complain to others but run to management like they are a 5 year old. very disgusting. Management DOESN'T TRAIN for power equipment, makes it frustrating to tell customers. Sorry you have to come back no one can help you. "
bad,"Most managers give a very small amount of information about your job.  Managers are hard to find.  Policies on returns are not the same on each day or customers.  This causes not very much confidence in management.  When you give company policy on returns, management does not back you or company policy's.  This causes customers to not trust you as an associate.  Work issues with checking each morning with reports on inventory take to long.  Computers should help with this issue. Lots of associates just put any number of products on there report."
bad,Lots of favoritism. Management and others seem to gossip alot.  Not really room for advancement. Lots of backstabbing. Do not work here.  They don't really care.
bad,Mangment isbad. Store manger is the worst i have ever seen not a family store at all noone is happy there things need to change or they will loose more
bad,Lowes is a bad qorking enviorment assistant managers gettin fired escorted out sleeping with DMS . They treat you with no respect disrespectful. Managers are not very  nice. All in all it was a bad experience it was not the right fit for me.
bad,One of the worst work environments ive ever been apart of. Management was very unhelpful. Very high expectations without proper training. I would not ever go back to working for such an awful place.
bad,"Horrible leadership, unrealistic expectations, no accountability, not compensated for work. Harassment is tolerated, preferential treatment is rampant,."
bad,If your are not part of management inner circle then do not expect any type of raise time off and no matter how loyal you are to the company still beware of being let go at a drop of a hat with no explanation
bad,"This company doesn't care for its employees, the only good benefit is the vision insurance, there is no room for growth, and management relies heavily on nepotism to fill job openings."
bad,Terrible place to work they dont support you or appreciate your hard work for them and your loyalty to the company ... God forbid you have a customer that is stealing! Because you job is to detour them!!! If you say anything to the customer you will loose your job! Even if the customer pays for everthing üò£üò†üò° you are the bad guy not the good guy!!!
bad,"Horrible management and underpaid for the type of work you have to do. Lots of physically demanding work, very poor management, and the schedule is very inconsistent Lowes thinks working 30-40 hours weekly is part time. Overall just a poor company to work for."
bad,Political hub. Spineless leadership. No support from US counterparts. Bad culture. Nothing to learn. Food is bad. Facilities are eyewash. Too much favouritism.
bad,"Thankless job who only cares about the bottom line.  The ground is always moving below your feet, constant turnover.  You will have no idea if you have a job from day to day. Everyone is highly disposable and this company has proven that day after day.  Leadership team will do anything to make them look good, even if it is you losing your job.  Pathetic because there is a ton of untapped talent in the store that want nothing to do with moving up because they see how the management team is driven into the ground day after day. 70 hour work weeks are the norm for management."
bad,Imagine trying to climb a mountain with a backpack that weighs a much as you. Each and every step.... management adds another 5 feet to the top while your co-workers ( who you have done everything you can to help them) throw boulders at your feet. Store manager spent more time building himself up instead of building his team yet had no idea of how to use a pallet jack let alone cut 4 strips of tape to set a side stack. Should go back to selling shirts and ties.... not sure was good at that either
bad,it is was a very toxic workspace! hours are horrible and I legit felt as if I didn't belong in the store what so ever! I am very glad that I quit and will never go back
bad,"dont even apply, the management are naricistic pigs, its hard to fathem how they go through help as they do. dont care about there employees they look for reasons to get rid people that threaten there jobs"
bad,"The company is a a horrible place to work, they do not focus on employees or family..they are currently in a state of only hiring and promoting Walmart and home depot people"
bad,From management on down lowes upper staff are caddy -back stabing -unsupportive cliquish -play favorites -make rude comments- turn their back on you -write unprofessional and threatening emails globally-make absurd assumptions -tell lies -spy- eavesdrop - it was a waking nightmare
bad,"Complete waste of a job. Not the company everyone thinks it is. Secrets all over. Pay is lied about upon entrance,  managers show favoritism, far from clean,  can be cut lose by any means necessary"
bad,"The store I worked at was a disaster, bad management and poor morale. Multiple managers have been fired from the store and employee turnaround is insane. I only hope the store is a better environment as there are generally kind people there but with low morale."
bad,company does not back their employees.worked for 9 years and was fired because a customer lied about an incident and what was said.It did not matter that I did not say what they said I said.No loyalty to employees
bad,"I worked for Lowes for 90 days as a part of their new 1 task team. This was by far the worst idea Lowes has ever come up with. They give you 2.5 hours to packout an 800 piece truck, and you have the worst workers possible; because no one wants to work overnights for peanuts on the dollar. "
bad,"This company doesn't give two rats about they're employees or families they worried about stock and sales. They laid off over 100,000 managers in 2016"
bad,There is no sense of communication among the managers and associates. And the store managers . Wish it was better management  throughout the store. But the associate are helpful
bad,They hire you before background test or drug test. Which means you could be hired this week fired next. You work harder for your pay while the fat suits are getting richer. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
bad,"The Gm has no idea how to run the warehouse. Co-workers are amazing hard working people that are forced to work in very unsafe conditions. Mandatory weekly overtime almost all year around. Unsafe, unprofessional, under-paid and filthy conditions. It is a score based system, if in one months time you don't average over 100% you are put on a corrective action plan and in three months if you don't meet their scoring you are termed. The engineers are constantly changing the scoring system so one day you will do really well and the next on the same task you are barely making it. Some of management are very lovely people. I've made real friendships and meet some really wonderful people. This is not a dream job but if you work hard and don't ask too many questions you'll be fine."
bad,They claim when you start that they care about every associate but what they really value is lining their pockets from your under paid labor. I was very optimistic when starting my work experience with Lowes but was quickly discouraged by the excuses everyone else gave as to why they couldn't finish their own work tasks and why I had to either clean up after them or work around what they had left. Additionally Lowes has an extremely bad overstock problem where instead of sending sa disorder back they keep it in the aisle or store it in top stock over filling the shelves.
bad,Back stabbing managment. Targets employees they don't like. Fratatnation  between management staff. Belittles there employees.Work under a constant fear of being written up or did
bad,Care about money not people when you start to make to much the use any excuses to move you out. When bounses are meet they change the rules to make it harder next time.
bad,Don't work here if you want a happy life. It was so boring and the management team was fake and did not care about anything but their schedule. They need to go out of business.
bad,What a horrible company. First off they do not train their employees what so ever. They expect you to know everything. Leadership team is a joke no concern or regards for others. They play favorites they have the store leader who never works weekends he works in retail but has banking hours typical 9-5. They threaten the employees suggesting they will fire them the company is in law suit for working  hours off the clock.
bad,"Store manager would tell you "
bad,Over all Lowe‚Äôs is somewhat good to the customers but not to the employees. The schedule is off and never any help. Expecting the employees to go above and beyond with no help.
bad,Focus is on stock market and trying to catch up with Home Depot. Went from 6 people in my department to 1 person working 2 or more departments. I guess this is good for their stocks.
bad,Bad. all they care about is themselves and not their associates. They refused time off for a medical reason. And could care less if you have a legitimate complaint about work
bad,"Unless you plain on running Lowe‚Äôs this is only good for a temp job, mostly part time work, they do offer good benefits, always plan on working holidays"
bad,ZEOR work/family balance it‚Äôs all about them or you are gone. They dangle the carrot but never pony up when it comes to the MONEY! If you enjoy working 70 plus hours and every holiday and making less than minimum wage then Lowe‚Äôs is the place for you
bad,"I could be wrong it might not be all locations but this one in Hillsborough, NJ sucks. They over work you for a little bit of pay. Their always unstaffed at nights. The managers stand around doing nothing in their phones. The environment overall was bad. If it wasn‚Äôt for the people I was friends with work wouldn‚Äôt have been bearable."
bad,"Management can care less about the hard working people who work there.  If someone is doing anything wrong they don‚Äôt take care of the problem.  They don‚Äôt even give you a raise, saying you are maxed out in pay."
bad,"This franchise is quickly dying, thanks to their CEO. There is no flexibility, no accountability, and no chance for advancement. Management is too busy playing and amusing themselves to actually do their jobs. Favoritism is rampant. Part time is not guaranteed any hours and the scheduling is idiotic. It used to be a decent place to work but now it's a horrible and mentally unhealthy environment. I hav"
bad,Lowe's is a joke now. Unless you're friends with someone higher up or kiss a** there is no room for advancement. They don't care about family all they care about is $$$$.  There idea of customer service is a joke. They just pass them on to the next person. Everyone at the store thinks they are higher on the totem pole than the next.
bad,The rudes unprofessional managers. Hostile work place. If one manager don't like you all of them turn against you. Tasha is a bullet and definitely not a people person.
bad,"The work environment was the most HOSTILE I've ever encountered. Employees & Mgt behave like spoiled mean high school children! If you go there from elsewhere they resent you and try to sabotage all of your efforts. "
bad,Poor management they don't know how to speak to employees and the don't follow the rules in the handbook they do as they please treat people like their nothing and can lie to benefit themselves like no tomorrow
bad,For  you and me and I will be there for you and your family and friends and family and friends and friends and family members will be able to get you to the police station stick on wall street and you can get a chance to show you that I was going to be a good day today
bad,"Pursuit for the basic employees happiness is never considered. "
bad,"If i could give ZERO STARS i would, I personally wasted 15 years of my life and i have nothing good to say about it. They are a mistake to work for. They hold more value for shareholders and Washington politics then employees with families.."
bad,"The store is filled with disrespect, from coworkers to lack of management. No HR backing with harassment issues. The Owatonna store has become a horrible place to walk into, as a customer now, I avoid this store due to the hostile environment management is causing with employees and customers. Hearing an employee getting yelled at (yes, actually yelling at them in front of other employees and customers) and them the employee apologizing to the customers, after the manager walked away, is not what I want in a shopping experience."
bad,Not good now. They are changing so many things and you never know if you are about to lose your job or not. A lot of behind the back stuff goes on for sure
bad,They have favorites and they treat them way better then anyone else even if those people are not hard workers. The are not always understanding when you had family things going on.
bad,"Management will screw you over just because they dont like you. The hours will be all over to place, very inconsistent. Managers play favorites very heavily, so do not have any hopes for advancement, even if you are more qualified. I would stay away from this dumpster fire of a store that keeps changing policies every other week. Also, the pay is low and benefits they offer are not very good."
bad,"No job security, no management support, worst job I have ever held. Management is lost, they have no clue what they are doing.  They schedule so light that there is no coverage for customers. That leads to you being pulled to other departments to help customers. Which means you dont get to do the tasks that you are told to complete. It also leads to subpar customer experiences because you are working in departments you aren't fully trained In."
bad,"Constantly get thrown messes to clean up from management who hides in their office all day, I got lied to about my scheduling when I got hired on when I asked about it after I got hired I got yelled at and cursed at in front of at least 5 other employees"
bad,Employees could be fun and inspiring. But management was awful. Constantly barking orders with no details. When orders were completed it was never according to what they thought it would be. Very contradicting orders. A little sexist and racist. Never worked with my personal life. Turn over was incredibly high. Believe it was around 30% a month.
bad,"Management cares about covering their back only. They will blame their shortcomings on employees and fire them randomly. This location burned unsold american flags. Discarded the rest in the trash compactor. Took the side of my harasser in my harrassment case. When i told management the first thing they asked me was ""but he didn't actually touch you, right?"" Then continued to employ him weeks after the investigation was over."
bad,"No cross-training, Blue Vests never did anything, Managers ignored ideas, and any positive changes. HR department saw change of 4 people in 3 years. Sales Specialists never were appreciated nor rewarded financially for efforts (removal of commissions) and ignored in terms of their ability to provide customer service vs. doing misc. tasks that were ignored by others in multiple departments and positions making the job impossible daily."
bad,"At the Warrington store in PA:"
bad,"save the headache and don't work for them, don't care but preach family oriented, administration is a joke, HR don't know how to do their job. Hire people that are incompetent"
bad,"Working Retail, customers were rude and mean. Management always sided with customer even when they are wrong. No help or support to cashiers. Do not recommend this business. Corporation makes rules. Management doesn‚Äôt support cashiers following the rules."
bad,Since they change their culture it‚Äôs not the same it‚Äôs not a family environment anymore Not only did they lose me as an employee they‚Äôve lost me as a customer
bad,Didn‚Äôt like it the people was unbearable to work with I dint enjoy it it was awful and I wasn‚Äôt happy to deal with people that I don‚Äôt like at all I was unhappy
bad,"Next to being a Janitor. Cashier position is the hardest to satisfy and please all customers. We get disrespected, we get threatened, we get insulted. It is not a great and easy position."
bad,"management wasn't supported at all, the benefits stinks and they were only out for themselves.  Helped set-up the store along with others also to find ourselves dismissed to cut full-time employees to save money for the company.  Was there 5 years before this started cause they didn't want to pay the wages and benefits"
bad,I thought the company was good at the beginning but toward the end of my stay there! It was very hostile and they didn't alway say what they meant!  They started cutbacks and changes in people's assignment and put people on heavy workloads. So people will eventually fail!  My manager in electrical was reassigned to four other departments! Load that nobody could possibly pass with good judgements and decisions!  Horrible company!!!!
bad,"I used to enjoy working at Lowes, not now.  My new managers are useless and evil.  They do no know what they are doing and always trying to look needed, they are not."
bad,Management is horrible. Extremely segregated within the management team and preference over certain employees. Also does not pay enough for the work required to do.
bad,This is by far the worst company I ever worked for  the job as a driver is not to bad. But the management sucks. They pack the trucks so not time for lunch. Management will also throw you under the bus just to save there a job  go to Home Depot
bad,"To much babysitting to have employees accountable. Not support between supervisor, no clear expectations,  employees attendance is horrible, no commitment to work and have the job done,"
bad,many managers hang out with under age people from LOWES and give them drugs and alcohol bad place to work people don't care about their job being lazy helps
bad,Treats u like trash and wants more out of you then they should. Managers only care about themselves and their own advancement. Not a place for a man with a family to work at all
bad,"First of all, I can‚Äôt give you a weekly pay , let alone monthly or annually! They schedule you hours and literally call you before your shift and tell you not to come in! This being not only right before the holidays, but after they already cut your hours! Don‚Äôt apply here !!! I had opportunities to take other jobs, but I liked working with customers there . Management is very stuck up !! They literally walk by you and stare straight ahead, even if you say hi. I said hi to one aim the restroom and she literally gave me the dirty looks! Is that some sort of requirement for them? Save yourself some aggravation and apply somewhere else!!"
bad,For your own sanity don't work there they will treat you like your a bug under their shoe. Totally a waste of time working there and they will fire you on lies.
bad,"Working with lowes was a difficult experience. The store was always very busy. We never had a set schedule. The entire staff had a floating "
bad,Worked for three years.  Got layoff with no notice. They let the hard working people go. They lost good people. No job security.Most managers are all for theirselves.
bad,People are great at store level. Above that however are only soulless callous monsters who care about nothing more than making a buck. You will mean nothing to this company and they will treat you as such
bad,"very crooked management management raciest and not fair to everyone.. if your past of the in crowd you will do just fine , stay away from this location they will screw you over and smile while doing it."
bad,It Could have been better. Management was horrible because they didn‚Äôt make their employees feel valued. Overall the work there was pretty easy. The work environment was negative.
bad,"The manager at this store only cares about himself. When trying to talk to him about stuff it just gets overlooked. The ""manager"" over the cashier's was just as equally horrible. They don't care if you have to take off for your health or if your child is sick."
bad,"A job that stresses you out beyond belief!!! And if you‚Äôre black, you more than likely will be treated differently, even though you give the job your all!!!!"
bad,"Not an establishment I‚Äôd recommend individuals work for. High stress, uneven workload with no form of thanks from a management  ‚Äúleaders‚Äù. Decent benefits after 3 months, but that‚Äôs the only plus."
bad,Trust me your sanity isnt worth the pain this place will put you through. They tell you that you will get decent hours but you never do past your training period. Management doesnt care about anyone.
bad,"Managers will believe lies from customer's complaints and blame employees for lack of patience. Like they say,""customer's always right"". But is not always the case."
bad,Lowes promotes incompetence due to its good-ole-boy network. There is no help or support from management. There is not one positive work ethic promoted. This is not a place where competence and hard work will get you promoted.
bad,"Stressful environment. Bad store manager/district manager. "
bad,That store is all about self and very disorganize when it comes to different departments. Instead of helping get the job done they just point fingers on who did what. With also showing a lot of favoritism!
bad,Lowes has downsized to the point that it is hurting customer service. There are times when there is one employee for three departments. Employees are now working a 10 hour day once a week. Employees have one weekend off every other month. Less is More seems to be the corporate theme.
bad,Lowe's is not a good place to work if you have a family. Management does not care about families even though they say they do. They make you work long hours and make you stay away from your families. It is a good job if you are a college student but other than that I do not recommend working at Lowe's
bad,There are so many flaws in this company that numerous personnel want to get out but can‚Äôt for the fact of they don‚Äôt have any other job experience. This company only cares about making money not about its employees  I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times I had worked 7 days a week and didn‚Äôt get a single day off and when I tried to take a day off they would accept it and then change it to where I would be penalized for not showing up even this I had be approved for my personal day
bad,"Don't even bother. This place has gone down hill fast. CEO only cares about shareholders. "
bad,"I was hired as the HR Coordinator. After being there for a few months I was informed that not only am I expected to do the job duties I was hired for I was expected to handled additional duties of a customer service rep, cashier and sales associate."
bad,Lowes management has there heads buried in the sand only worried about hitting numbers not its any type of strategy but by cutting payroll and having a skeleton crew for weeks at a time. The only time they have enough people in the store is maybe the first couple weeks of the quarter until numbers start dropping. Management is very self involved and some of the dumbest  people I‚Äôve met let alone worked with.
bad,"I wouldn‚Äôt record my worst enemy to this job? It‚Äôs not worth the work. They won‚Äôt give full time, favoritism, bad management, and horrible horrible co workers, and even the Human Resources is the worst  I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs not worth working in retail. Find a different profession."
bad,No good life work balance. Work 8 days in a row. You can go up to three months without a weekend off. Management thinks you live to make their lives easier. They do not value employees.
bad,"Management was brought in from other stores, all 3 to 5 years experience, doesn't take long to move up if you want to stick around, I was part time and got a whole bunch of 7 to 11pm shifts, about 20 hours a week they promise you, and don't really care how you live of that, cut hours frequently, short staffed, bad reviews and they think cutting peoples hours will boost moral and performance :) But the real reason I write this today is because they filed one t4 on time in february, and another one 3 months later after tax season closed,This is illegal as an employer,, They must be in by the end of february, so I got reasessed and charged $600 for not providing the correct number on my taxes, pretty hard to count for that accountant i guess, or maybe with the paying minimum wages that's what you get for an accountant, If you do work here, keep your pay stubs, count them all up and make sure your employer can count too,, might cost you alot of money 2 years down the road, Thanks lowes, Worst company I ever worked for."
bad,Im a cashier and i also stock put up groceries clean and check customers out help in customer service and have a great attitude with serving them . a. Team member is key to good performance
bad,Worst company doesn't pay enough and over works there employees and doesn‚Äôt hire enough staff to equip work load horrible hr and managers THEY SWITCH YOUR SCHEDULE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING
bad,"prejudice management (won‚Äôt get into that one) , they also get mad when it is time to do their job. poor training. understaffed. poor hours, lots of favoritism."
bad,"This Lowe's is by far the worse job I've ever worked at.  The district manager claimed that he was looking at me when he said good morning which none of the managers say in the first place, so he went to tell on me to another disgusting person who worked in HR.  I'm DEAF!  If I didn't hear you in the first place then walk up to me and say good morning since I was always the only one who said it to everyone in the first place anyway.  There was no compassion, remorse, or sympathy if anyone got hurt on the job.  Managers there are always spying around the corner looking for ways to report you so you can get in trouble.  There was ONE good manager there that was helpful whenever I needed a friend.  Thank goodness for him.  The managers suck and never do their jobs as they just walk around and talk about what needs to be done and maybe put one thing away or two but that's it and make someone else like me do it.  I was evaluated by someone who was never there but rather take observations by other employees and a boss who said that she never wanted me there in the first place?  What a joke!!  I used to love to shop at Lowe's but not anymore.  I wanted this to be a career but they didn't want me there as they certainly got their wish.  Thanks a lot Lowe's!!!"
bad,"This company is managed like a 1970s mobster organization. The pay is uncompetitive, management is always unqualified, and the focus is entirely on customer satisfaction. No care is taken for the happiness of the employee. On a corporate level, the focus is entirely on shareholder value, and everyone else is expendable. What a worthless company."
bad,I  liked a few co workers but the hours were not enough to live on. The store manager has no idea how to run the store. I was promised 40 hours and barely received 30. Corporate was called in almost weekly for store manager mistakes.
bad,"Words wouldn't begin to describe the poor experience I've had since working at Lowe's. Whether its the completely broken systems that you're relegated into using on a daily basis to do your job, or the pathetic culture, it's just a hot mess of a company to have to work for."
bad,Those managers like the LIE to say whatever they want just for them to win I learned you're very dishonest company. They fired a lot don't train people very well hiring a lot of Managers from Home Depot they should paint their store Orange
bad,"This job is for you. This job is literally a bunch of children who don‚Äôt know what they are doing, dragging a ‚Äúgrade school‚Äù mentality into thier decisions and forcing good knowledgeable workers to quit. It‚Äôs like a flipping high school popularity contest. Lowes is crashing."
bad,"Was a punctual, team player at all times. No write ups, at any time."
bad,"There is nothing to recommend lowes as a full time employee. Schedules result in most full time employees covering multiple departments and ""impact hours"" make it impossible for internet fulfillment coordinator to be successful."
bad,No communication. Arrogant Management. Disrespectful. Talked down to females especially. Schedule not posted on a weekly basis. The only great thing about this job was the customers. No or lack of training was a problem. No one ever wanted to answer a question because they would feel threatened if you knew the answers.
bad,"Horrible management, incompetent supervisors and stealing employees steer clear from Lowe‚Äôs . I would never recommend any one to work here with the low pay that‚Äôs you get for helping hundreds of customers per week ."
bad,"Poor upper management with virtually no ability to motivate and communicate effectively or to lead by example.  Management operates from a fear mentality.  Employees are not encouraged or trained and are frequently yelled at, belittled or chastised, even in front of customers.  People are routinely fired after several years of service when management perceives they are making too much money. Those people are replaced with others who have no experience and are paid minimum wage.  Lowes corporate is completely obsessed with their share price and the store sales and volume which is fine, except that Lowe's sales associates are generally the reason for it's success or failure.  There is no real acknowledgement or understanding of this fact by management or corporate regardless of what they say.  They recently changed their way of scheduling hours, calling it more ""customer-centric"".  However, the net result is an unpredictable work schedule with rarely 2 days off in a row.  I completely enjoyed my customers and the job itself but will not miss working there. The preceding is my opinion based on my observations over almost two years at this particular store.  I could not say if this work culture is endemic to all Lowes stores."
bad,You can trust no one! The tell you that support you then write you up for the very thing they approved you to do! Management act like they care about their employees when all they actually care about is their bonises!
bad,I don't want to leave a comment for fear of retaliation or termination. I can't really say how I really feel about the job. I don't recommend working in retail if you are afraid of losing your job.
bad,"Racism & Favoritism "
bad,"Initially they insisted they were all about advancing potential talent and that it would be easy to obtain a better position, but there were always too many barriers in the way and little guidance as to how to get to a different position.  Lowes was thrown into upheaval while I was working there.  Job responsibilities changed without adequate compensation.  Management showed inability to lead during this time, and what was a company that theoretically promised growth turned into a company where managers were fighting to keep their own jobs as other jobs disappeared around us. "
bad,"When they like you, they -really- like you. You‚Äôll get positions/promotions without others being fairly interviewed. Then they‚Äôll eliminate your position. When they decide for whatever reason that they no longer like you, you won‚Äôt get interviews for positions, even if you‚Äôre overqualified for them. The level of pay is not at all worth the mistreatment from management and customers alike. Be prepared to have items literally thrown at you by customers. Be prepared for gender discrimination."
bad,"Management has gotten very bad at Lowe's over the years. They ask you to work five or six jobs all while paying you pennies and denying you any chance of moving up. If you aren't one of the managers favorites then they are constantly harassing you and trying to get you to quit. If you are looking for a fair work place and somewhere with halfway decent people to work for, I wouldn't look here."
bad,You can never work hard enoughüò° pay is a joke for what they expect you to do as a floor sales associate in lumber. Store managers are a joke. The real people who have been working there for years who know everything are taken for granted by corporate culture.
bad,Lowe‚Äôs as a company is unorganized and lack good management with expectations that are not real. I learned a lot but also got discouraged due to threatening management.
bad,The place is substandard you apply for a different job at lowes but they turn you down cause they hire outside the store they do not want you to succeed they lie to you managers are worthless lowes don't care about there employees they don't care about customers they treat employees terrible
bad,I wish i had never worked there. Mobile so by far worst stores I've ever been apart of.  It honestly made my hair fall out amd cause weight gain and. I just dont wish this job on anyone.
bad,I wouldn't recommend going back to Lowe's ever. To me if was the worst place to work for. It's poorly ran and poorly managed. That all employees are treated badly.
bad,"don't expect much, store management is lacking and is barely in tune with the stores operation, either that or they just don't care once they leave for the day.  very little ownership seems to happen or is not encouraged.  One glaring example, the bathrooms are horribly kept (used by both customers and employees) never have soap, and more often than not when there is soap, its product taken off the selling floor."
bad,"The supervisor I was working for was absolutely disrespectful and ignorant. Being the rookie I was expecting a little more training and practice but first day I was forced to do almost everything. While one worker walked around with the supervisor all day, I was stuck doing his aisles.. that to me sounds like the supervisor either wanting to get rid of me or clearly showed no respect and likes of me at all."
bad,"HORRIBLE !"
bad,"There are a lot of really great people who work there."
bad,"Unstructured and unorganized"
bad,They only let people they like advance in the store. You don't have to know nothing about anything. If the head cashier like you you're in. If you go over and beyond get medals and certificate it doesn't matter you won't advance
bad,seasonal FT job as advertised.  24 hrs one week and only 16 for next three weeks. Wages hours and inventory to sale not good.  must live your life around a corporation and not be able to work a second job . Must be available 7 days. I knew more info on plants then company. I will not work for a corporation again in my life.
bad,They have their favorite people if you dont fit in your not going to make it. At lowes in Ozark. There is some people that are great what they do and want to teach other. But you get on one person bad side your done. They well treat you like dirt
bad,"Very unorganized and unprofessional work place customer service was always behind on helping customers and providing great customer service, overall management doesn't know how to prioritize tasks and don't have required people skills to properly run a store."
bad,Worthless company to work for they dont care about anything or anyone benefits sick hours suck management sucks the whole company just plain succks and ur not
bad,If you have a life this is no place to work. You will not have the time nor the money to live..Promises are not kept and recognition is nonexistent Cant wait to be gone
bad,"Lowes is going downhill they do not care about you and how hard you work feel unappreciated. As a head cashier, you are a cart pusher, ASM, Janitor they make you clean bathrooms. I have worked over and beyond and no one will tell you thank you."
bad,"I enjoy working with my immediate team, I wish the morale of the company was really how corporate makes it seem. A lot changes with the company but lack of transitional training."
bad,"slaves in the 1800's got treated better "
bad,Has to be the worst communication between staff and management. Training is very slim most of which is done on a computer all hands on training is what ever you can learn on your own basically.
bad,"Employees are treated as units of work, not as people.  Management is inconsistent, ""rules"" are enforced at supervisors' whims.  Management does not utilize employees' skills appropriately."
bad,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend too"
bad,"I was sold a bunch of dreams.  As soon as I was hired, I realized how much I was not told about.  It was a high stress job and once I became acclimated, I was laid off."
bad,"makes it hard for people who actually want to work there...the catty back stabbing, drama filled environment of too many women in one room is only akin to a hen house. Do yourself a favor and do not bother here...like being in a high school classroom without the teacher. toxic work environment"
bad,This store is cancer. The employees are cancer. The customers are cancer. The managers are cancer. The hours are cancer. The pay is cancer. The music they play is cancer. The military discount is cancer. The garden section is cancer. The flowers are cancer. Lumber is cancer. The lack of breaks is cancer. The giant swarming flies are cancer. The head cashiers are cancer. The registers are cancer. Lowe‚Äôs needs chemo.
bad,"the worst place if you are not white, they treat you like a idiot ,not help only criticism and competition ,if the couch don't like you  get the worst truck .I never feel so undepreciated in a job before"
bad,"This is a bridge job. Don't work here. You have no life in retail. Find something else! Not very rewarding. You will only get 6 weekends off per year ! Managers get one weekend off per month ! Just say NO to this job !"
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is literally the worst company I‚Äôve ever worked for, would not recommend. They do not work around people that have other jobs or are going to school."
bad,Could not believe how stupid and incompetent my manager was no communication was injured and screwed over by their insurance company and still stayed working there for 3 years what a waste of my life and a bad choice
bad,"Upper management is poor at best, you have no control over the schedule or days off, there is little to no life/work balance because the company is about the customer and doesn‚Äôt care about staff. If you have plans to further your education, you have to fight for the time off. The company discriminates against veterans and anyone with PTSDveteransanand"
bad,They basically want people to suck up to get to a decent position  very disorganized the management was a joke    The amount of managers fired was crazy  It felt like if I was in high school all over again
bad,You never knew when you number would be up for layoff. They were the major employer in Wilkes County but have betrayed every person who has worked for them for almost the last 30 years.
bad,I would not recommend working here.  Managers are not very efficient and tend to ignore things that are needed or problems.  Lowes will suddenly cut off jobs letting several people go without warning.  Insurance is bad.
bad,I don't know how any other Lowes is ran but this one was ran terribly. None of the managers knew what they were doing and the store was horribly under staffed. You should expect to be doing six extra jobs besides the one you signed up for. It's most definitely not worth the pay. I worked there a month and never even had a real schedule.  I recommend staying away from this particular Lowes.
bad,Lowes has the worse Occurrence policy.  You accure sick leave and they use it as an occurrence against you.  The will fire you with that sorry policy.  They are not supportive of their staff and their management supervisor leads etc are not at all helpful to the process or business.  They lie to their customer and they do not care.  Their online services are horrible their programs are horrible.  Their training classes are horrible.  Not a good company to work for with policies such as theirs.
bad,"The company only cares about having ""yes men"" in management. Experienced managers like myself are being pushed out and replaced by younger,  cheaper personnel."
bad,I will never go back! The management was rude and doesn‚Äôt listen to their employees. I got hit in the head and they accused me of lying even tho i had a note saying I went to the hospital. And the hours were too much
bad,I made a mistake by stopping a customer who was trying to steal I grabbed the cart. They then waited almost a  month to terminate me. They changed how they treated me they played favorites all the time at this store. Once our old store manager left that's when this store went down hill. Even the customers thought so. If I didnt get credit applications they threatened to change my hrs and make me start working weekends again.
bad,Just nope out of here immediately. They do not care about their employees one bit. You will get sucked in and have Stockholm syndrome which will result in horrible mental health.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. Poor management, 3 ASMS and neither one knows anything about anything, the only thing they do is delegate."
bad,Very hostil environment. Had a manager from the lumber department yell and degrade me in front of the assistant store manager who laughed. Will never advise anyone to work there.
bad,they cut payroll things were very stessfulalso on occasion poened and closed store with one other cashier and allmostalways with no loadealso if finished had go outside and do carts
bad,Poor management. Too much favoritism within company. It's not what you know but who you know. Being qualified for a job means little nothing in this company.  in
bad,Worked for Lowe‚Äôs for 3 years all the management I have had in the store I worked in were terrible didn‚Äôt seem like they knew how to be managers on top of just awful communication skills between corporate and the stores no one knows anything of what‚Äôs going on you don‚Äôt feel connected to the company what so ever
bad,"Terrible experience working for this company. Terrible communication from the top down. This store especially was trending downhill, due to the lack of communication."
bad,"Hurt on the job. They refused to help, so I had to get a way.  After 6 months, they finally did get me rehab.  I was asked to leave for a VERY small settlement and am not allowed to go back."
bad,Been there 10 years. They are now embarrassing to work for. They continue to strip employees one by one without care of there current work environment for there employees
bad,"I was hired as Exterior Projects Sales Rep, selling HVAC units, Home Generators, Roofing, Gutters, Siding, Fencing and other products. Lowe‚Äôs training was none. Zero.  They had an outdated computer system that you are expected to learn by trial and error, no support. Somehow I managed to stay 2 years, but overall, it was a complete waist of time.  Stay away from Lowe‚Äôs is my advice."
bad,"with all the new upcoming changes, one is unsure whether their position is next to go. there is no heads up and people are told there job is gone the day it is effective. plus the new scheduling is bogus. they want to be more customer-friendly but with NO consideration of the workers' families."
bad,Poor management. Poor company. New president is just driving company in to the  ground. Screwing all employees with disabilities and accommodations with hours they can work.
bad,Thought it was a nice place to work and as management changed so did how employees were treated. Wouldn't recommend anyone for employment to a place that doesn't care about people just what you can make people buy
bad,"Management are about as stupid as it comes that will do something stupid that affects your ability to do your job then call you in to their office to complain about you when it‚Äôs completely out of your control... Nobody else does code 50s because it‚Äôs mostly old people and lazy people/women that can sure as heck collect the same paycheck as me but not do the same amount of work!! üòä Expectations are very very high if your not old, a woman, a kiss azz , or a manager...  Managers are nowhere to be found most of the time, they barely get anything done, and they constantly are complaining about their ‚Äúhard‚Äù jobs. My Lowe‚Äôs is an absolutely disgusting pigpen of toxic people ‚Äúmostly managers‚Äù that are taking their frustrations out of never becoming anything important in life on Lowe‚Äôs employees. As SOON as I find anything decent I‚Äôm GONE without saying a word, I‚Äôll leave them high and dry like they deserve. And when I come back I‚Äôll make sure to let them know exactly how I feel even if that means I get banned, I could care less."
bad,"Let me go after promising me a good steady job,pay is minimum wage ,didn‚Äôt get my final pay till two weeks after I was let go when I was promised it in 72 hours .treated me nice as an employee but when calls were made for information on my final check was treated unfair and was told you just wait until you get something no real answers"
bad,Lowes is cutting a lot of people I predict it goes under at some point in the next decade. schedules 9 days in a row 4 hour shifts.  and cuts positions for people working there for the longest time
bad,Job not all what you expect it to be. Management sucked. It‚Äôs constant changes to policies every single day. Management give customers what they want. Customers are rude.
bad,Restructuring is going on now. When I started in 2002 till maybe 2010 it was the best place to work. Not so anymore. They hire a lot of part time and there is no room for advancement because if you do they might not make budget and get rid of higher up jobs
bad,no good for carrer advancement. Worked at lowes for a while and its typical retail. Managers get fluctuated back and forth with little to know skills. Company is not looking good for future or future career. Good if looking for part time or extra cash.
bad,"Lowe's has become a very bad place to work. They have and continue to take our pay, our benefits, schedules for days off and weekends off are gone. They started this new program that they said will help us balance work life and home life ‚Ä¶ hahaha right! you will always be at work no home life, you will not know your days off until sched. comes out so much for planning any trips , doctor visits or anything else in life. They want to replace full time with part time and decrease pay to anyone. There is no advancement with in this company! All Interviews are rigged. I have been with Lowe's  for 19 + years and I am looking for a new job due to the fact Lowe's wants to run you in the ground and take all your stocks and benefits until you want to leave! Do not trust anything they tell you! Good Luck!"
bad,"I was supposed to water and do markdowns and the water was never on, I couldn't get to the hoses, and/or we were out of markdown tags so I had to do it all manually, which took hours of my time."
bad,Worked for Lowe‚Äôs 10 years and have seen many policies and ideas implemented without proper research and testing. Every single thing Lowe‚Äôs implements fizzles out within weeks to months. This company cares very little about anything but giving shareholders the biggest bang for their buck.
bad,Managers are very lazy and don't want to help customer's will walk right by you and then call for some one to help after they walked pass you. Not enough staff on duty always a dept.or three with no one working in them
bad,"No direction, love to copy Home Depot and refuse to take any risks. The current CEO has zero creativity and backbone other than thinking cutting jobs will make more money. The previous CEO, while failing at his risks, at least tried to be different."
bad,I‚Äôve worked At lowes for a year then got sick of it and quit I‚Äôve worked the overnight position it sucked they want u to unload and stock the store for only 10 or 11 bucks 11 bucks if your lucky there‚Äôs been plenty of nights I‚Äôve done most of the work because my coworkers were either new or lazy it‚Äôs not worth working for this place  stay away
bad,Not the place to work for. The staff is great but the overall vision is terrible as a company. To many log jams with how to expand as an employee. Short breaks
bad,"The people there especially the head cashiers are very rude, and they plsy favoritisms . They don‚Äôt like to do refunds because they like to argue and have a chance to be rude to customers and the managers are no better"
bad,Lowes was good when started for couple years then just went down hill. Managment was awful and showed a lot of favoritism. Has a lot of racial people.
bad,"If it wasn't for the nonsense that I received from my coworkers every day, I'd still be there enjoying my job at the garden center. I thought I was doing a great job by being knowledgeable about plants, and garden stuff... I guess my friendly, and approachable nature doesn't work well with people I worked with, They feel threatened by my work ethics, and customers started to like me. It's sad."
bad,"They lied to me when they told me, ‚Äú that they don‚Äôt even have an HR department. The management were a bunch of lazy over paid dipshits, who bullied their employees"
bad,The managers shouldn‚Äôt discuss their team members personal life events at each other desk . Additional training should be provided for those who struggle. The main focus shouldn‚Äôt be surveys
bad,"Not willing to work with you, managers will not do their jobs and they will yell, they will not train you and expect you to know what you are doing. Can never transfer to a different department. Manager have favorites that can walking over you and yell but do not get into trouble when they harass you. A horrible store"
bad,"Granted I was a seasonal employee, but because I was offered a full-time job with better pay elsewhere I was going to give my two weeks. The day I went to do so the store manager offered me a permanent position with full-time hours and a pay bump. Maybe a week or two later I'm called in to talk to the assistant store manager I worked under and he starts to tell me that I'm taking too many breaks, I supposedly talked back to another ASM, and a whole lot of other lies. They informed me that they weren't going to follow through on their promises till they saw improvement. Totally ignoring the fact that I said nothing they claimed was true. A short time later I hurt myself while working and had to take time off and when it was clear I couldn't do the job anymore I went to give my two weeks notice. Much to my surprise they said they were already planning on letting me go, calling it seasonal reduction."
bad,"Lowe's is a company that looks out only for the managers, if you're not in the click, I suggest not applying for a job at Lowe's. Lowe's is not fair with their pay, and position comes and go, meaning, if you was hired for a phone operator, at anytime, that position can be taken away with out warring."
bad,"racist prejudice a nightmare if not accepted in to there little group "
bad,"Management is inept and childlike with their communication skills, they're bumbling fools who smoke and drink on the job then run around like chickens with their jeads cut off after they let the work pile up. They refuse to pay over 12.22 and are content with second place even though they've been in the business longer."
bad,"They now have a new person over the sherman lowes who is cleaning out the whole store keeping very few. People who have worked there for many years have been let go so they can have new employees there is no job security there "
bad,"Very unsafe place to work...dangerous.  anyone who complains about unsafe conditions is let go.  "
bad,There is no good management there.Would be great if they ask the opinion of the employee to better the business.Being they are out in the field with the customer.Plus the bringing in 3rd party to replace drivers that they rely on to fix the 3rd party mess doesn't make sense
bad,"it was just ok, job had false pretenses and the hours we're always so unpredictable. Some management thought of employees as beneath them. Was a great place to work 5 years ago."
bad,They lied to my face they told me to come back next week to check up on the application after the interview and they kept on making excuses saying we are sorry we‚Äôre kind of busy right now so I came back today I fell so many coworkers been trained
bad,"Not much can be said there was lots of favoriteism,brown noseing everybody wanted to be the golden child which led to a bunch of accidents and a whole bunch of cut corners it was an entire cacausian crew we never had anbody different hire in"
bad,I enjoyed my customers at Lowe's. As a lumber cashier I often saw the same people multiple times a day. Many would come to my line specifically because I was fast and friendly. The management at Lowe's was poor and unpredictable.  I think I had 5 different managers in the short time I was there.
bad,"The place was terrible when you worked there you where treated as a liability and less as staff over all I hated my job sometimes have to take care of 9 peoples job,because the turn over rate was so high we went through casheirs for the reason they didn't make the credit card goal."
bad,Working with this company for about 4 years I was able to realize how biased the management team was. I had a very bad experience with this company and I will not be returning to work for lowes.
bad,Power hours are joke. These were 4 hours out of the day you weren't allowed to do anything but wait on customers.  If you can't do projects or fill the shelves and wait on customers at the same time you have the wrong people hired.  Set days off for entire month on rotation were somewhat nice but if you needed a different day off they made you take it without pay or use your PTO instead of just switching days off.
bad,You often have to close then open 5.5 hours later. Raises are few and far between if you even get one. They abuse hard working people and no accountability for others who under perform
bad,"Management does not have people skills, they disrespect employees on a daily basis, also unable to perform their duties as a manager. There is never enough staff to properly run the store."
bad,"Very easy job the pay was just not good ,management sucks , very racist,no cashier ever working ,hard to become full time and move up ,family store it‚Äôs all about who u know"
bad,It‚Äôs a fast working environment and you learn a lot working there inside and outside but I think they should care more from the people who work there and you get to learn different skill there and meet lots of people
bad,"Management does not care about employees.  You are belittled on the floor in front of customers and coworkers by ""THE"" store Manager as he is putting is finger in your face. You ask a question and everyone in management says its not my job, I don't know.  "
bad,"I was very excited to work here at first.  The first 8 years of work here were enjoyable and fulfilling.. We always exceeded corporate goals and  had remarkable chemistry. There were many times when we were short-staffed, but always managed to fullfill our responsibilities. The last 3.5 years were a nightmare. Many positions in the store were ""elimated"" overnight, with no warning to those employees.Bonus programs were either ended or made impossible to achieve. Promotions were based on an interview, and ignored all past experiences and successes. And yet we continued to meet our goals in this chaos."
bad,In general a very dissapointing company to work for and just about every employee is extremely unhappy with their job at Lowe's. I wouldn't recommend working at Lowe's to anyone.
bad,"Absolutely no accountability whatsoever, the only thing they accounting is the cash register. They've allowed this group of family members to take over the place, and the last thing they're gonna do is admit thier family and friends hiring policy is why they can barely turn a profit. RUN !"
bad,"Never enough staff, people got away with doing nothing, management is a joke several people should be fired. The  executives are formal Home Depot employees and all they are doing is following Home Depot. They  preach one thing and practice another thing it is no wonder they closed stores and are planning more closings in 2020, and massive lay offs."
bad,Lowes is a company that will turn into a Home Depot. I got laid off for something really stupid. It‚Äôs not only that but the whole environment sucks.  From managers to workers.
bad,Too many cooks in the kitchen! Management seemed to stay locked away in the office 90% of the time. Not much interaction to assist problematic situations with customers because of their inactivity
bad,Very messy place and started going down hill fast. Didn‚Äôt get the hours I was told I would get and it wasn‚Äôt worth the 30 minute drive everyday. Very bad management.
bad,"Massive Layoffs. Not a place to grow, because it's a strong possibility you will get laid off . Mgmt team only looks out for themselves. Corporate has no idea what goes on in the stores, and are constantly making unnecessary changes."
bad,"I have 9 yrs retail experience and appliance sales with a bachelor's degree in computer information systems can't land a career with corporate in the IT department, also was not selected for 3 different appliance positions only to be kept as seasonal associate no word from management on any advancement just told to keep going can't get full time work with this company"
bad,Lowes isn‚Äôt going to let you move up with in the company which is a darn shame. Is horrible that then they don‚Äôt want you to move up. Don‚Äôt recommend it
bad,Management sucks. No one cares about the cashier's safety or health. They fire you whenever they want to. Everyone causes drama and a negative work environment. The managers don't do anything except boss people around. The head cashiers belittle and humiliate the regular cashiers daily infront of everyone. You never get full time. The worst part is mostly all the managers and supervisors were extremely racist.
bad,"No training, no advancement unless you are a suck up to the right managers, managers just delegate because they dont actually know how to do their own jobs, treated poorly by management, underpaid, jobs can be eliminated at anytime, just walk you out at the end of the day with no notice, but want 2+ weeks notice if you would like to quit, do more with less is how they operate."
bad,I was refused insurance. My bonus was stolen from me and given to management. Lied to me about my wages. Was injured and never compensated . I was assaulted by another employee and they said l was lying. That place sucked .
bad,Being a Delivery driver at Lowe‚Äôs is a terrible idea. I had managers arguing with us daily and expecting us to do more than we can do in a day. Over all there was a lot of bad attitude with managers and certain people of the receiving team.
bad,I feel that Lowe's was never prepared enough for jobs and caused more work for me on the job site. I had to work under Lowe's installing flooring and it was not fun at all!
bad,"Lots of cronyism here, managers are dating employees and it‚Äôs all overlooked. You‚Äôre passed over if you‚Äôre not part of the little click. It‚Äôs a shame, store has potential to grow if it was customer oriented and managed well ."
bad,"First of all this location was the worst..HR and management was horrible. People got harrassed you go to Hr they fire you. They played favorites..they treated employees like garbage ..I hated it thier. I got fired due to being harrassed,  I brought the police in the matter and they didnt like that and said some made up story to fire me...i hope you dont have to work at this location..some of the staff were amazing the other half wouldnt left a finger to help you..guest were amazing ..."
bad,"boring, management poor, pay poor, stressful, not enough employees, favoritism to certain demographics, discrimination towards disabilities of certain nature"
bad,Management wasn‚Äôt at all concerned about the conditions we had to work in when we would have to Work outside in the heat for 8 hours and it was frustrating
bad,The turn over at is company is crazy and I use to work at Walmart I was there for 2 moths and got a new store manager training is not a thing there and they don't care about the staff
bad,Lowe's has bred a culture of stress in their work place through changes at both the corporate and store levels. Management walks around as though they are better than the other associates and refuse to take the blame for any of their mistakes. The workplace culture has become that of everyone for themselves.
bad,"This is genuinely the worst place to work. Zero management competency, poor ethics, no balance with life, they don‚Äôt care about their associates-only the bottom line, and the moral is dreadful."
bad,"Advancement is based on favoritism, I am not at all kidding, ethical thinking in upper Management is no competition to the bonuses offered by corporate. They would sell their Mothers for a nickle. This is my current experience at Store #1554."
bad,In my 30 some years working the  past 4 years were the most stressful in my life!!! Stay away from Lowe‚Äôs!!! New ceo is tearing it down brick by brick!!!! Hey still owe me money which they are giving me the run around about!!
bad,"Worked in a new store for 20 months. Enjoyed the work and customers.  However one hand did not know what the other was doing. Communication was very poor.  Too many chiefs, not enough Indians . Even when I resigned, I came in for my last day of work and they had taken me off the system without notifying me. I have never experienced being treated so poorly.  Stay away."
bad,"Pays better than most retail jobs, but the management is a complete joke. Everyone that works there is either retired and don't care about their quality or work, or stuck there waiting for a better opportunity with a real company. The management truly does not care about their employees and will drive away anyone that can actually do the work. Avoid at all costs."
bad,Working at lowes in the beginning was fun but as management started to change so did the morals and the excitement that lowes claims to bring to the people. Ive been to other lowes in other states and the people enjoy what they do. The store Im at has been open for 2 years and the management team has change so much in a short period of time. Between termination or quitting we have lost 13+ from the management time. What does that say about the store and the moral. When you have a management time that constantly reminds you that you can become a customer instead of grow your team what does that tell you about the work place culture. To the workers that is work place hostility.
bad,Very frustrating place to work low pay non consistent schedule when opening the day started with morning meetings that consist of a morale beatdown constant complaining from management and loss prevention these people do not know how to treat their employees
bad,Lowes wants you to bring very heavy items down a 15ft tall ladder ALL DAY LONG plus wait on customers.  Then they keep you there 2 to 3 hours after the store is closed. Your job is threatened at every store meeting in the morning and evening.  You work till midnight and then have to be back at 6am the next day. You will work 6 or 7 days straight with no time off. When you do get time off it is for one day only.
bad,"Doesnt follow corporate policy on receiving product from vendor making specialist  job harder. Do too having damage to pr"
bad,"It was typically very busy and we were always short staffed. "
bad,"I like working my position I enjoy assisting customers and getting the job done, and I am one of the few who are paid decent. The company espouses those same goals of customer satisfaction by corporate videos and an abundance of signage but foster no culture of support, teamwork or leadership in management supervision in the real world of the business at store level. "
bad,"You have to be a girl with a nice rear end in order to get noticed there. 9 times out of 10, you know more than your manager. Good luck getting any of your managers to physically help you."
bad,"The customer are the worst, they all Own the store and complain to much , management is weak NO TYPE OF DIVERSITY WHAT SOO EVER. lack of Spanish speaking employees. I worked at the store and i was there for a whole year for part time i never got a raise my hour got cut everyone complains about working and never got to use any of my benefits since i didnt accumulated them since i was seasonal. The system they have in place is soo old it not user friendly. Lowes makes thing difficult on it self . Not type of organization"
bad,I loved My job except the one person that was over me that Person was out there not to many people got along with this Person but that Person is still there
bad,There job is to make you love but hate where you work I've seen some bad places in my time but this place takes the cake managers lie to you to  benefit there department then lie to the store manager and say you volunteered oh and the new store manager is a joke he don't believe in write ups he will just fire you on the spot
bad,"The job was overwork and underpaid. There were numerous safety issues that were not supervised nor even addressed that were swept under the rug. "
bad,HORRIBLE hours BAD management. These people literally give all their workers 2 days a week 5 hour shifts and when you ask for more they deny you. Their excuse is ‚Äúoh we have to cut hours‚Äù might as well not even have a job if you work 10 hours every two weeks.
bad,"They are a reverse discrimination place for sure! We got treated like poo when they started hiring certain people! seniority means absolutely NOTHING there!!! The bosses favor pretty younger girls and gave them the easier jobs to do! I was there 13 years and got treated like I was a first day worker!!! There is so much wrong with rdc 1421. Maybe corporate should just pop in and check on things, because there are so many safety issues with this place and wouldn't recommend this place to my dog!!!! So many people have left, the turnover rate is ridiculous. People get sick of management not doing their job and quit to go to other places. You have been warned!"
bad,"Lowe's as a corporation is going severly downhill! Corporate, store managers, assistant managers, etc. DO NOT care about their employees!!! They have shown this time and time again! ANY position can be eliminated tomorrow, from store managers on down, in the blink of an eye! There is NO HR, NO FSA'S (janitors), and NO career advancement! They do NOT recognize loyalty or hard work! Ynumbthat can be replace"
bad,Was very excited to begin working for the company. I'm very driven to succeed didn't take long for the new to wear off.  Never delivered on their end.
bad,A typical day at Lowes was getting yelled at by customers because Lowes management doesn't follow their own policy. Also if you ask for job transfer they will accidental fire you instead and take month to fix it and work you still even thought you're not an employee.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of varied tasks, some that you were trained on, but many which you received no training. They encourage employees to seek assistance when questions arise, but requests are often met with criticism or 'that's not my job' or 'I don't know, go ask someone else'. It is interesting to note that management professes customer service is paramount, but when one does provide outstanding customer service they are chastised by management that they are spending too much time micromanaging the customer. The hardest part of the job is determining what you are really supposed to be doing. Staffing levels are skeletal. You can be expected to work in a position which you have had no training whatsoever. Definite divide between management and the employees. No actual career paths are known. The best part of the day was completing your shift."
bad,I enjoyed working with most of the people at Lowe's until the new CEO came it was fun now in a split second they called all the FSA in the office and fired them
bad,"The CEO gets a huge paycheck, just like at the other companies he‚Äôs put in the toilet. He leaves the computer system in the 1980‚Äôs but throws more programs in that CANNOT handle communicating with each other. The 12-15 lazy ‚Äúco-workers‚Äù at my store are taking HOURS of breaks everyday. The people that ACTUALLY work get pushed around by the former military manager and his buddies. If you have a complaint you have to give it to the person who is the problem. Newbies are catching on and leaving really fast!!! The pay is NOT good enough to deal with this horrible job!"
bad,"The new general manager started firing all of the head managers so that they could hire other people for less money. The people whom were fired were some of the greatest, most kind people I have worked with, but the general manager, was not a good guy."
bad,"Sucked, from day one til day I shook the chip machine, and they finally fired me. sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, triple sucked, and on top of that trolls work there."
bad,"Was hired on for season and out of the twenty or so of us, they kept 1. It is definitely not a team -oriented workplace. Everyone only cares about themselves."
bad,Just an all around problematic environment to work in. The only reasonable ‚Äúperk‚Äù of working there is that they sometimes gave us lunch and if we did a good job we MIGHT get a bonus but it was rare
bad,"New CEO came from Depot and wants everything to be like Depot. No regular shifts or days off, a roller coaster ride. In 5 days, you have 5 different start times.you never know if your job is going to be outsource"
bad,"DO NOT even consider working here!!! Be unemployed first and do yourself a favor and don't apply!"
bad,"Easy job, but no help due to an inability to hire a proper number of employees, resulting in being tasked with the work of a few people. Only trains you in retail, not anything construction based, so you may end up giving a customer bad advice which they demand from you. Also no HR staff in the stores anymore, so be sure to contact Lowes legal to get a resolution on issues."
bad,The company is changing not for the better but for the worse. They do not care about the employees anymore the manager look to blame the wrong people and protect their friends and blame the ones doing the work so it looks bad on one but not the other
bad,"I worked for Lowe‚Äôs for almost 25 years"
bad,"Couporate doesnt care about emloyees as it seems, managment just cared about their bonus. Did get a discount on products, great job for college kids. but wouldnt reccomend for someone trying to live off of."
bad,"They are cutting our hours from 40 to 20-23/wk. We had worked 40 hours even as part time employees. They are currently cutting from 40 hours down to 20-23 hrs a week they are cutting us down so that we will be forced to quit & look elsewhere. If they laid off, they'd have to pay unemployment. Even though they did just lay off several hundred janitors, assemblers. Also Just had a hiring Fair! With so many who's hours are getting cut to shreds!"
bad,Managers are hateful and are not fully well trained. Expects employees to work themselves to death but nothing to show for it. High school atomospere allowed by managers. Horrible place to work!!!!!!!!
bad,This company is going downhill fast. Avoid at all costs. It is terrible. Management are bullies. Corporate treats employees like dirt. They will cut your job.
bad,Management was very poor there. You would apply for a job within house to get moved up. And they would hire some one off the street first. Very unfair company!! Worked more then just your position.
bad,"Inconsistent work schedule,favoritism,let people go without any notice,lack of communication,management not very friendly with employees,need surveys done all the time. Scores should not be based on surveys."
bad,"Your always concerned about job security. Corporate can eliminate your postion without notice and no compensation at any time. Very few set schedule, if your family oriented this is not the place."
bad,outsourced to an inexperienced couple ... There will be a problem if they get busy.... Lot of competition around.  Good luck !!! Customers are all ready getting products put together wrong ...
bad,"I will not recommend Lowe‚Äôs @ least not my location. There is no team work, within the leaders. It‚Äôs a lot more too but I dont have the space to tell."
bad,"Management wasnt understanding. Had death in the family and they could care less. Had booked and paid for a trip for my birthday, before working there! Do u think they cared? No...."
bad,Work here at your own risk! They hired me twice and laid me off twice with no notice. The 2nd time the Manager told me my position is been eliminated at all Lowe's stores. Yes this company is big time Shady because they didnt move me to another department. Sorry To Break the news
bad,Low pay..Bad hours..No future  have to close at 10 then open at 6...Only a manager should do this job! Lots of mad  customers not enough help on the floor or cashiers.Paid every two weeks..Should be weekly.Poor mangement..Not flexible on hours or days off
bad,Management micromanages you and they‚Äôre incompetent. Constant being lied to and they have layed off 4 times to my knowledge in my 4 years being here. The ceo is a blood sucker and keeps adding to your work list without giving you help.
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs has many problems and takes negative managing to employees, which reflects to customers. Bad pay, no benafits. Lowe‚Äôs should be ashamed of how poor they treat there employees.  No teamwork. No coaching. No manger is qualified to lead because of no training."
bad,The company doesn‚Äôt care about ya what so ever they close out positions without thinking twice worked 11yrs laid off without any kind of notice !! Just leaves a bad taste in your mouth
bad,bully administration. unfair treatment in general. plays favorites.  unreasonable work schedule. heavy lifting every day. store manager works hard not to see bad stuff and is seldom there. customers observe he sweeps floors rather than deal with situation. high employee turnover.
bad,"When I first started working for Lowe's, back on March 2007, it took alot to get fired. They were very concerned for job security. Now with the new CEO, it isn't worth working for this company. Lowe's is extremely a LAME company to work for.  With the new CEO, I think Lowe's is going to go out of business. He took away overtime,  employees bonuses, air conditioning sucks in the building now. Customers left every day because of how hot it is in the store"
bad,Hard work poor pay. Rotating shift makes it hard to plan life around. Poor training from the managers. As long as you get along with the manager you are good but raise an issue or concern and you become expendable.
bad,A typical day at Lowe's would greatly depend on what department you worked in. Some where very different as far as job resposiblites. My former position was one with a variety of many tasks that were way to much for such a small group of people (my team). Management is horrible. And there is no room for advancement. I would describe the place as being like a high school. Way to many clicks.
bad,i hated working at lowes and would never want anyone i know to work at this very poor company. they would never schedule me on the right days that i needed off and was overlooked for a promotion not because of knowledge of my department but because someone was there longer than me. I am an Electrician and was not given the promotion in the Electrical department and the other person was not an Electrician.
bad,I worked for 14yrs for this company and in a drop of a hat the cut my position off no aportunity to move or apply for other jobs simply gone now I have to start over
bad,If you ask for help you won‚Äôt get it. The managers sit and talk in the office all day (not meetings). The amount of people who do nothing outnumbers the actual workers. The front end managers and their best buddies can do no wrong (they do nothing). The new people are seeing this place for what it is and leaving pretty quick! If you ask questions or need help you are a trouble maker.
bad,I worked as seasonal and management sabotaged my employment as season got close to ending by changing my schedule and not letting me know. Management is terrible and the people there aren't worth a thing. Pay was not worth working outside in 100+ degree weather and everything about that job is terrible.
bad,"Customers leaving store with out any help in flooring while the specialist regularly slept half his shift on the sofa in the break room. Wake him up and you are not a team player."
bad,Don‚Äôt work there! They will promise you certain schedules and then don‚Äôt give it to you. They let the customers treat you any type of way. The pay is low.
bad,The absolute worst job I've ever had. Constantly understaffed and management is the absolute worst. Ive had managers completely ignore me. I've had the STORE MANAGER completely blow me off twice. If you care about your mental wellbeing don't work for lowes.
bad,Management does not help you at all. Schedule stinks because it is all over the place one day open next day close. Managers are never around when you need one.
bad,"One manager followed the hourly employees around telling snapple facts he read off the bottle caps. Another manager critisized EVERYTHING I did. "
bad,"Where to begin, this ‚Äúcompany‚Äù, is a swirling mix of colors of nonsense, followed by hypocrisy, with a dash of false hoods, the management is fully untrustworthy; that will walk all over you and say what ever they can, seriously this is the place of retail rejects."
bad,"lowes was the worst place i have EVER worked for, so many rude people, management was a joke. and trying to get consistent hours... well good luck. i have had several 17 hour days and they fought you on your pay, several times they didnt want to pay me for my work and fought it every step of the way when management would ask you to stay over and help. lowes is also known for keeping around lazy and incompetent employees and loading up the good ones with more work than anyone could handle then get mad when the employee cant handle it"
bad,Was never comfortable working there you just never knew when someone was going to accuse you of something they did and blamed you and you could prove it was not you but because they were a favorite it did not matter
bad,"Very bad place to work management is terrible nobody cares until something happen they will constantly lie about everything can't trust no one in the store very unorganized vehicles are unsafe total waste of time for any Class A truck driver fooling with this company you can possibly lose your license because no one wants to fix anything all equipment is old and out of date "
bad,One of the worse jobs I've ever had. Enough said. Everything is so wrong and stressful that I can't wait to leave this place. Never again will I apply here.I only gave it a one star because I couldn't give it zero stars.
bad,"very very selfish company. use it to build a resume not a career or life. dead end job 100%. they do not care about you , a lot of managers do nothing."
bad,Overworked and under paid. Cant keep a full staff of people willing to work. Its not set up very well and management doesn't really care about the problems with the job. Management not willing to go to bat for their employees when they have issues or problems.
bad,"I originally worked at the store at the very beginning. I lasted just over a year. It was more like a coffin for me. I had plenty of struggles personally in my life outside of work. I was a full time employee. I was let go roughly 3 years ago. A incident happened at the store where I made a call to the authorities. Figuring I was doing the right thing. Apparently it was the wrong thing to do. "
bad,They treat you like they do not care about the employees and they promise you and dont follow through with it and they make you do other people job and yell at you for nothing
bad,I worked at Lowe‚Äôs for over 7 years and I would rather be shot than have to go back to work at Lowe‚Äôs. I have never been so stressed out at a job as I was there. The company treats you like robots and they kick you to the curb when they‚Äôre done with you.
bad,"It's ok if you never want to be advanced...If you start out on the front end then that's where you will be 20 yrs from now because , they only allow the brown nosers to move forward..."
bad,very tense and stressful  customers and mangers was not treated fairly discrimination pay was good just not worth the stress would not recommend to my worst enemy
bad,"Management will embarrass you in front of customers if you do something wrong,  I forgot to remind a customer about a survey on their receipt and manager made sure to call me out on it, there were several incidents and customers overheard and they would tell me how sorry those people are .. certain clicks can stand around and talk to each other, text on their ph, do FaceTime and I‚Äôm told to grab a broom, clean, stay busy. I will never work at this one ever again, too much prejudice and I was stressed out everyday"
bad,They need to go out of business it‚Äôs a very bad place to work I would never work there again this place is ran like slavery and they don‚Äôt care about no one but there self
bad,"Probably the most unethical company you could work for. Managers treat everyone differently and discrimination happens daily.  Most managers are hard workers that were promoted and the others are people that walk circles all day and have no idea what they are doing.  All in all....do not apply at Lowe's, do yourself a favor and work somewhere else.  Don't give a company time that you are going to wish you never had.  I have been here 12 years and I am miserable everyday but there are not many jobs in my rural area. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!!"
bad,"Since i have worked for the company..... i have been able to obtain my forklift license, order picker licences, and star wars. I am able to work alone in 9 different departments from lumber, outdoor power equipment, loader, sales rep, appliance department, paint department, receiving department and cleaning appliances. However once a raise was requested and employees wanted better pay. The company and the managers turned the opposite way. Their is no security mutiple merchandise has been stolen, during the day and overnight. Upset customers have all apologized after having a encounter with me, because of my great customer service.  However the company doesn't treat employees right at all. Instead of paying properly and being respectful its the complete opposite. Hardest part of the job is handling 6customers by myself, loading 3 customers purchased appliances, while answering calls for my department, and making sure that the merchandise is not being tolen or abused all at one time."
bad,"Easily the job I regret giving my time the most. "
bad,"Just another company out for themselves and their own pocket book."
bad,"The pay is the same as 10 years ago, low!!! The only people who do well there are the managers best buddies. If yoga brown noser you can sit and chitchat all day in the office. If you actually work but need a little help occasionally get ready to be written up or fired. They keep lazy good for nothings and let good workers leave for better pay. IDIOTS"
bad,"At my store, the managers had a very bad attitude and lackluster work ethic. They did not lead well at all but when the morale was low and their staff wasn't very motivated, they would be very nasty and condescending. The main store manager actually told me at one point that he didn't do my annual review because he decided I don't deserve a raise. If he really felt that way about me, I don't understand why he didn't just do my review and talk to me about the issues he has with me so I have something to work on. They don't give positive feedback and constructive criticism. They just either like and you get away with whatever or they don't like you and they treat you horribly. Very toxic work environment."
bad,"very stressful chaotic scheduling. rotates every 2 weeks. 99% of time when you request off it is denied. Most people just call in sick."
bad,"To make a long story short I worked in the electrical department for roughly 8 months, during the month of November one coworker suffered a heart attack (of which he unfortunately did not make it) while the other quit altogether after being frustrated by management. I was left to cover the entire department by myself for the whole month with little to no help. Then on Black Friday of all days I was suddenly told that I was being let go for not making sales numbers, I'm one person so how on Earth can I make the numbers!?"
bad,"Lowes may be a great place to work but not this location. I went through 3 top dogs, 6 second in commands , 4 third in commands and whole bunch of supervisors in less than 8 months. Every time I came back from a day off, several people had quite yet again. The high rate of shop lifters at this store is ridiculous. Also I have never worked anywhere where there are so many rude and horrible customers in my life. So if you choose to work here be ready to work all weekends ( you get one off a month, Ha I laugh out loud, Lies ) Your schedule changes all the time. Days nights what ever. The bathrooms in this facility are disgusting as well as the breakroom with over flowing garbage and the smell of dead rats in the ceiling! Don't get me wrong there are some very nice people that work here but unless you want to pick up the slack for those that choose to sluff off or quit everyday. You're not going to like it here. Plus you get that big raise for all of your hard work of whopping $.0.14 cents. WOW!"
bad,"I was a full time seasonal worker which means part time or whatever hours they give you based on store and department needs. I started in shipping/receiving and went to flooring, cross trained into electrical, millworks (doors and windows) and lumber/building materials. Some weeks you would get almost full time hours then when sales would slow down when the seasonal visitors left then you would get less hours. I got laid off for no reason since seasonal is the worst hiring category but I had to work. I since went to home depot better overall company. The managers are all micro managers and they say they focus on customer service when they really don't. They do hire veterans which I'm a three time veteran of the marines, and army national guard. I would not recommend working for lowes unless you want to be micro managed like a high school kid. People call off all the time that's how I picked up most of my hours. The corporate structure just changed from an 80 percent full time to 50-60 percent full time and 40 to 50 percent part time or seasonal. I worked for lowes in yuma, arizona years ago. The company as a whole is a lot worse and I would not work for them again."
bad,"Managers not interested in the employees, only care about the numbers.  Changing schedules without notification.  Poor management, favoritism.  Fun co-workers, great family to work with.  Interacting with the customers was the best part of the day.  Being understaffed is a typical day at Lowes."
bad,Lack of  professionalism  and workers are very disrespectful they never gave us breaks and sometimes they forced us to take short lunches and they would get there full hr lunch and only work 4 hours
bad,Managers don‚Äôt have any idea what is going on. They cover theirselves by saying corporate told them. They don‚Äôt communicate and won‚Äôt stick up for an employee
bad,It wasn‚Äôt  my favorite place to work. They were rude and inconsiderate. I enjoyed it but i applied for a part time and they had me working 10 hr shifts.
bad,"Terrible place to work, very hard system and they don‚Äôt train you well. They never tell you about sales and customers are rude and treat you like garbage. Had to clock in 5 min before your shift so if traffic had you late you were looking to get in trouble. Head cashier‚Äôs are extremely rude and wont help out even though you need them through out the day to change prices and such. Never changed sale prices in the system hence why you needed head cashier. Wasn‚Äôt  allowed for bathroom breaks. My advice don‚Äôt work here!"
bad,"Daily typical day at Lowes was very poor when it came to communication and skilled training by head cashier and managers!"
bad,"Beside the summary above, Lowe's management is clueless on how their employees do their job. Support is horrible, and getting help from coworkers is close to impossible as they are kept short-staffed in their departments. Management sits in an office all day and is snobbish on a good day."
bad,Middle school drama. Management is a joke. I dont understand how you can feel good about yourself making others feel bad. You're not a true leader.  I asked the store manager for a raise. He SNICKERED and covered his mouth and told me no.
bad,Not a place to work at you get hours but not enough the pay is fine the management is not good and u don‚Äôt get a set schedule if u do work at Lowe‚Äôs I require to apply for millwork
bad,"This started out as a great job. The lack of manager and support really made it hard to do anything. The ASM of my department  never helped in anyway other then push my teams apart. As an ASM you should never sleep with your associates, He did!. Even when i brought this to the store manager is was pushed under the rug!! 0417 really left a spoiled taste in my life when it comes to Lowes."
bad,Lowe's at lease the store I worked at was a very stressful environment. The favoritism is very noticeable. The old store manager did have an open door police and was very understanding and helpful to his employees. Unfortunately he left and the new store manager was a lost puppy.
bad,Do  not work here. After 12 years the company has turned into constant threats and leading by intimidation.  Not the place you wqnt to be. It sux unless you just don't care.
bad,"they really need to get some new people in their to run the place because it is poorly managed and they need better people to clean the place up, to many pest"
bad,i had gotten hurt at work and then ultimately fired do to not being able to do my job for a month and more due to work restrictions my doctor had given me and they used the excuse I was seasonal so they were aloud to do so. So Lowe's is a terrible place to try and build a career
bad,"The head cashiers play favorites. They let their faves pretty much tell them when they want to work and when they need off. The deplorables ask off even weeks in advance and are denied that day needed off, but yet faves have been known to ask for a day off two days prior and they are allowed. And they give faves the best hours. It‚Äôs like high school all over again."
bad,"I worked at lowes, and i would stand in the lane where the cashier station was like where i was assigned and i would be there until i had a customer. I liked working there because i would get hours but i would be standing alot"
bad,"It is a excellent place to work for.  Mentioning the great customers, co-workers, and the best satisfaction if when customers needs are met.  It is was a nice experience."
bad,"Pay is low, management manages to wait for decisions to come from on high, employee turnover is very high and the schedule is not the same week to week. The only reason people stay at Lowe's is that it's almost impossible to get fired."
bad,Lowes sets their schedule up so that you have zero work life balance.  I was working three different shifts a week with no real rhythm to them.  I felt like they did not care about their employees.
bad,"Management does not care about their employees. Terribly understaffed, and hours are always being cut. You will hardly ever get a break, and when you do managers hover until you leave the break room. You are told that you‚Äôll get two weekends off a month, but that rarely ever happens. Managers play favorites all the time. Poor job culture and very little teamwork; most employees are unwilling to help out others."
bad,"The management at Lowe‚Äôs is terrible and they only care for themselves. If you had a problem they would act like they care but wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it. All they care about it money. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have personal issues going on or family emergencies, they‚Äôll fire you for it."
bad,"don‚Äôt waste your time working for Lowe‚Äôs . your not allowed to get overtime, your schedule is inconsistent you can work from 9am to 8pm you barely see your family, you work on holidays, the pay isn‚Äôt that good & the management sucks."
bad,"The management will make you look bad in front of customers in order to please them, even if it goes against all company policies.  Coworkers were lazy and did not help one another. Customers are rude and will talk down to you like you are from another planet.  It was all around a bad experience."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs hired us because of our experience related to our job specifications but wouldn‚Äôt utilize our experience. Too much unnecessary paperwork. Brought up ways to improve efficiency, Lowes not interested."
bad,"I worked at Lowe's full-time for more than 4 years"
bad,"Managers will completely and blatantly ignore their employees' concerns and ideas. They constantly hire people while cutting the hours of those who already work there. Also, good luck ever getting ahold of a manager if you ever need one."
bad,"Expect a short term of employment. Brutal, Hard labor. Quota is more important than safety. Many injuries.  Inconvenient Mandatory Overtime 9 months of a year. No Unions allowed. Misguided immature ops managers scrambling to experiment with efficiency. Sordid miserable work environment.high turnover rate.  Ops Management is antagonistic instead of supportive.Not a permanent job. Don't waste your time or your back. This company needs a labor Union to cut down on abuses by management."
bad,They will hire you for a job position and after you start they put you anywhere they want. The call off rate is mind blowing as this is why people have to constantly fill in. I would not recommend this place for employment to anyone!  All full time employees get an hour for lunch unless you‚Äôre a delivery driver. Drivers never get a lunch break but you must dock your self 30 minutes every day if you get a break or not.
bad,They don‚Äôt even get one star in my opinion but it won‚Äôt allow anything below. Poor management. They argue and in turn take it out on us because they can‚Äôt agree so we get nowhere in that job/position because they all tell you to do it their way instead of agreeing to one way. They all don‚Äôt get along which makes our job harder. They could use all new management especially store manager. Employees just don‚Äôt have much of a chance here to make a good living.
bad,Don't waste your time!! The management sucks and you'll go nowhere in the business. If you are part-time the manager will make it his mission that you dont get full time.
bad,"The most unprofessional, unorganized training system. Not at all new hire friendly, Specifically management. It is commonly considered unprofessional for a manager to give a new hire instructions and not even introduce him/herself or "
bad,"I'm sure Lowe's as a company is great. However the specific store I worked at was toxic and always a train wreck. Always understaffed and employees were overwhelmed and overworked. If you did something or said something the petty management...which changed twice in the less than 2 years I was there....would retaliate. You were supposed to, at times, cover as many as 3 or 4 departments at a time. Which is near impossible. And you would be reprimanded if you didn't. The management has absolutely no clue how to manage people or a store for that matter. I've never seen such a poorly run location."
bad,I like the environment. I also like my responsibility. I am happy to serve customer here. All employee are friendly minded and so helpful. My supervisor encourages me a alot.
bad,"Don't work here. Managers only look after their own needs, and if they can throw you under the bus to better themselves, they will. This place is too competitive to succeed."
bad,I was hired on as seasonal and it was so bad that I quit after a week and a half. No breaks if you do what they want you to do at the pace they want you to work. the corporate rah rah sounds good but they follow through with nothing and place all the blame on the employees if the store doesn't make its numbers. They are the Walmart of the home improvement business trying to squeeze the life out of their employees using sociopathic techniques. I can believe people work their at all.
bad,I worked there for 4 months full time as a delivery helper and let me tell you they abuse their workers to the fullest. The never organized the trucks properly and they always ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to add someone‚Äôs order once you were finished. Expect to work 12 hrs or more a day and to have no personal life at all. Hated this place
bad,"Started as seasonal then once the time was up became part time. I love everyone I work with but it has changed from when I started. So many employees left for either moving or other jobs. "
bad,"2789 unfortunately has unprofessional management practices and abuse their positions, consistently harass and threaten associates!  Managers get time off two consecutive days and associates get split days off, associates can‚Äôt take off on a Monday or Friday and associates work different departments without any training!  I am sure not all the stores operate this way!"
bad,"Management is completely inffective, blantantly lies to your dace expecting you to never know, and acts as if they have done nothing wrong as they make a mockery of your professional career."
bad,"New ceo has changed everything.     Used to be a great place to work, now, not so much. Wish the higher ups would listen to the little guys and what it takes to run a store."
bad,"Worst management ever!   I worked for lowes for 11yrs with no raise in 4 yrs. New management is the worst!  I put in for night ops manager and was lied to as to why i was not considered after working night crew for 11yrs.  This is what upper management said. That i lacked leadership. That I had anger issues, and I don't get done my departments and help out other departments. This is a complete lie! Everyone that I work with knows this is not true. I don't have anger issues. I always get done my departments and help out others. New hires and current coworkers come to me for advice and help. I truly am a leader based on new highers and coworkers. My manager comes to me for help frequently also."
bad,"Worst company to work for ever dont work for them its a miserable experience all around, long hours, horrible managers, stupid co-workers as well as customers."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was listening to all the associates complain about management and unable to do anything. The staff in new roles do NOT get trained adequately. Management yells at the staff quite often in front of customers. Very unprofessional. Management doesn't communicate or if they do, they are all on different pages."
bad,This was a second job and when interviewed for the position I told them I had another job. They said this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem they would work around my schedule. Every week I had a problem with my schedule that conflicted with my primary job. They never scheduled me during the times I told them I could work. I printed off my schedule and marked all the days that did not work with my other schedule. They told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry we will fix it‚Äù  yeah they weren‚Äôt fixed. They left me on the schedule as a no call no show when a manager told me it would be fixed. I worked harder than anyone when I was there. Poor management. Poor scheduling.
bad,Don't be a flatbed driver or delivery driver at lowes. The first thing they do is lie to you what your job responsibilities are. Your always pull in your own lumber loads to deliver when your supposed to have a puller for that and get used to work in 12 to 13 hours a day average and kiss your weekends goodbye 1 weekend a month. Then your punished with 6 days 1 off 4 days 1 off 4 days 2 off 3 days 2 and rotation starts again. It suacks you never rest. Customers are always pied off cause salespeople always overpromise and under deliver. I repeat never work at lowes.
bad,"wages are so so, very poor management, work with full time employees that are lazy and to stupid to get a real job, a lot of worthless young full time employees that will make you do all the work while they stand around flapping their jaws, early morning start times, work part time and Lowes tries to give you full time hours, the overturn of employees is unbelievable they can't keep people"
bad,If you are in the favor of the district manager Scott b. You will go far even if you are ineffective and not good at your job. But once he dislikes you it doesn't matter if you are there every day and you exceeded expectations... You will be gone. Mid level management not paid near enough to do what's expected. Plan on working 70 plus hours with no work life balance. This company doesn't do anything it tells you they will. Stay away unless you want to feel nothing anymore then feel free to apply.
bad,"Lowes  does not care if you're  part-time. ""the training  is not the best  at all the mangers  want  u to care  about the store but when it comes down to it "" the managers don't  care about the store !!!!!! they don't care  if there under staffed , the employees that work, part time  need to know there's some security within the job  and they don't get that !! however if u need a lunch good luck with  getting  one  Or going  to the  bathroom! !! Wake up mangers  at Lowe's! !!!  This is why the good people  quit.... It's sad cause  I like the work Lowe's  was fun  and the co -workers were great!!  But Lowe's  needs  to CARE  about  all there  part time employees...."
bad,Terrible place to work. management has no idea what is going on in their own store. All they care about are numbers not making sure things run smoothly. there are NEVER enough people there to get the job done. They will tell you to figure something out and then yell at you over your solution.
bad,"I was hired on as seasonal to work in Garden area. The hours sucked, and the managers didn't care a thing about you! I was a watered the plants early in the morning for 9 months. 7 days week. No days off. When other employees stand around and did nothing.  They water the plants soo much that they kill them from over watering.  And if you dont drown them they get on to you for not watering enough.  They lose more plants over watering them then if they didn't water at all. My advice to ANYONE WHO THINKS THEY WOULD ENJOY working at Lowe's think AGAIN!! GO ELSEWHERE!! you will thank me later."
bad,"You work your butt off for 12 bucks an hour. They think they own you! Don't you dare stand up for yourself! They will call you into the manager's office, and tag team you like you are a murder suspect."
bad,Worst job I‚Äôve had. I show up just for a paycheck. No leadership or training what so ever. If you wanna know something you need to research your self as does everyone else you work with so you really can‚Äôt ask co workers for help as they too are undertrained. Google is your trainer in a basic sense so if your not familiar with how to use it then your out of luck.  The interface they is to run the store is archaic and in need of a update that will never come. The vacation days you do get will be denied to the point where you loose them the following year . Schedule is so inconsistent they change it without proper notification so you will be surprised to find out you don‚Äôt have hours when you try to clock in but if you want to use vacation you need to give them 30 days notice only for them to deny it. No incentive to make sales since you will only make compensation during certain events. Meetings are repetitive lectures with no feedback or discussion. Emails are expected to be read but you will get no reply‚Äôs if you have a concern.  Certain managers are fixtures in the break room.
bad,"Absolutely the worse place I have ever worked..The management team is absolutely horrible and the store was always understaffed.. Terrible employees cause they're attitudes were terrible towards the customers...Just an awful store 1721 in Southaven,Ms"
bad,Worst job I've ever had. Would not wish workin there on my worst enemy. Customer service is terrible because there short staffed and managers are terrible and treat employees awful
bad,I regret that I was even consider Lowe's as an employer. And I don't really care if it will shut down tomorrow. It doesn't do much for the community anyway. They selling consumers bad products.
bad,"Very few positions are allowed a set schedule, those that are pay lower then most others in company yet are often the most difficult jobs. They demand you work on other tasks other then your assigned job and still expect you to have all of your work done as well. Tasks that would also require additional assistance to complete however they refuse to assist you or find someone to assist you."
bad,Overnight manger is about as qualified as a rock. Working nights means that the day associates place all the blame on you when something is messed up and they leave all the work they don‚Äôt want to do for the night crew. Unreasonable amount of workload for minimum pay. Management spends majority of their time flirting with the cashiers so good luck trying to get a question answered.
bad,most of the work is seasonal or part time. The hours are from 4am-1pm three days a week. The crew I worked with was very nice. If you just need a couple of dollars and don't mind busting your back at a ridiculous time of 4am then it's for you.
bad,Been called racist names by managers as well as human resources had to call my states employment office long story short if your a person of color I would not spend my hard earned money at Lowe's you will probably get a used appliance or something that has been returned and resold to you.not only that Lowe's employees will call you raciest names behind your back so do not shop or work at Lowe's they are racist as well as very sneaky and low down
bad,Not a great company to work for. Terrible hours and pay. Shifts are always changing and the rotation is terrible. O am 9n a two days off in 14 day schedule.
bad,I loved what i did but we got a new manager and then the store went down hill he doesn't know what he is doing and just a horrible planner qith up coming stuff
bad,Poor environment. The people were superficially friendly. I stayed because the pay was very good. I got along with management. It was easy to get killed by lazy forklift operators.
bad,"Typical day was putting everything that came in on the truck away (onto the selling space). I learned that the store has no rhyme or reasoning as to why items are placed where they are. Management was a nightmare to deal with, because they didnt ever leave the office to check on the ""floor"". Hardest part of the job was trying to place overstock items into the overhead, there was litteraly nowhere to put items, but it still had to go into the overhead. Most enjoyable part was the louesy paycheck every two weeks."
bad,"Extremely poor management without oversight. Overwhelming workload and unrealistic expectations. I'm looking for a new job, not looking to expound on why Lowrs sucks."
bad,"Keller TX the worst management I have ever had in my Career,No Training At all Miss treat seasonal Employees. treat you like one of Vicks dogs. Human Recourse is a bad joke. Supervisor didn't no anything and was very belligerent to employees and did very little if any work.People who work there are nice but. The way they treat their employees and the low pay don't do it>"
bad,Expectations are way too high or unreasonable. Schedule is all over the place even for people that have been there for years. Management loves to bark orders without ample time to complete the task.
bad,"I would rather stay unemployed than to work for Lowe‚Äôs, you would make more money. I have given Lowe‚Äôs 5 years of my time and have nothing to show for it."
bad,"I was both a cashier and a garden associate. You're paid very little for literal backbreaking work, customers consistently treat you like scum, and management won't have your back as they only care about their year end bonus for good survey ratings. So they will suck up to any customer and throw their associates under the bus."
bad,"basically, it was garbage. constantly on your feet running around like a chicken with your head cut off trying to do everything at once, unless you're stuck during ""power hours"" where you can't stock the shelves or do anything but wait hand and foot on unappreciative customers. "
bad,"Other workers stood around while management let it happen and when we were short on staff, it felt like I was always pushed to overexert myself for the absence of workers for a wage that didn't even compare or add up to my efforts."
bad,"management was bad ,people always taking credit for your work when your not there, could never accomodate for emergencies or days off needed, they just say you work or you get written up"
bad,"Bad place to work, find a trade stay away if possible. Poor management, lied to constantly, treated like cattle and constantly harassed by management. People would try to transfer to other stores but we‚Äôre told the manager had called and told not to hire them. Most of the people that had been there for years treated badly in hopes they would leave hired inexperienced people at a lower rate to cut overhead."
bad,One of worst place to work. Management doesn't know how to run everything. Too many lazy worker and management doesn't care. hardest part is no matter how fast you are and they will give you more work than others. I leave there to avoid doing all the works there and refused to give me raise pay and part time.
bad,"I thought i was working for a company that respect there employees. That's not the case with this company. There is favoritism, it doesn't matter how long you have been with the company and how hard you work they will still choose the next person over you."
bad,"Lowe's has lots of things in the right place, if they actually did what they said, I would have a different opinion. Even if It did not go well for me, I am honest, fair. I was harrased and bullied, was prevented from any action that would result in promotion. They have a good old boy system in place that will mostlikely be the source or their demise, unless the new CEO Marvin can put a stop to rigging the polls, managers have the power to 'cook the books' and this keeps the upper management from being aware of serious HR problems untill it is far to late. For example, an associate who instead of doing his job, would follow me around all day, and would jump out aand scare me, then take a picture of me in condescending snap chats and the whole store was laughing at me without my knowledge. THey did not give me any chance to defend myself, when I got angry I was fired. That goes against their own policies, which happens quite often, sadly. They do have many things going for them, that if they could fix their personel,, they would jump to the front in many ways. Sadly, I am not a isolated incidence, many others, fearing they wont get another job, are afraid to say anything. They got rid of the HR folks, so a person with a disorder like myself was suddenly left without a safety net, the mid managers being a large part of the problem, there was no way for me to get any kind of help, there used to be, but removing HR in our store was a terrible oversight. Not keeping their own policies and outright dishonesty should never be rewarded. Allowing a hard worker to be harrassed, and not"
bad,"HR representative at lowes phillipsburg its the most non professional person,dont help employee in any aspect,assistant manager are the most inexpert and they are nothing professional and bad humor"
bad,"The managers buddies get to wander in as late as they want and leave as early as they like. Anyone else gets written up. The pay isn‚Äôt enough to eat and make a decent car payment. Don‚Äôt worry about raises, they will not happen."
bad,"I took the job at Lowes for the money.  it wasn't worth it.  Turn over is high, job satisfaction is low, and corporate dictates your schedule."
bad,the overnight management is absolutely horrendous no one cares about the employees as long as they are getting money in the companies pockets. They don't car.
bad,"The management sucked, the corporate system can‚Äôt keep up with their own policies. You were under paid and run the place with no help. Manager asked you to not contact her."
bad,"Was a very busy place.Enjoyed the various parts of the job and multi tasking in customer service. Answered the phone and redirected calls"
bad,"horrible place to work..terrible, hypocrites, don't care about employees, milk u to the bone, ridiculous policies and procedures. u cant make a living working here"
bad,"Lack of employees, inability to keep employees working there, extremely poor management, no organization or team work between days or nights or members of other departments E.X. Night Stockers and Floor Associates. They expect to much for to little pay. Raises are supposed to be annual but you only get them if you mention that you haven't gotten your raise and it could be months before you even get it after that."
bad,nice place to work but you will get bored easy not much to really do and can seem like the days drag on but the workers are all so nice and the mangers are nice
bad,Company is a true example of a poorly managed. Inexperienced staff are promoted as leaders.Absolute worst place I have ever worked! They do not care about any of their employees.
bad,"just another dead end job. dont waste your time. "
bad,You can only advance if you are in the clique. Know matter how much you know it is who you know to advance. The management advances only the people they know. A lot of people were demoted and the management replaced them with their friends.  As I was told by a  ASM....we don't want you ‚Ä¶.we are going in a new direction.
bad,"You have to prove yourself to succeed in this company. Then once that moment you slow down, all h*** breaks loose with you and the managers. It does not matter if you bend over backwards for this company, at the end they will screw you over. Managers have to much power. Managers thinks low of you. Oh and when someone spends a lot of money at your store. You don't work for lowes any longer. Your working for the most money spender. If that spender doesn't like you. Believe me lowes will fire you on the spot. Also if your a big talker, you can get some much in discounted items. Also the customers gets more discounts than the employees do. The biggest thing. Over time is history. No ot allowed on the floor. That means more money for the managers. One last thing. , the new employees get so much more money than the people already working there. This place will tear you down in a heartbeat. I would think twice before appling!"
bad,"No support from managers, lack of communication, managers talks about employees with other employees, favoritism bad in the work place, no one want to out work the other"
bad,Never work there if you are better then working at a 2 bit hardeware store and its pretty rascist.terrible terrible place to work a waist of time. If i had to do it again i wouldnt
bad,"I did not have a good experience working for Lowe's. As a part of the night stocking team I was responsible for filling the shelves with product before the store opened for business. If we were unable to finish a truck in time then day shift was responsible for taking care of whatever was left over. However, day shift didn't stock anything, and that meant that night shift would have to take care of both a brand new truck, as well as whatever was leftover from the previous one from the night before."
bad,"Not the company it once was when it valued it's employees as a valued asset."
bad,Very poor management. Too much favoritism. Need a better management team and Hr person. I would not recomend lowes to anyone. Work schedule sucks they say they rotate your shifts but for some reason I'm always closing.
bad,this place needs alot of help. They have no body that is good at the job cause they just throw people into a spot and tell them just to do it. the management team don't listen to anyone.
bad,"the new way things are done is horrible. Management is horrible, we have managers that can't even run a cash register. The company doesn't care about the employees and only ab out making money."
bad,"Upper management is filled with unqualified and marginally ethical people."
bad,They wanted me to deliver on a loader pay. While drivers earned double. I applied multiple times to the driver position and they would never hire for driver. I was a back up driver for 2 years on a loader salary. 10 per hour driver position paid 20+ I refused to deliver and they fired me.
bad,A great place to work. Work place culture is normal. Never a dull day. There's nothing good or bad to tell. Management has change through-out the years
bad,"Very Poor Management - very clicky place to work.  If your not part of the in crowd then it is not a fun place tp work."
bad,Management is very poor. They have their favorites. Not enough working hours per week.  I would not recommend working here. No room for advancement. Co-workers were nice.
bad,"If you‚Äôre a cashier forget getting breaks. If you are a head cashier forget breaks, getting a full lunch break or going to the bathroom. The managers cannot be bothered to help you or the customers. They are far too busy talking on cell phones or chatting with their buddies. If you haven‚Äôt been their for a decade you are wrong, in everything. If you are from a decade ago, you are perfect and do no wrong. Managers only talk to the peons to degrade or nitpick. The high scores given are done by the managers. Those scores are LIES!"
bad,"Drama, favoritism, and horrible managers. Worked overnight. The work was repetitive nothing hard about stocking merchandise. It was the lack of advancment that was the problem. If you didn't kiss up to managers you would be denied promotions. They would rather higher from outside the store than a good worker within the store because they didn't like you."
bad,"Great stock option, the training is good and it is room for advancement. They give you a chance to learn more about the company. They really invest in customer service."
bad,"wouldn't go back, the job was boring, the employees are snobby. the managers don't speak to you. I work there 3 months and the store manager would come stand behind me and never once spoke to me or introduced himself to me."
bad,"It was a no win situation for someone who had no prior experience with Lowe's or retail."
bad,"The company is highly disorganized and siloed; most departments are totally unaware and disregard the projects and initiatives. Executive management is disconnected with middle management; decisions are made at the top frequently without regard or consultation with middle management, ultimately affecting the underlying workers. Constant hire/fire and shifting of positions, teams, workloads, etc. "
bad,The management is for them selves.  They rather get rid of you to save money on team members if they get to a certain point in of there service.then if they don't like you you are gone if you are a butt kisser you stay!
bad,The Manager over me decided that he didn't like the way I worked harder than everyone else in the department and decided that he would find some hole in the system to remove me through
bad,The management is really bad and wouldn't give a schedule around your life which is annoying and stupid. Some of them aren't every nice and give you an attitude if you ask to change schedule around work and life.
bad,I will never tell anyone in their right mind to work here. It's not worth it. The pay is awful the employees and mangers attitudes are nasty. I admit its a clean store but I would never tell anyone to work here.
bad,low management input not friendly low to little oppurunity for advancement safe working conditions short handed in some departments not enough training
bad,They did not support the position. I worked there for 10 years and felt that I was running a construction company for them. I would be required to generate leads for myself go to the appointment hopefully sell it using their overpriced system and then order all the material while making sure the delivery went out on time. And the customer complaints were endless from the incompentent installers they were hiring to do these projects.
bad,"As weekend maintenance working 12 1/2 hour shifts this was by far the worst place I have ever worked. From day 1 they are looking for a reason to fire you. Safety is a good thing don't get me wrong but they take it to a level of shear stupidity. The pay sucked but I needed a job. I only stayed until something better came along. They have HIGH turnover in maintenance, so if you are looking for a long term career don't waste your time unless you're desperate. I worked with great people and made friends was the only pro here."
bad,"Just don‚Äôt work at New Hartford location, That place is a sinking ship that no one can save. They don‚Äôt care about the people they hire at all and will let you go when ever they feel."
bad,"The management was rude, the job felt more like slavery then a job. i was a cashier, and experienced way too many restrictions on the job. I wasn't allowed to walk too far away from the register without being scolded, i had to ask to go to the restroom sometimes i would be left waiting to go for hours, because i couldn't get a manager to answer the phone. Almost all of the managers were bias to specific employees over others, and would allow their favorites to get away with breaking rules on the job. I hated the job very much, and i would not recommend anyone working there for their mental sanity."
bad,Worse and best job ever.  Lowes is a great company to work for. The lack of management support is a huge issue. Oh there are managers but they don't help.
bad,they suck as a company they think that you oue them something dont work for then they well try to make you fill bad about working there the popple are hat you
bad,"Management is a joke, They don't know how to treat people as humans. The decisions made are all about the store managers bonus, not what is best for the customer."
bad,When I worked on the night crew as the delivery puller things started great and the manager loved the work I performed. After about a month I could not even make it through the door and have time to clock in before the manager was paging me and asking how much time I could afford to help his crew. After I started to ignore him until I clocked in he began treating me like I never did any work. Once  I went part time evenings it was simply him going around telling everyone I talked all the time and never did any work. Another manager jumped on the bandwagon because I never involved myself in the drama and would page for me by name over the intercom any time a page went out for help in any department near mine. Stay far away unless to thrive on drama and playing games with management. Anyone who treats others the same as the managers will get raises fast to be making a few dollars an hour more than you within a year but not know how to do their job.
bad,"Management seems to contradict company policies, create issues that can easily be avoided, and you must learn to work around them rather than rely on them. Work culture is filled with bigoted people who say inappropriate things and lack understanding of other cultures and groups of people."
bad,Don't recommend anyone top apply here. They create lazy people and management doesn't help successful associates. Managers will team up to get you out of a job.
bad,Discrimination with employees. Harassment and managers do not work at all. No accountability held from Store Manager to his ASM. ASM aren't loyal to their job duties. Pass customers off to other employees so they don't have to work.
bad,"No holidays, extreme hours, horrible campus. More back biting and poor management than I ever thought possible from a large company."
bad,"Lowe's was very busy. I was never bored. I gave it everything I had. Some managers great and others not so much. Loved the customers and my co-workers. Lowes was flexible with my schedule at the beginning but then a new manager came in and wasn't flexible at all. I would still be there if they had more flexible. I was injured from a pre-existing condition and this made it hard for me to lift beyond 50bls, but the company didn't seam to want to help me with my request to lower the length of my shifts without going to the surgeon from 2 years prior to have proof."
bad,My review is do not apply here if you are in school. They would over work me so much to the point where I had to repeat college and lost financial aid because they would keep me so long and scheduled me on my off days that I requested.
bad,"Worked there for almost 7 years and at first it was a great company that paid well. After about the 3rd year it started to go down hill. They kept all the power hungry managers that don‚Äôt make changes and are incredibly lazy. You get no support or help when needed. They wanted to fill up the work place with a bunch of part timers who don‚Äôt care about being there. It‚Äôs the full time employees that need the job and need to put food on their table and they have yet to give a decent yearly raise. Some people were getting $.10 for their yearly raise! This company is a joke and I can see it declining. The customer service has gone down because all the unhappy full timers and the part time employees making mistakes,not working, taking a million breaks, coming in hungover or just calling out when they only work three days a week anyway. Lowe‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt fire anyone for attendance or poor work ethic. Don‚Äôt work here unless you are a part time employee that doesn‚Äôt actually like to work and you only like to collect the paychecks :)"
bad,Yelled at by coworker... very LIMITED training... Manager didn't care about much! They didn't call me when we didn't have to work Christmas night! Last minute was told we had to work thanksgiving and didn't receive holiday pay!
bad,Worst company in the world...Fired after taking a vacation and I was 8 months pregnant ! This company need to shut down or something..Just horrible ! Worst company ever!
bad,Management is a joke. They have no clue how to do their job. They do not communicate with each other or their employees. Lowe's does not care about its employees. They only care about making money.
bad,"Unfortunately management makes it impossible to advance. They tend to favour individuals in their 40‚Äôs + with less education, a family and a mortgage. They are worried that young and ambitious people with a strong educational background will leave for better opportunities, so they try to avoid promoting them as much as possible. They will be overlooked for full-time work too. For young adults, there is a solid glass ceiling."
bad,"The new CEO made sure to restructure the company and get rid of a few job descriptions throughout the company. If any of the other stores are like mine, they have a dozen do-nothings. Fire the slackers and keep the good working people."
bad,"I have been a successful Project Specialist of Interiors for Lowes in Midwest City Oklahoma for the past 3 years. This was a fairly high profile career within the Lowes Company which offered a base salary plus commission. I was hired on my past experience as a regional sales executive for several companies for Texas and the five surrounding states. I was offered the same position in Jacksonville Florida as a Project Specialist of Interiors for Lowes at an increase in pay. Accepting their offer, I was to report to them ready for work by November 19, 2018. I flew to Jacksonville and leased a house and relocated at my own expense. "
bad,"The only good thing about the Lowe's that I worked at was they gave me more hours even though I was part-time.Themost horrible thing is that they pay by how much experience you have in customer service. That system is absolutely terrible for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience in customer service and is just starting out in the workforce. I respectfully disagree with this method of paying people. The management was also extremely disorganized, which made tasks and/or helping customers really chaotic. The managers are rarely seen around the department when you need them and aren't very accommodating to the people working under them. I also would leave every day exhausted from all the extra work because the store and/or management is very disorganized."
bad,"If you like working 10 hour days with no overtime and working federal holidays without getting time and a half, then you‚Äôll love working for Lowes."
bad,"Poor usage of labor, too demending for the size of job and the pay. strict on you not getting even minutes of overtime while the work enviroment and job duties demand extra attention from everybody who works with customers."
bad,This company did a sweep of the top eight paid employees there and layed them all off on the same day. One employee had been there since the store opened for 15 years. Then fought her for unemployments for over two years. I did not like the way they treated the emeployees or there customers
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is an awful place to work, with poor management skills and unnecessary competition. The managers put people against each other and create an awful work environment. They do not care about their employees and will do *anything* to make the customers happy, even if it is against company policy."
bad,"Get told what to do by people who do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING all day. The senior managers are lazy and useless. Corporate is cutting jobs instead of cutting people who deserve to be fired. If one little troll at my store sees two associates talking, even if it‚Äôs work related, she‚Äôll scream at you. She‚Äôs in a big rush to gab all day with her buddies. The installation coordinator and the former credit card associate never work at all. One of the commercial sales guys shops or naps at his desk all day. Don‚Äôt work hard and you‚Äôre golden apparently."
bad,Terrible place to work. Managers dont care about anyone but themselves and do nothing to help out the employees. I hate that I chose this place to work
bad,They allow employees to steal from here. I worked 8 out of 10 full weekends. When you complain about working weekends they put you the 2-11 shift. You get no training at all from your manager.
bad,"I had over 20 years in my field, they still treated there friends better even when I worked there for 4 years longer.  The managers do what they want including stealing , drinking , ect. , Lowes policy says managers cant be involved with employees but upper management turns there back. It is very toxic and you must have thick skin or no respect for yourself.  Just A job until you get A job someplace better. The company only cares about the money and no one else not even customers. All they want is for employees to get people to spend more."
bad,Do not recommend. Extremely Poor management. Management doesn't require all associates in each department to meet all of the Lowe's job requirements. They do not follow policy and procedures.
bad,"How would you  like to work 10 hours a day all week and not be paid overtime???"
bad,"Hard, stressful work for low pay. Terrible management. To little work time. Not enough employees for department. Terrible chance of advancement from the receiving department."
bad,The management will target an employee and find reasons to get rid of them. The pay is low. The managers will not help when a cashier asks for help. The lower management is expected to make miracles happen
bad,"Of course you will stand all day.  Manager are under the pressures of district supervision on meeting goals and quotas.  Makes the environment hostile,  uneasy, and cut throat."
bad,Management does not approve of any position that is corporately mandated.  Took over two months to be hired for a position that the store management did not want on their payroll and treats the person hired in an appropriately poor manner at best.
bad,I did not like it it was boring and the people were not so nice they pay was good but the other things made it a bad place to work. Too much drama for the age the people are
bad,Was never really taught how to do the job. Had a lot of questions that went unanswered. Management was inconsistent and unprofessional. Seemed like no one really knew what their job was.
bad,It was really difficult to kove up in the company due to the fact that management didn't see eye to eye and would fight over employees. Never have I worked in such a harsh environment. I would get in trouble for doing what one manager told me to do because the other management didn't want me doing it. It made working there extremely difficult.
bad,Management isn't very good. Management was very rude and bad towards me and it seem like they were targeting me and only me at some points. What they did/do isnt far for me to other employees.
bad,Technology so out dated makes it difficult to learn system and help customers. Have to navigate through several screens to assist customers. Customer service was not number one priority
bad,Employees were treated as work horses by management who never gave any respect to the employees.  They never complimented an employee when a job was done above requirements.
bad,"The front end is run by a couple of lazy people. The commercial sales guys expect the cashiers to do all of the work and play secretary. Routinely one of them naps or goes off on company time to hang out. The schedule is done terribly, no coverage in departments to open or close. The middle of the day may only have three departments covered. Managers complain if they have to lift a finger. I‚Äôve never worked for managers who were so inept at their jobs."
bad,"The company does not value its employees. Everything is about the dollar and numbers. Take the time to value employee's opinions. Too much buddies hiring buddies going on! If you do not know anyone, you will not move up."
bad,Working at lowes I was very stressed about my working schedule and the way my managers handled things. Between passing aggressive customers to lower status employees to not deal with them and constantly blaming other employees of nothing gets done. Most employees there loved to gossip and managers would do nothing to stop it. The hardest part of the job was trying to defend myself against rumors that were spreading like wild fire.
bad,One of the worst companies I have worked for and regret giving them 4 years. Management and being promoted and/or moved around the company is based on favoritism and not hard working dedicated employees. I was constantly looked over by my supervisors and my multiple requests to move up in the company were ignored. They under pay their employees and sparingly give the option for overtime. Making living comfortably a stressful chore and paying bills and rent very difficult. I strongly recommend never working for this.
bad,Management would make you feel accountable for their mistakes and were inconsistent with how they wanted things done. Were also bullying their employees into doing things or working shifts or taking roles they did not wish to do. Would also bully employees into quitting if they did not like them
bad,"As part of the management staff, your schedule is like a yo-yo.  It has ups and downs.  You are expected to work at night and close the store after 10-12 hours and then expected to open the store the very next day.  You are famous for denying you your scheduled days off."
bad,"Don't work here,"
bad,clock in to start  got to your work station and look for a customer to help hardest part of job was keep every one happy the most enjoyable part was payday and leaving work work culture was cut throat and full of back stabbers
bad,"not a great place to work, doont care about you or your family. Care about their bottom line but will tell you that it is all about you and your family."
bad,"Too many uninformed Chiefs, not enough Indians.  Corporate leaders are extremely out of touch and the company provides little/no advancement opportunities. The company is presently removing all in store HR managers.  Need I say more?  "
bad,"Not allowed large amounts of overtime. Overworked for the pay. Not enough staff. Managers are hit and miss, get along best with the managers that don't run the front end (where I work). Policy changes from store to store; what was allowed at the store I transferred from is not allowed here."
bad,"The Lead retained a remnant of humanity but was harshly criticized and encouraged to abuse his staff.  The pay was ridiculous for the area but I took the job as an emergency measure.  The work was physically intensive and once management realized you were capable, you were drafted into doing things like unloading appliance trailers by hand and shoveling loading dock garbage in the rain.  I had to continually remind a sympathetic scheduler to modify my schedule to meet the constraints that were agreed upon at hire.  Everyone was subject to repeated and rude questioning if you had to go to the bathroom during your shift.  The bathroom was in a section of the store far from my area and there was no alternative.  Employees would walk off the job; some had been there for a few months, others for many years.  These are just a few of the working conditions available at Lowe's.  If none of this sounds absurd, Lowe's may be the place for you."
bad,Working for lowes is the worst mistake i have made in my life. Management is a joke. The managers dont know their departments. There is no training for someone hired into a department.
bad,don't care about employees and have to much favoritism cant get anywhere if your not buddy buddy with the management your hard work and knowledge has no standing
bad,"Home depot Managers that have been let go are being hired by Lowes.  They have no customer service skills and no interest in learning  our systems.  They are only interested in merchandising. "
bad,"Over Promise, Unprofessional management who don't know about their job. Store manager and assistant store managers have no clue of the departments technical details and do not understand specialists recommendation. They fire you if they don't like you. specialists work in fear environments. When store sales is down in a month, specialists get all the blames and under attacked by management."
bad,"would never work for lowes ever again, keep cuttimg hours, get less that 10 a week."
bad,"I had to leave due to the benefits were poor.I enjoyed the customers(some) and coworkers (some) but they expected so much from us , when someone calls in sick they do not call anyone in they just expect you to do the work of two or more people."
bad,not many hard working employees alot of lazy employees that want others to do their work for them pay is not enough and mangment is very unhelpful and rude
bad,"The customer service manager was intimidating and hard to talk to. The assistant cs manager got hired in at the same time as me but had the attitude that she was there for 10+ years and new it all, but had the mentality of a high schooler. All the employees talked bad about each other. The customers that go in there are generally rude but there are a few exceptions. Overall worse job I've had"
bad,"Management at Lowes doesn't get the long and complicated sales process of doors and windows. When I started at Lowes, we had 3 sales specialist, grew to 4 at one time,  ended up with 2 due to corporate budget cutbacks and loss of Department Managers, toss in a new ASM from Best Buy trying to prove her worth, knowing the only question to ask is ""would you like that Ipod in red or blue""  "
bad,Terrible go to home depot. No room to move up in Lowes. There stock is terrible compared to home depot. Managers get away with they want with no repercussions.
bad,"All of the high score reviews are either really old or written by a manager. The lower the score the more real it is. The stores only have two opening cashiers and maybe one sales associate until 10 am. The managers recently got told to be out of the offices and actually work 4 hours per day. The front end manager and his minion do as much nothing as humanly possible. Even worse, they make is difficult to do the job right.  4826 and 4804 manager phone carriers need to be fired and reasonably hard working people need to replace them."
bad,Management does not support the employees. They do not value their employees. Their pay scale is subpar. They are very demeaning.   Management does care how many hours the salaried employees work. It is never enough. The store manager once told me he expected me to work 90 hours a week because I was salaried.
bad,Stale management unwilling to change culture with advancing technologies. High School gossipy atmosphere with defined clicks. Good associates lost due to lack of advancement opportunities that were given to people who knew the right people instead of merit based.
bad,"poor supplies"
bad,"unqualified management team, with no repercussions for bad decisions or accountability."
bad,"Qualifications, move and walk, work for two people with pay for one. Abuse from customer, other associates and Management Work there only if you have no money, no food and live in a box."
bad,"in the face of Inventory season "
bad,"clock in, get vest from locker, check email for new work list, complete safety review for the day, complete down stocking list daily, weekly cycle counts, monthly pricing audits, assist customers, drive forklift, marrow aisle reach, and order picker to down stock or receive product, customer service, order products from DC, load customer cars, unload customer cars, face product, maintain clean and safe work environment daily. I learned how to provide exceptional customer service, how to handle money and maintain a cash register, process orders, how to drive the forklift, narrow aisle reach and order picker, how to work with different aged employees, complete pricing audits, and cycle counts, order from the DC. Management is lazy and they push everything onto the floor associates, they are unreliable and dishonest. Workplace culture there is friendly at first but then becomes very drama filled if you associate with a bunch of people. Hardest part of the job, dealing with lazy managers and employees, working hard and not getting any recognition for it, being slammed with work and not being able to complete work lists due to helping other employees/customers. Most enjoyable part, working with my family, actually making a difference in someones day, and helping them with a project, loading up elderly customers when they are unable to do so, lending a helping hand when someone is in need of it and no one else is around, or willing to help, completing tasks that are laid out before me every day and doing the tasks well."
bad,Management doesn't have your back customers come first even if they are wrong or rude. Never enough help on weekends. Staff isn't trained just given enough training to fill a position. Information and changes are not given out if employee is off. No communication at all unless big boss are coming in. Benefits for part time is horrible. They don't cover what they are suppose to cost more to use it than just paying it out of pocket.
bad,"-poor management"
bad,"The company has change so much that it's not for people over 40 anymore. They hire young people who don't want to work. Scheduling is terrible. We now have a new CEO that 's making changes, to better improve the company, with less people but more responsibility and less hours in doing your job, to be on the sales floor assisting customer's."
bad,"Lowe's so called management and associates avoid customers due to lack of knowledge, dishonesty and being lazy! Associates receive praise for little accomplishments or take credit for the work of another associate."
bad,"They will never give you a job in a Department that you have skills in ,just wherever they have a Opening. They always tell you ""We always have openings that you can apply for"" You want a job in  a Different Dept. you need to Apply just like Day 1 . They will write you up after a Manager shows favoritism to other employees who ""Suck Up"" .They  NEVER ask your side just write you up. Pay is POOR Cashiers only make about $10.00 hr. No Raise for the First Year you work there. I did not see a raise for 2 years than got .25 cent. They tell you that you are already at the Top of your pay scale and this is a Bonus for showing up to work.   New CEO maybe things will change but will take years. Watch out for ""Butt  Kissers"" because Management loves them and will make you do there job while they sit in a Manager's office Drinking Coffee for 2 hours."
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for a year without training, and nothing good came out working there other meeting great co-workers. My job as a FSA was to do my tasks on the sheets they printed out, but to the main  manager it more like she see something odd she call every hour to see if I do it, got it done yet or keeps call me for little thing that can be done on a slow days. I try my best to get my daily's done before 8am so I have the rest of the day to work on weekly and monthly,also help my co-workers when they are have troubles with their equipment not running right. I worked 4am till 1pm 11.16 an hour, but they wouldn't throw me a bone to keep motivate me to stay there."
bad,I never had a job I hated as much as I hated working at Lowe's boring slow mangers don't do their job well theirs A LOT of work place bullies and aren't held reasonable for the actions I think they need classes on how to treat their fellow co workers and customers
bad,The store was poorly staffed. Never enough coverage in departments. Managers were hard to reach and most times could be found sitting in the back. Would make it difficult for us at customer service
bad,The management has no backbone and will not stick up for their own employees. There is training what‚Äôs so ever and if they do it‚Äôs all computer training
bad,Lowe's doesn't care about their employees. It is all driven by corporate intereste. They say they are about family but it is yet to be proven. I would never recommend anyone working for Lowe's
bad,I worked for this company for 14 years and they don't care about their employees.They stripped every way of getting bonuses or commission.They are horribly under staffed
bad,The hours were terrible and inconsistent and that‚Äôs if you even get hours. The managers have no clue what they are doing and pick favorites. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,I wasnt happy at lowes just needed a job and that was the only one i could find they dont care about the people who work for them they just care about the bottom line!
bad,"Expected to do work outside of job description with little to no training in said work.  As a new worker, I was left alone to cover the entire customer service desk without help. When I complained that this was too much for one person to do alone, I was told to have a better attitude. As a new employee, I was required to answer phones, handle online orders, handle returns, and deal with customer complaints."
bad,do not work here.  management is terrible.  one tells you one thing and another something else.  you cannot do anything right and you get punished no matter what.
bad,The place had no moral and lies to their employees. For seasonal employees their was no advancement and they worked them to death. You had no life outside of work.
bad,"The pay was a mess , I was over worked. I stayed there for 3 years and could never get a full time position. They always hired outside people for fulltime positions and left me stuck training them. UNFAIR"
bad,Think twice it not a good place to work at management always had excuses never wanted to help if you can please look at other places there are other jobs good luck
bad,"While working for this company, I became so stressed out I was in the hospital multiple times, management does not help, management doesnt even know the departments. They barely let you go to the bathroom. They allow certain employees to get away with anything and make others do all the work."
bad,"Just stay away from this company-mgrs---are cut throat!!!  They dont back you up at all, its allways the workers fault too. Talk sweet to you face to face then stab you in the back"
bad,Been with the company 18 years.  It might as well be my 1st year.  They treat you everyday as if you are replaceable and no pay raise in 5 years because you are capped while insurance and cost of living keeps going up along with prices they charge the customers
bad,I did not  like working here due to POOR Management. They are under staffed and the employees are over worked and under appreciated. The training here is POOR as well.
bad,There is 2 good managers but the rest  will lie to you about moving you to another department and never do it. They will talk about you behind your back to other associates.
bad,"Dont work at lowes unless youre still in highschool needing something temporary. Front end is a nightmare to work, chronically understaffed. Training was not done by management but by other coworkers who 99% dont have the time to train. They hired only teens because no adult with sense will work here. Downside to hiring teens? They dont know about skilled trades because theyre young. I dont know how many times i had a customer screaming in my face because i didnt know about a certain product and couldnt find someone with knowledge. Management also doesnt help when situations like that arise. I worked delivery so i shouldnt have even had to deal with that. Theyll also hire you for a position that youll never actually work, we never left on time, if you have something thats not directly tied to sells then it doesnt matter to management."
bad,nothing to say about this job or this company. they start you off with good money and then when you get overtime they make you take a day off so you don't see it.
bad,"If you don't mind HR lying to you multiple times and managers lying to you then this is the place for you. If you work lumber get ready for the store manager to focus on things that are his pet peeves and not in line with the store's vision. He got aggravated with me on a few occasions because I was helping customers during IMPACT HOURS instead of helping him do whatever stupid thing he wanted done. "
bad,"I wouldn‚Äôt even recommend this place on my worst enemy, each manager doesn‚Äôt know how to follow policy and they kept cutting my hours. A guy came in with no experience and got paid more than me by over a dollar."
bad,"I was a loader part time, and it sucked. The pay isn‚Äôt worth the labor being outside in the hot sun loading cement and lumber. They never let you inside even during the winter they forced me to stand outside in the cold to wait for customers."
bad,"Management sucked the last year, no one is held accountable for any of their actions. Hard to leave on time most but not all employees show up 15 min past the scheduled shift."
bad,"Working at Lowes Home Improvement was possibly the worst working experience I've ever faced. From being forced to work 13+ hour days ALONE in the biggest department in the store to being dragged through the dirt at 2AM because of a singular piece of trash after I spent hours perfecting the department to the absolute best of my ability, I put up with the most ridiculous Tomfoolery I have ever had to deal with in the workplace."
bad,difficult work environment.  You were frequently pulled away from the job that you were hired for in order to fill the need within other understaffed areas of the company
bad,"CSA2 full time position"
bad,"Excited to become an employee for Lowes, however I was not expecting the unfairly prejudiced that was shown through out the entire time I worked at Lowes.  I felt like management was rude and unprofessional on a daily basis and made no time to get to know their employees.  I felt that the new employees worked harder than their permanent employees.  I did not feel appreciated nor did I feel accepted."
bad,was not a good place to work no one cared about anything that happend there. and also the management was super bad i wont not recommend that place for anyone to work there
bad,Employees are treated like children. Managers do not hold themselves accountable for mistakes of their own making. Company is constantly giving more work to already under paid employees without proper compensation.
bad,Managers are not in the business of cultivating long term employees.  Resistant to ideas unless they were their own. I had managers that were afraid to step out due to pressure concerns from regional managers.
bad,you are not allowed to leave your area to show people what they were looking for the rules were unreasonable. not enough pay. they want workers to stop thieves and know that they stole something or you are fired.
bad,"Where do I begin...this company doesn't care about its employees and they actually don't care about the customers either. They just want the customers to spend their thousands and thousands of dollars there. Managers will allow customers to berate you. Managers always want to delegate tasks instead of helping with the workload. ALWAYS understaffed which results in upset customers because there's no one in the department to help them, which results in them ranting to the first red vest they see. Lots of cliques and gossip among adults. I could go on, but overall very poor company to work for. Senior management in their ivory towers pass down absurd rules and regulations that they don't have to heed to, nor do they realize the effect they have on the store level employees. Want you to gave open availability all the time 24/7/365. Part time employees get shiiieeettt benefits. Only two paid holidays per year."
bad,The environment at Lowe's is very negative.  Pay is not equal to work.  There are benefits but they are quite bad.  Employees are treated as if they are disposable.
bad,"The Grand Junction store abuses seasonal law by continually hiring staff as ""seasonal"" and then eliminating any hours before the 6 month. They hire approximately every 4 months here for the same position and just rotate the staff out before 6 months are up. This allows them to not offer any benefits, vacation or sick time."
bad,"Managers are clueless to anything and don‚Äôt speak one on one with associates. You get a .10 cent raise once a year, even if you lift concrete all day or do nothing it‚Äôs all equal pay. A manager has not asked me about my job or how I‚Äôm doing since I‚Äôve started."
bad,"Learned plenty of work ethics at this job, what to expect when problems arise and how to handle them quickly, I love the people that I have encountered."
bad,"not a good place when you reach higher salary levels you become targeted. Unless your a cool-aid drinker don,t expect to with them long term. They continue to reinvent the ""insanity"" wheel ,, you know doing the same things over and over that didn't work at other companies and expecting different results. they don't have a personality as a company"
bad,"You are held responsible for your actions, but the supervisors are difficult to work with. You do not feel like you are wanted there, The customers are very nice and appreciative."
bad,"As  bland of a work environment as you can imagine, and unstable. Staff was slashed by 35% when they decided the store was not performing well enough. Management was also forced to re apply to keep their jobs, and only a few were kept on."
bad,"Lowe's management does not respect its employees, and does not promote from within the company. They actively hire from outside of the company and do not hide that fact."
bad,Management is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. You will strart at minimum wage and will have to beg for a raise. You will be continually asked to do more with no reward. Advancement is difficult. Do yourself a favor go work for Walmart.
bad,Out of touch management with poor people & customer service skills. Management out of touch with newly acquired computer programs that operate the daily business. The scheduling of delivery that was not oversaw at all resulting in overtime for the driver's of delivery truck & the written reprimands of department manager for the accrued overtime.
bad,I enjoyed working at lowe's because the job was easy to me and I made it my point to memorize where things belonged in the store in order to do my job effectively.
bad,"the management treats their employees like trash and in turn the employees treated the customers like trash.  No advancement opportunities, forced to work in other departments with no training."
bad,The company only cares about making money and not at all about its employees.  The management team was ineffective and wouldn't look into any employee issues.  They made me work 70 hour work weeks with no overtime.
bad,Everyone was messy and fighting over hours the head cashier was messy they cut down your ours if they didn‚Äôt like you. They was rude the workers was rude manager was very rude it was inconsistent hours!! They would change the schedule with short notices it was an horrible experience!
bad,"I held many jobs at Lowes over the seven years I worked there. Days would start at 6am, with receiving shipments, unloading merchandise and stocking shelves. I work in delivery where I would pull orders with various forklifts, load the delivery trucks and assist with merchandise to customers homes. The work environment could be stressful at times with deadlines, damaged merchandise, and unsatisfied customers. Extending patience and attention to detail always helps in these difficult situations. Excellent long lasting friendships were made while working at Lowes."
bad,"Very hard, dirty work, with very little appreciation from the managers, and very little compensation for what you do. Very little communication btwn the managers, and very little communication from the managers to the employees, as a result. There were never enough employees working in each dept, and a lot of times had the only help you had, for the day, pulled to cover another dept."
bad,"Poorly managed store and team. Unfair favoritism promotions. Not a good place to work!!! Great fellow employees to work with until the favoritism is shown from management, its hard to be friends once they get involved!"
bad,"company does not stand behind there employees, they lie to get there own way in unemployment dispute, I was injured on the job and even though I had prof of what had happened in unemployment and had a operation on down in time I was refused and the injury occurred ad lowes"
bad,"for starters, they don't train anyone and they only help themselves. they will fire people on there day off without remorse. they treat their customers terrible plus the managers don't care there racist, misogynistic and lazy."
bad,"It is retail. I am getting older and I did not enjoy it. Shift work is hard, no advancement for me, Did not enjoy doing it.  Long hours, weekends and holidays."
bad,Not well staff to get the job done so extra work falls on people there for making it a safety concern for the employees. Managers do not train people and they train people selectively instead of consistently
bad,"Poor staffing leads to constant changing hours and roles. Employees will be required to fulfill roles that they weren't hired for with no training or the benefit of the pay difference. If you want to work at place where they throw inexperienced people into positions at the expense of employees and customers, this is the job for you. "
bad,The restructure at Lowes made it a very difficult place to work. The mt pocono location is very hard to hire for.  You cannot find good quality candidates
bad,"Company so big they don't care about you as an individual. I don't like that everyone is part-time except managers, Although the pay is good.  I don't recommend this for single parents."
bad,The bosses play favorites I never got a fair shot for jobs that I was qualified for the bosses would give the jobs to there buddies Lowe's sucks to work for although the pay and benefits were hood
bad,Lowes says they are all about family but this isn't true. They have policies in place but choose to not follow them.  They are only in it for thier bonuses they do not care about employees. Maybe new CEO will change this.
bad,"Lowe's is a poorly managed, understaffed place to work.  This place has almost no advancement opportunities unless you're willing to completely break your back for little wages.  They'll have you do a $20 job for $7 less, and complain when you don't do what they want you to do in the time slotted because they give you the work of three people and don't give you any help.  They say be a team player but don't provide you with a team to work with."
bad,"I reviewed Lowe's of Sarnia quite a while ago and see it wasn't posted, Guess they don't want the truth to be out there . If you want to work for a store that management cares less about you and you are treated poorly than by all means apply. I worked there for a grueling 2 years and hated every second of it. Every thursday corporate would come down and walk people.Worse place I ever worked at."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs does not stand by its values"
bad,Typical retail. Overworked management under worked staff. Too much time spent managing hours and not the customer environment and you could tell in the behaviors  of the employees
bad,The job is absolutely unprofessional and the management is horrible! They work you like robots and do not care how the store looks until corporate comes in. The workers are rude as well.
bad,Bad manger give you break whenever they feel like you lucky to get a break even a 10‚Äômin over all bad company worst manager ever I can‚Äôt believe it all
bad,"This was a place that was a means to an end and I'm glad for that. There isn't room for advancement, the pay is low and the management doesn't ever seem to know what each other are doing. Very hard place to get stability in and they demand all of your time by saying verbatim ""we don't even consider an employee unless they give us full open availability."""
bad,"I was in school stayed out of town, they'd make me work and extra hour after close knowing I'd have to make an hour length drive, worked me in my department alone and also had to lift 50 lbs plus (of multiple items)  almost ever night .  I don't recommend you apply for a department position unless your applying for cashier."
bad,If you are trying to support a family don't even apply. The pay is peanuts and the way you are treated and talked to by certain managers is infuriating!
bad,Racist and rude power tripping managers with no respect and will insult you if you do anything wrong. always on their phones and just sit around lazily making lower employees do their work for then. leave early and take super long breaks while you barely get break time. managers always test your patience and are always just so catty and petty.
bad,I loved my job and the people I worked with for years. But they eventually jumped on board with the greed. and fired over half there long term workers. any full time jobs were cut.
bad,"cons:"
bad,"Strict rules, terrible hours. I was promised 30 hours a week I barely got 20 not to mention there was a shortage in our department. They don't train you very well and you were better off trying to learn the stuff yourself. Though don't expect to ever see your manager because that won't happen and if you do they're too busy to deal with you. None of my managers really knew what they were doing and the whole time I worked there I was very confused about what was going on and what I was suppose to be doing. People are nice and customers are nice at least in the area I was in. Pay was okay but I never got any hours and in the month that I worked there I was scheduled off for 2 entire weeks and even talked to my manager about it and it wasn't fixed so I jumped ship as quick as possible so I didn't fall behind on my bills."
bad,This 'White Settlement' store was very poorly run by arrogant and ignorant management.  On a typical day there was always understaffing and as a result there were ridiculous expectations of employees to cover more areas of the store and the assigning of a higher workload than could have been accomplished.
bad,The Oakland Park store was not running correctly by management. In will just let you see for yourself. Some of the people I worked with are truly some team players and that's how is should be there is no I in TEAM
bad,"When i first started there, i was getting about 30 hours a week. In the summer time they hired many seasonal cashiers and cut everyones hours to 10 a week."
bad,"The regional management were in for a visit this week. The store had been cleaned ( for once), the schedule was actually full of people and none of the managers were hiding in their offices. The reality is the managers are never out and about, the store is always a huge mess and there‚Äôs very few workers every day. The only time there are anywhere near enough coverage is on a day when an inspection is due! If the corporation sent surprise inspections they might see how the stores really get run. Dirty, peaved customers and no staff to help them."
bad,Working at Lowes was horrible for me. I didn't expect it to be such a bad experience for me. I was hoping to be able to make a decent salary as a single mother but it was such the opposite.
bad,Not a good place to work. Developed anxiety.  Managers were disrespectful and inappropriate. They worked u like a dog then not give u a raise. Too much drama and unhealthy competition.
bad,"Had to be there at 5am to water the plants and flowers both inside and outside. also to wait on customers helping them to find plant food, or any outside items they needed."
bad,"This place it terrible, promises to give you full time after you bust your butt doing hard work and labor for them and they only care about themselves and the bonuses they get for not letting any workers get overtime."
bad,"It was ok when I worked there, but there were management issues. I met alot of really great people that I still call friends, but if you like everything done by the corporate book, dont work here"
bad,"Some of the co workers are great. The managers are all a joke, all they do is hide. The rare time they ever show their face is to tell you to do a better job. They don't give you any real feed back or training to do better. Even if you bust your hump and even kiss alot of butt it's near impossible to get promoted."
bad,"The management doesn't know what they are doing. The company doesn't offer any benefits, they over work their employees in the 4-5 hours they are on the clock."
bad,"lack of training employees, lack of leadership, no job security. several employees are not dependable. deliveries do not go out when scheduled, a lot of favoritism"
bad,"if salaried you are expected to work whenever they think you should, I have not learned anything useful with this job unless patients counts, if anything I have taught more than I have learned, management is terrible especially the store manager. The company is an entire sham that overworks its employees and gives little to no benefits to those that work the most to keep the stores running while managers and those higher up the food chain continue to have multiple weeks vacation and yearly incentives based on the work of specialist"
bad,"It is a thankless place to work for little money and lots of abuse, little support from corporate. Corporate as well as share holders have become more interested in making money than keeping loyal employees. It had become increasingly more stressful and distressing to work there."
bad,I was hired  and terminated in a 3 month time frame. All I was told was I wasn't following policy and procedure. I was never written up or given any verbal warnings. Store manager directed me to go to Regional HR to find out specifics. They wouldn't call me back. Tried for over two weeks to talk with someone. The week before my termination another employee with the same title was termed for not following policy and procedures; no warnings or write ups either... I didn't deserve this kind of treatment. I filed multiple complaints with the companies ethics line and all were closed with no explanation from Lowes... This company is up too no good....
bad,"The summary says it all. Lowe's is in bad financial straits and its beginning to show in the stores. Last year they did a store level management restructuring, firing half of their assistant store managers and all of their department managers which eliminated direct supervision at the departmental level, replacing them with a handful of floating floor managers, all in addition to cutting customer service staff by not replacing when employees leave. Long story short, you will be expected to do the work of two people for lousy pay and part time hours in an environment where anyone could be let go at any time to try and cut costs for corporate."
bad,"The manager was a tyrant, and fired people for the silliest reasons. There was a high turnover, and morale was very low. No one gets any training; but expected to perform to perfection"
bad,"If you're an older employee (50+) you'll be the first to be let go.  Culture is geared toward younger employees.  Don't speak up for yourself, allow them to walk all over you or they'll let you go."
bad,"I love working with people, I also made sure that everything was in order before closing the store. made sure that all my cashiers got to go to their lunches and breaks on time"
bad,They pressure you to make the count for the day . They fired me because i didn't make the count but they would give me really heavy boxes knowing well I'm so little and cant carry box thats 100 pounds
bad,"hostile work environment. Severely understaffed. rude unappreciative management.  1 Inconsistent scheduling. Often not enough time off between shifts, less than 12 hours,  Often changes schedule at the last minute but not notify employee. Has a rotating schedule which makes it difficult to make plans in advance.  1 weekend off per month,"
bad,Managers know nothing about the store. They know nothing about how to be helpful in a department or on a register. The computer training is set up by people who don‚Äôt have a clue how it all works. The online system is a horrible mess. The managers DO NOT HELP!
bad,Have a preshift meeting they would give us tags and we would go threw out that building and get the product and take it to the bay doors to be shipped out to the stores
bad,Lowe's is filled with people who are done with trying.  The majority of the people that work at Lowe's are people who secure themselves a job with Lowe's and stop trying with anything else.  They get paid just enough to scrape by and that's good enough for them.
bad,Company policies are not followed which makes it difficult to understand your position and perform your duties in a professional manner. Management do not back employees while explaining return policy in front of customers.
bad,Managers walk by a line of customers and ignore it. People who actually work are threatened and reprimanded everyday. Those that constantly call out or do nothing all day are the favorites. The schedule looks full until you see the names of people that left months ago. The only reason tho work there is pay and benefits are pretty good for retail.
bad,"Management shows favoritism and hires people without thoroughly checking into whether or not they can properly handle the job. For example, it is great they they hire older people (over 60 years of age), but should not put them in a delivery driver position where appliances and/or tile orders are delivered. "
bad,worst place ive ever worked at. management does not care about you and will not advance you or help you with concerns. ignores you. i was bullied by supervisors. bad job. doesnt pay enough
bad,i worked at lowes for a year which i highly regret because of the position i worked there. i worked in the receiving part of lowes where the managers never paid any attention to what you were doing so they didnt care if you asked for help. the management is just terrible. They didnt hire anybody when we needed people and it was just because they didn't care.
bad,"worst place ive ever worked at, worst management, never got any raise, after 2 years of working there and getting my forklift license i never got a raise. co workers were taking days off once every other week for vacations and i was working the same amount of hours as him and never got any paid vacation days, worst management of all time, i could of been in the back pretending to sweep the floor and they wouldnt of know what i was doing. the only good thing about this place was the paid 15 minute breaks i got daily working 12 hours. this place is a dump"
bad,"They try to get you to quit when you start getting close to your five years (where you earn extra benefits and a raise).  If you don't quit they build a case against you to try and get you fired.  You will have to quit before they can fire you because they are also very versed in fighting unemployment claims.  Rules are constantly changing and they don't tell you about the changes until they are writing you up for ""breaking the rules"".  Management lies about helping you with anything, and always says ""We're too busy to help you now but we will let you know when something can be done"" then nothing is ever mentioned about it ever again.  Managers coach just for the sake of coaching, and get upset with you when you point out that they are telling you to do something differently than what the previously said.  They ask for your feedback on certain things, then lecture you as if you're the problem.  They ask how they can help, only so they can make up excuses as to why nothing will ever be done about anything.  Most frequent feedback about being on the phones from management is ""Just don't do/say that on the phone.""  And if you ask what you can say in those situations, you will always get ""not that, just not that."" And no matter what you do or say, they will be over your shoulder coaching you on it until you feel there is nothing you can do correctly, which only contributes to the case they are most likely building against you."
bad,"Too many changes,  they will change something 6 months later go back. Cutting jobs then making new ones the. You apply but they bring back people the cut??? "
bad,The only advice you can get is the directions to Home Depot any money you think you will save by going to lowe's you will lose in lost time because they are so unless
bad,"Do not go here if you have a work ethic. "
bad,The management at Lowe's didn't care about employee moral at all.  Only thing they cared about was cutting hours so that they could meet their numbers.
bad,"A typical day at Lowes is showing up, and being short-staffed.  Having to do not only your job but the job of neighboring departments due to poor scheduling or no shows.  Lowes Management does not support their employees.  It is a high stress job no matter what level.  I learned NOTHING as a manager.  There was essentially no training and no motivation for upper management to help you succeed in your role within the company.  This company robbed me of all joy and time with my family.  I was constantly stressed and overwhelmed and had no help from management or co-workers.  I would not recommend Lowes (after 5+ years of employment) to anyone wanting to keep their sanity."
bad,"Long days, horrible management, no consistency, they say they put safety first but don't practice what they preach, horrible training they throw you to the wolves, too many high school type clicks going on with bosses and management, unprofessional, constantly changing rules and not informing employees about them, constantly cutting costs and firing employees that have been there for many years, bad turn over rate, find a better place to work for and save yourself the aggregation! Management doesn't care about their employees you're only a number. Always in mandatory overtime, never enough workers according to them."
bad,"It all depends on your perspective of what you want to see from Lowes. Personally they have some stores that made there employees feel welcomed, but at this location they kinda make you feel like you do not want to even be there."
bad,"Management was very poor, they had no training and didn't know how to treat the employees. There was a lot of favoritism and unfairness. Not a friendly place to work."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. As a sales specialist you would assume my job is to sell, yet daily I am tasked so heavily doing small tasks that we used to have department managers to do, I do not even have the time to do my own job now."
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had- management was not kind or helpful in any capacity, the store felt sterile and lifeless, the employees were all bored and hated their jobs.The location i worked at closed down so this could be an isolated experience."
bad,when working for this company you will have only  part time choice. The company will work employees really hard but will not offer pay to match the amount of work done. Plus this company made a change where they do not offer Full time
bad,"Altogether, I worked for the same Lowe's store for five years in two different departments. I actually enjoyed my position, but was pushed to leave due to the hostile environment. All managers are horrible at communication and threats of getting written up for not making them look good. The schedule in my lead position was supposedly fixed, but the day of a schedule change, they would tell us we were expected to do an overnight. The store manager didn't act on employee complaints about department managers after getting several statements from employees being treated poorly."
bad,working in the store was a nightmare some of the staff was nice to begin with and the others are rude.  department manager was a nasty lady.  talked about everyone behind their back and would be nice to there face.  store manager didnt do anything because they were buddys.
bad,"The store is ran by a bunch of people who only care about themselves and SALES. Managers don't care about you or your personal life. The pay is horrible unless you are a manager, I would never recommend working here."
bad,The managers have favorites. The customers are rude and inconsiderate. Lowes breaks laws regarding lunch breaks. Really don‚Äôt go there. Let them flounder.
bad,"Very poor management, training, support, etc.  I would not go back to work there.  Every employee I talked with complained about the job, management support (or the lack of)."
bad,I was a single parent and my son was in school the school nurse would call me to pick him up when he had pnemonia or bronchitis i had to leave early to take him home. My manger layed me off during the slow season of March. for the couple of days i had to take my son home. Even though i never called out or took a vacation day off.
bad,"At first lived where I worked then, they go through managers and human resource and employees like crazy. If you know what your doing they get rid of you. If your just there they keep you because it's cheaper."
bad,bad place to work its hard to get help no training on the floor if you need someone to get something down with forklift good luck no manment help bad place
bad,"Managers can not ever be bothered to do anything. They are just so busy hiding or online shopping to get out of the office. The people with seniority wander doing nothing all day. Finding anybody to do anything is stupidly hard. The install sales guy is blatantly lazy, the commercial sales people won‚Äôt help a customer in front of them. There‚Äôs a few who nap at their work station."
bad,"get ready to suck up to management to move up and get better pay. Will not give you full time, only full time hours so they won't have to give you insurance or any benefits."
bad,I applied for the cdl position at lowes been there 2 months never drove the cdl truck. They tell you you will occasionally have to haul appliances because they have non-cdl driver but its more you will do that daily. absolutely no leadership or management. Also they tell you your hours are 7-4 but its 7 till whenever you are done (been there as late as 8pm) If you try to address any issues they just act like you should have known and the say if you are unhappy you should leave.Huge disappointment and the only perk is 10% off which is a joke because amazon beats most of their prices and since i work in delivery i can say you are better off having amazon deliver. Plus you can't even use your lowes credit card 5% ontop of the 10%.
bad,Would never reference cookeville Lowe‚Äôs to anyone. Co workers are not cooperative. Some associates treat others poorly. Very few people in management would help in a situation.
bad,ok place to work for but really glad I left management is not good in stores any more. they let associates run the store and the store managers are never around they sit in there office all day.
bad,everything is slow paced the management will not help at all. they expect you to always be working even though their aren't any customers at the store or even if the morning shift associates finished everything.
bad,See above. They don‚Äôt invest in their teams; they cut positions and treated their employees unfairly. There wasn‚Äôt much room for advancement unless you played the corporate game. If you had any experience other than lowes and offered it as a way to help the store develop you were black listed.
bad,"Poor management structure is the main issue, which leads to a high employee turnover rate and overall dissatisfied/unqualified workers.   As a result of this, the customer service provided at this store is very subpar.  There are not enough qualified workers and no one cares about their job, or the customer, as is shown through the very minimal training that new employees receive.  Management is extremely weak and ineffective and I believe that it is a structural issue, not a personal work ethic issue with the managers themselves."
bad,I would not work here unless you want to spend all of your time here and never get recognized for your hard work. I was very troubled by the fact that they could not work with me because i was a student and expected me to choose loses over school
bad,When first started working at Lowe's they were great to work for and then the management style changed and they forced full weekend availablity and didn't look at the individual circumstances.  lowe's looked at each person as a number and lost the ability to care.
bad,"I'm a student, and needed a part time job. Came into Lowe's when they were doing open interviews. When I spoke with one of the managers about my hours, I told him that I couldn't work weekends because that's when I do my homework. I work in the morning, and go to school in the afternoon. He said that if I didn't work weekends, I wouldn't be hired. I needed a job, so I had to take it. He basically black mailed me because he knew I needed employment. "
bad,They do not believe in family and are not flexible to your family needs. If you have kids don‚Äôt apply there. They are unorganized and don‚Äôt care for their people.
bad,"While lowe's advertises as a safe and fair place to work their management ethics speak volumes against that. I do not recommend working there at all if you value your sanity, dignity and self respect."
bad,I was the set up my for the deliveries. The hardest part was getting up 4am to go to work. I made sure the products were not damaged and delivered them to the customer. The work culture was alright but could improve.
bad,"This place is a joke and i do not recommend working here. your lucky if you get benefits. Management is so bad. They bully people, especially hr and managemnt."
bad,"constant restructuring put lots out of jobs.  extreme hours, poor work life balance, hard stressful work with high demands, low level of resources to get work done, low pay, difficult to move up"
bad,Dont work here they don't keep you Mangers are rude  and don't care  about you bonus are for them and not the employees  no holiday bonuses full time is only 39 hours at this store  to much drama in the store
bad,"Upper management seems to only care about there pay and bonuses ,they find reasons for you to fail at your job ,been with the company 12 years everyday you worry if you have a job if your not kissing upper managements butt bonuses  suck and pay increase is degrading to all the associates to tend to all the work where ASM and service mangers  do nothing  when you go in there wear a suit of armor you never know when knives will be thrown at you get rid of front end asm. Things might get better go by her word your not in the click  people work to hard in there to the little bonuses where upper management get more money for doing nothing I don't advise working at this  Lowes not till the ASM front end is gone"
bad,"Don't even think about working at Lowe's, Management has their "
bad,"If this company sold caskets they would tell you to ""create more customers"". All they care about is sales. They want you to sell the most expensive products to people who dont even need them. They change your hours every week and need a completely open availability. This makes it difficult to pursue hobbies or an education or even a second job. It is okay for a seasonal position if you are looking for something temporary however I would not consider this viable employment full time. Terrible company terrible culture. All they care about is sales and no commission."
bad,"Would only recommend this job to young people who are just getting started in the work field. Preferably still in school and don't mind major hour cuts (12-20 hours weekly). You can definitely gain much needed experience (per department) to your resume which is always a plus. If you are looking for job security, decent pay, good benefits, and career advancement....then your looking in the wrong place. Lowes could care less about your financial situation or, you as a person. Trust and believe If you aren't in the right click or if you aren't the right color, you will go nowhere. You will only be stuck at a standstill in both your life as well as career. If you are part-time (which more than likely you will be), you are basically a peon and your voice nor feelings will not/do not matter. My outlook or opinion/overview on management....well lets just say I'll be civilized and keep my comments to thy self!"
bad,"My work experience in two previous stores was good. Positive management. Team work encouraged and positive verbal and written rewards. In my last store, a typical day at work was stressful. Department understaffed. The culture was take it or leave it.. Managers managed the store bottom line and had little or no interest in employee interaction."
bad,The store has a rat and bird infestation. The store has a problem with ordering product so we would be out of product for weeks at a time. The customer service desk doesn't answer the phone majority of the time.
bad,company is trying to cut headcount by reducing hours and employee pay.  Likes to hire seasonal so they don't have to pay benefits.  Managers more interested in bonus than employees
bad,Management does not actually care about their employees. Working conditions were less than favorable. Worked you til you dropped. Would never work there again.
bad,"Worked there for over 2 yrs, started off as head of new interiors program that they did not know how to manage or control. Was in interior design and remodeling for years with different company and never had the problems that arose from working at Lowe's. I saw employees, including myself, trying to advance and complete all training necessary only to be denied any opportunity for advancement. Actually saw on a managers desk, when in speaking for him, a list of people headlined ""favorites"".... noticeably these were the only people who were promoted or allowed to move positions- even though I had seen many others working their tails off and giving all they had only to be ignored and more expected of them with no gratitude from any management. I finally left after working hard for two years only to be treated terribly and used. Management is quick to pretend they care about staff but never change a thing and always be there to criticize, but never praise."
bad,"Management only cares about itself and who can kiss up the best. They literally gave a management position to someone who was in a back in damaged item clerk who was handed the position with a small amount of pending items and within 3 months had let it get to 5 times that amount. They under pay and over work their deliveries crew until and set everyone up for failure while they find their subordinate managers to deal with problems that they deem ""not their job"". They hired me as a load puller for the flatbed but got short handed and forced me to do the appliance deliveries full time saying its in my job description.. (it only states to assist on deliveries as needed)."
bad,"This company claims to be the place that can make you ‚ÄúLove where you work‚Äù. However, they only advance and promote the employees that sit in the managers office for 3/4 of their scheduled shift."
bad,"Safety and theft prevention are the fault of the employees even if there aren‚Äôt enough people to work the store. No where near enough Department coverage! Good luck taking vacation or even a day off. The schedule is brutal, a shuffle of before dawn, afternoon and late night shifts. Managers are ZERO help, they‚Äôre only there to yell at you and disappear for hours. The store is short people every day. There needs to be a minimum of 30 per day. This store runs on 20 on a good day."
bad,If in a sales role they take back your commission if customers return jobs due to extended install times. No instlllers. Program not ready for market. No managers have background in what the program offers.
bad,"I would caution anyone applying for a position at this company. They have had a lot of changes, in particular the role of managers. There are fewer and they are typically unresponsive. The general manager is especially out of touch with his employees. The workload expectations are unrealistic, so most people try to hide so as not to get it dumped all on them. Retail is changing rapidly with online consumerism, and Lowe's could have the potential to stay afloat since many customers need hands on explanation and attention. However, they are not invested in truly training their employees to adequately answer customers' questions."
bad,"There's no way that I would work for a place that is willing to destroy families by laying off managers with decades of experience.,,................."
bad,Sucked because Lowes is failing and only cares about higher up management. Was always pushed to accomplish task set by store management so they would be rewarded with bonuses that never actually affected my pay.
bad,I wouldnt reccoment a career at Lowes. There is no way to live above a poverty level unless in an upper management position or in sales or CDL driver delivery or installation
bad,When i was hired at Lowe's my first 6 months it was good.They changed the system for the better of the company which was not working employees was walking off the job mangers was lying to save them selves it turned into a very bad place to work.it was every man for them selves. not good!
bad,"Management is for the under-qualified brown-nosers with selfish agendas that gossip just as bad as the cashiers. The general attitude is ""that's not my job"" so the customers are usually dissatisfied. The bosses put a lot on the shoulders of those at the bottom without providing the support, time or tools necessary to adequately fulfill your responsibilities. Yet nobody can figure out why the customer ratings are so bad. Ha!"
bad,"Do not work for this company,they will send you out with a full truck of fridges that you don't know how to take apart because they are short handed,I worked for the Lennox location in Jacksonville FL,do not work for this location"
bad,High turn over rate... Why? First off pat is really low I was making 11.96 an hour unloading containers by hand and then stocking merch over night by the end of a two week period I would take home under $100 because of high benefits cost and taxes... Mangement expects you too work hard and complete the amount of work it would take 2 people to do. Most people who stay are either really young and naive or older and have less options to get a better job. Not recommended if you have a family or goals to succeed in life. Don‚Äôt believe the hype that‚Äôs why they are always hiring and never have enough workers.
bad,Terrible place to work. Always stay late and come in early. Management is the worst I've ever seen. Managers are childish and not logical at all. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,The typical day there would make me want to quit. The staff at the Amherst NY location was extremely rude and made me want to quit and no one in HR took my complaints seriously.
bad,"When working overnight you arent allowed to leave the building, so nine hours of being locked inside. The management at my store was poor, headed by someone who was unable to take constructive criticism and refused to admit if he was wrong or an idea was counter productive. Very little communication between management, which meant that they gave associates a bunch of different conflicting orders. Everything that went wrong was blamed on the night crew, which ultimately ended in us having to do the work of most of the day crew along with our own. Poor accountability"
bad,"cashier, cash handling, theft control (can't confront or touch criminals), limited breaks, drama, won't offer full time, greedy company, higher more people to keep from increasing full time positions, no over time pay"
bad,It‚Äôs just very stressful people constantly call in talking to you like your an idiot and don‚Äôt know your job the customers are very disrespectful and there is nothing we can do about it
bad,"The management continues to add more tasks not part of normal guidlines. They will be satisfied with your work for a while, but as your workload increases, they will demand more and more until micro management and time limits work you into a corner. If you have sales experience you will probably do fine."
bad,"Manager with no real management ability, only could do what the daily directives told him to do. Was told one thing by HR when I was hired and after she was let go what she told me didn't exist anymore."
bad,"You‚Äôre not allowed to be honest with customers when they are WRONG or just being RUDE. Swearing and threatening behavior by customers is encouraged by managers. Managers want you to do their job and yours. Never transfer a call or ask a manager to help. They are too busy hiding from work, gossiping or playing games on their phones."
bad,"The recent reviews all are pretty accurate and not anything new to me. Years ago when the stores had staff and a management team that worked it was good. Now that the managers hide from working, there‚Äôs no one working departments almost all day, it‚Äôs terrible. Customers leave angry they can‚Äôt get any help. Walk into a Home Depot and there are people working and customers can get help."
bad,"You will learn and gain experience in this Job, But I would recommend it as a temporary job to find what you are looking for to advance in your career."
bad,Stressful overworked help leads to high turnover  expect to much and micro manage no development from upper managment would not recomend this as a workplace
bad,"Every day is the same. Work hard, get yelled at by angry under appreciated customers. There is not enough staff on any day of the week. The computers are garbage. Most of the senior managers are lazy useless blame appointing dictators. The newest ones work really hard and are pleasant people. Today there wasn‚Äôt anybody in garden, millwork, hardware , tools and lumber for half of the day."
bad,"I had 12 different start to work times, and rotating days off and after 6 months of this I couldn't take it anymore. Training in my job duty was very poor."
bad,"2407 is an stressed out pit of misery. Every day the staff is overworked due to understaffing. Managers hide in the office all day. They come out for maybe 20 minutes per day. The workers get a hard time if they ask for manager help. Being an upper manager means that you get to sit and play games on your phone or online shop, not work."
bad,Managers are lazy. Slow to customer service needs. Do need recognize good help or encourage workers. Poor leadership is a huge problem. No team efforts.
bad,very poo management. The hours they give you are not want you ask for less than average. the pay was less than what you're working for. its a okay company but not the best.
bad,Not a positive work environment at all.  Management lacked management skills.  No appreciation for the hard work that was placed on a daily basis.  Good luck.
bad,Company leaders do not care about employees. Store management is more concerned about protecting their own job rather than what is best for the company.
bad,I worked there for almost eight years. They where not good with employees. They would get upset with you if you had to take a restroom break. If we where busy there was time we didn't get a lunch.
bad,It was so boring all i did all day every day was water flowers. I learned about the many types of flowers which was fun but that about it. I made some new friends while i was there.
bad,"Company throws you to the wolves.  ""Extensive training involves two days of meaningless computer work and learning the ""company cheer""!  Not things that are helpful at all."
bad,hated the job would never work there again I learned nothing management is jumbled workplace culture is very stress and management is unsupportive worst job ever
bad,Can't wait to find a better job.management has alot to b desired.poor communication with employees.Way to much favoritism.never now what shift in may be working from one day to the next.
bad,Staffing was low .. corpt changed all policies .. when you are liked by management anything goes if management does not like you you will be treated poorly
bad,outside all the time and driving forklife. work all the time. load people car with stuff that they buy from lowes. great work envirement to be in if you like fast moving
bad,"overworked, never enough employees to cover departments, store manager manipulates and insults employees, total lack of respect for employees, expect to work your job and several other positions"
bad,I feel lowes is unorganized and unprofessional and one person will say to do something one way and another will say to do the same thing a different way. I feel they do not train someone how to do there job they just throw you in with no knowledge on how to do your job out of pure laziness
bad,Lowe's is a terrible place to work because of management. If corporate would come in and clean house it would actually be a great place to work. They claim to be all about customer service but there not. I've never seen so many unhappy customers and angry people until i worked for Lowe's.
bad,"Managers would hide form customers, not answer the phone or duck when every issues come up. They were more concerned about looking good than tuning a good store.  No consistency as managers changes shifts you might start a project and then be told why are you doing that? by the next manager."
bad,"Rule with Iron Fist. Poor Management.  You are a number.  It doesn't matter how passionate or hard you work, its about how brown your nose it.  Poorly staffed, Skeleton doesn't even scrape the surface of the issue"
bad,"There was no respect of the employee. Working conditions was poor and the store was dirty and unorganized. There was a lack of personnel which made the employees run all over the store doing every type jobs. Helping customers, which was what my job was, but I was required to clean the restrooms, unloading trucks."
bad,understaffed and can care less about the employees. Not worth you're time working here find something else for 10$ an hour and constant up and down schedule every 2 weeks.
bad,Skeleton crew on the best of days. Not a day when there is enough coverage. Scramble to cover lunches. Managers are lazy and ignorant when st their best. The website and ads are lies. The inventory is always wrong. God forbid someone calls in sick. Managers on registers for hours.
bad,Lowes is a great company to work for. It has a good balance for family life and gives you an opportunity to grow with the company and achieve as much as you as you want.
bad,No help with work schedule. Poor consideration by management after stating I was also working another part time job. would never go back for any reason after the unpleasant atmosphere.
bad,"It is a terrible place to work! No work life balance. The management lacks vision and direction. Very poor management skills and love playing the ""games."" Extremely unprofessional!"
bad,"When I worked for Lowes, it was being managed horribly.  So understaffed that we would work right up to DOT limits of no more than 14 hours of driving a day.  "
bad,lowes dont care about there people they take advanctist of there workersi learned nothing from this company.work place was for a circle of people.self control
bad,was not a good company to work for.no advancement oppritunutys. They do not care about there employees and I would not recommend working for Lowes.f-------------
bad,"Had an unproductive reorganization in March 2017."
bad,"Forget  lowes forget lowes "
bad,The only time the managers come out of hiding is when the corporate clipboard mafia show up to grade the store for neatness and cleanliness. The store is almost always gritty and a huge mess. My department manager even cleaned today. Nobody had any idea the managers knew how. Or even where the supplies were. The closing people the night before a visit spend extra hours of their time to do cleaning that the understaffed store so badly needs.
bad,"Worked there for more than 8 months and they started blaming stuff on me that I didnt do. This went on for a couple months until they finally brought me into the office and fired me, they said they didnt have a reason for it but it was effective immediately. I do not reccomend working here unless you want to work shifts that are all over the place and get yelled at in front of customers for absolutely nothing."
bad,They tell you when you get hired in that you will get 40 hours one week and then about 25 the next but they don't tell you your hours will be cut to 10 after being there for a mth yes they pay good put with the pay they cut the hours to be like ever other company and they are poor on treating there employees and they do alot of favortism as well I will not recommend Lowe's to anyone not even my dog and that says a lot.
bad,I liked working for lowes when i first started but then the managers yelled at you and they made a difference between employees within the group they created.
bad,It‚Äôs a dying company. Rotting from within. Nothing positive to say. I would tell people to run far away from this company. Zero communication. No respect for employees.
bad,if your all about being stuck sitting at a desk all day tied to a headset and not having any freedom besides which corner of the computer screen you could look at then the by all means live it up.
bad,"The hours are inconsistent.  As a full-time employee, you do get rotating days off, but the hours are wacky and inconsistent.  It's rare you know what hours you will be working until the schedule comes out."
bad,it really doesnt matter i will never work there or shop there again.  customer service is the last thing they care about.  and it is really none of your business what i think about the company
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here, too much favoritism and not a well balenced team. I did not enjoy working here. I, along with the rest of the dept mgrs were demoted,"
bad,"It was just miserable. hours were cut, the supervisor was a drug addict, everyone was hostile, it was just not a place i could see myself later in life"
bad,Burning all employee. Stressful place to be working. Bad communication. unsafe place to work. Horrible Schedules. Bad Training.  The standards at this place was very poor.
bad,"The people were the hardest to leave.  Management caused problems all the time, especially when we called for help.  Hardest part was not having help."
bad,this is the worst place to work ever. they will treat you with no respect under pay you and over work you making you do everyone elses job. management will never have your back.
bad,"people never showed up for work so I had to cover their shift and ended up getting over time hours but ended up getting in trouble so they cut my hours to 8 hours a week,"
bad,"I did not like Lowe's.  I had very little control over my schedule and this lack of control made it very difficult to do anything other than work for Lowes."
bad,Very faced paced work environment. Must be able to multi task daily to get your job done. Retail customer service. Ok management. No work home life balance.
bad,"They place corporate profits WAY above human beings, especially the human beings that actually make the corporate profits in the first place.  Low paying, no benefits (that anyone can afford), etc. etc. etc.  We all know the drill."
bad,Do not recommended to anyone to seek employment with Lowe's as they will not provide a living wage.  This was never meant to be a long term job.  The management and co-workers at this specific store in Anderson are all very admirable and hard working.
bad,"Promise's not kept , they lie to you in interview to get you to take the job , then cut your hours . Bad experience overall . Stay away from this place is you want to pay you bills"
bad,Bad place to work. Bad management except for the front end. Dont work here. Quit after a year of being overworked and under appreciated. Minimum wage is definitely not enough to pay for this job. The people either sucked or were the best. Sadly a lot of unfriendly unhelpful coworkers.
bad,Management is very uniformed and doesn't care about employees. You can't ask them any questions because they wont know the answers. This often will lead to customers getting angry.
bad,"After forty one years in the work force, the nine that I spent working here were the worst!"
bad,"NOOO work/life balance. It's swing shift, whatever ""store Needs"" are."
bad,"At first I liked my job. Until I realized how much favoritism there was, how hard it is to move up in the company,  often they hire out of the store instead of promoting. Management  decides to make up there own rules, management has become so bad, they throw people in departments they've never worked in before with no training or help. Service managers are often rude."
bad,"My boss kept forgetting my name, the managers didn't even know I worked there, no mater how much you did it was never enough.  They want you to work around their time but could never really set anything up on days off not knowing if I was going to be called in or not."
bad,Lowe's Lakewood Management never looked at me for job advancement even with three years of service.  I was treated as if my work there did not matter.
bad,Good coworker. And a company that needs better management and better pay rates and better work hrs plus lack of communication and not enough of training
bad,"poor management, back stabbing co-workers, poor hours, lack of proper amount of employees, always guilty until proven innocent,more focus on doing other things than your primary job"
bad,Working at Lowe's was a very stressful and unfulfilling job that required me to take on multiple jobs all while trying to provide  customer satisfaction while being harassed by the management team to take on even more responsibility. Their management over there is very lacking in human relations.
bad,"At store where I worked, not a good environment.  At first with the store manager (Female), very personal and direct with approach to make the store #1.  Every manager after, not engaged with advancement of staff within.  You had to be the right ""color"", with the right ""attitude"" to be considered for advancement!"
bad,lowes is in transition alot of changes being put in place...heavy turn over in all positions..company is trying to become more of an online business but the web site will not support it
bad,"Cooking and preparing food for guests."
bad,"High turnover. Always tired because of the extra hours that salaried management is required to put in without adequate compensation."
bad,Lowes is a job were you get no respect from anyone this includes managers and co-workers. The hours are awful the work environment is completely unsafe and the amount of stress you have to deal with is beyond anything I have ever dealt with before.
bad,Started out enjoying this job but I find the management is sexist and doesn't care about equal opportunities at all. Managers will hire 5 part timers to avoid giving anyone full time. Lowe's in Wilkesboro is a very poor ran company.
bad,"Warehouse worker, forklift driver, was in charge of loading and unloading trucks, making sure trucks were ready to go and inventory done. Used the stand up forklift, sit down and cherry picker"
bad,"They have fired good employees for no cause and they have sued."
bad,Don't go there. It's a terrible racist work environment. They generally don't care about people's safety either. It's so disrespectful and disgusting.
bad,"Nunca se tuvo un plan u objetivos claros por parte de la Gerencia la cual tuvo muchos cambios y provoco constante rotaci√≥n de personal, la carga de trabajo era demasiada ya que no se tenia el personal necesario."
bad,"Horrible experience working here. Some managers and employees were beyond malicious, bad-natured and verbally abusive. One manager in particular would belittle employees in front of customers and other employees. If you go to upper management about work place issues, they are no help and are completely unprofessional. It reminded me of being in high school all over again. I would NOT recommend working at this location."
bad,"Working with customer and employuees to assure that the daily task were comepleted per manager standards. Frieght flow, scanning shelves to assure that the products were priced and full ."
bad,While working at lowes I hardly recieved my scheduled breaks and lunches. It was awful and i hated being there. Management would favorite employees and chose who got breaks and lunches. They wouldnt pay enough for the amount of work they had us do. I was a cashier but they required me to learn Customer Service without adding anything to my pay. My experience there was awful and i wouldnt  wish it on anyone.
bad,It was always busy with very little staff. Customers complained all the time there was not more people there to help. Management was too lazy to hire more people or help their workers.
bad,"Need more help in the store. "
bad,"This is the worst job. Low pay compared to other call centers. Supervision and management is a joke..unless you are favored by them. Your work schedule is inconsistent. "
bad,"I loved the customers and the people I worked with, I learned a lot about there computer system, hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management, from head cashiers to the top."
bad,a day at lowes starts out with the person that comes in at the beginning of the the day running around like a mad man trying to get everything up and running and then trough out the day everyone tries to watch out for themselfs and not offer any kind of help
bad,"Ok for a part time job, not so great for full time work. Store is ALWAYS under staffed. Management was alright and has been becoming progressively worse"
bad,they are a cut throat business i wouldn't even shop there they lie they cheat they only promote who they like and not who deserve it Management does nothing but sit and eat in office all day they tell you one thing about your job but you are never doing that your treated like a slave no help at all
bad,"The store was poorly ran. The permanent hires were people who called out on a regular basis during the trial period. My shift usually began in the middle of the day, so it didn't leave time for much else."
bad,"Pay is good, But the amount of work needed to do the job is not worth the pay. Management didn't know what was going on. Very stressful. not a good job/life balance"
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management has no care for the employees and the same for the store manager."
bad,"People constantly call out, late, or didn't show up at all, and management didn't care. If you follow rules, they will just use you.  Stay away from this place"
bad,"did not like it there, typical retail. went from pushing carts to delivery associiate which was 10 times more work for the same pay and when i tried to talk to managment about it, they would keep coming up with stupid policies to justify it."
bad,"The workplace culture is horrible. Lowe's isn't the place it was many years again. It was a feel of family life, now you feel like someone has a knife in you back. Its not a good place to work now."
bad,The work at Lowes is horrible especially if you work as an Loader/Buggie returner. Lowes does not hire enough people to help outside in the lot to handle the work load of there busy store. You will normally be the solo person work outside trying and felling to keep buggies in. and you nearly can't take breaks since that would mean the lot would be unattended and you would be behind nearly the rest of the day
bad,"I work overnight so there is no life balance. On top of that there is no shift differential or paid benefits expect paid time off. Job security is no existent since there recent fired hundred of managers company wide with little to no notice and I know that anyone could fill my position. Management is terrible because there are roughly 14 different managers in the store; all of which want to give me tasks. That is of course all of them but my immediate manager, who doesn't give anyone direction at all. As far as culture is concerned, the company is so worried about being run out of business by online retailers that they have ridiculous expectations. They recently cut the workforce in half and expect the remaining employees to do twice as much. The only thing that might be enjoyable would be the paycheck but for the amount of work required to get earn in it, it seems like more of a cruel joke."
bad,Worst job I ever had. Management were dumb stupid morons. The best part of my job was leaving. Workplace culture was stab'em in the back and rat on everybody.
bad,"short staffed, over worked, people are quitting left and right and they do not hire new people to replace them, no possibility of advancement, ask for a raise? good luck, managers and HR do not care about you, no one listens to yours issues, corporate is greedy, no such thing as full-time anymore, they will work you just under 40hrs so you do not get benefits, you will work 8 to 9 days in a row, kiss your weekends goodbye last one I had was almost a year ago, you will see no sign of appreciation, you work so hard and have no money to show for you WILL live barely check to check, bi-weekly pay is awful, and managers play favorites."
bad,"A typical day at work was dealing with stressed out, and upset customers, and stressed out staff.  I learned how to deal with a high stress job.   The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at for things out of my control."
bad,"Laid off,great company lots of hours and responsibilities.more auditing than actual shoplifting apprehensions. Overall learning of every store functions."
bad,"This store changed dramatically because of owners greed. They no longer need full time, efficient, money making, and dependable employees.  The management that is left, dont care, give no support, are hiding all the time, over look employees issues, are prejudice to the older folks, give way to the younger, they discredit you and make you feel insufficient."
bad,I was only allowed to work like 2 days a week so up in grand forks it was not good and it just did not work out for me at all. i learned that in grand forks they dont care about college students.
bad,"Lowe's is a toxic environment due to the astonishing amount of RUDE, unpleasant, ignorant customers that will stop at nothing until you feel like the dumbest most worthless person in the world. People in other departments are lazy for the most part and will not do their jobs, so customers take out all of their anger on the cashiers. All management cares about is being rich and will work you to death and schedule you outside of your availability all for a few pennies a day. do not work here."
bad,Poor management. Too short of hour for the amount of work that needed to be done. Some days were stressful and other days I hated being there. Managers are rude.
bad,"I loved my final position I held with Lowe's Department/Cash Manager. But after 20 years things started going bad with management and they were letting old timers go and hiring part timers for less money than the full timers where making, the star rating are all ones except the benefits would be a 5"
bad,"Poor treatment and abuse of employee's. Career advancement based on favoritism. Hour cuts based on punishment.  Refusal to take Doctor's notes/allow leave for sick intermediate family (basically if you or your spouse have a severe illness and you have to take leave or take sick days you are penalized for it, and eventually fired). I would not recommend working for this company, there is no room for advancement, and you are taken advantage of if you work hard and diligently because the management and staff like to mess around."
bad,Bad place to have a career watch your back don't. expect to move up due to the restructuring of the company no support from upper management dealing with customer and employee complaints nobody does what they are suppose to do
bad,To many people telling you whay to do and they all want theirs done first   store manager looks for ways to back stab good employees.  Most employes work real hard and get nothing for it.
bad,Lowes was a  horrible company to work for. They did not care about their employees. I worked 12 hour shifts with barely any time to take lunch. The store manager was never around and had no plan of discipline
bad,"Managers sleeping with employees, corporate does nothing about it and black list you for future employment. Also have a bad habit of randomly going through and firing for no reason. Especially management if they feel they're not making enough profit at a particular store."
bad,"your bosses treat you like trash, customers treat you like trash, co-workers treat you like trash. everyone is depressed and hates their work life and so will you!"
bad,toxic culture not looking out for the employee just the company. They only care about the top 40 companies list not the best places to work list over all I would not work for them again.
bad,toxic work environment. management treats employees awful and the shifts are terrible. I was harassed and nothing was done about it. I asked about my shifts and they retaliated by making fake write ups.
bad,"Lowes has the worst management I've ever seen. The work flow is bad, the co workers do things only for them selves, nobody helps eachother out, it's outrageous. I can't stand that environment anymore."
bad,"As a cashier, my responsibilities were to run the sales floor; maintaining cleanliness and assisting customers with their building project and provide any extensive knowledge learned to provide best customer service and devolving affable reports with customers. Hardest part of the job was answering/transferring phone calls while greeting and ringing customers up. although, I over exceeded and the best part, became that much better a performer."
bad,Terrible job hours are all over the place. Only a few get to be full time the rest (part time) hours vary greatly each week also there are no set schedules.
bad,"Lowe's CPO is the most unorganized organization that I've worked for. Management is not helpful, HR is a joke. There is no training program or schedule. It's just an overall terrible place to work for."
bad,"got alot of hours but the management wasnt willing to change my schedule, work load wasnt evened out, most of the days i was by myself doing 3-4 other peoples jobs. too many ""managers"" who want to tell you what to do, but cant do their job correctly."
bad,Do n0t work for this company! They are restructuring th3e company so many people are being forced out of their positions to make room for part time associates they can pay less.
bad,"I was not happy with the overall environment at lowe's, some of the staff members were horrible to new associates. Some of the staff at Lowe's were degrading with other staff members. It is not a job I would recommend"
bad,"On a typical work day it was stressful and no assistance from other staff. Was pretty much left on my own to figure things out. "
bad,I love working with the customers and contractors it's very rewarding when you see you've helped them make a project less stressful I just wish the atmosphere I work in was better
bad,"this job is very friendly , but otherwise the customer service is very poorly and so is staff and facility . they don't help with much when I ask for help. also co-workers are very unfriendly and rude."
bad,"This place was decent to work at 10 years ago. Now they are only motivated by stock price. Employees at the store level are treated terribly then smoothed over with cookouts. Managers are egotistical and lack the ability to lead efficiently. "
bad,I disliked working here given the fact that while in school I was written up for not coming in to work while in high school classes that I could not miss.
bad,Was a good job till changed store manager . They seem to have no interests in what employees have to say. Most of time won't even acknowledge you when walk by. No communication at all.
bad,"The computers are so outdated, set up in a confusing maze of options and crash fairly regularly. Sexism and nepotism run rampant. Don't think the managers are there to help you and the customers. They sit in the offices and yell at you if they get any interruptions. 15 minute breaks are for the favorite few who do NOTHING all day. One person will get all the work for 5-6 departments because of cutbacks, call outs and dragging floor people off for projects that aren't their job. Corporate higher ups get big bonuses, workers get low pay and their jobs threatened."
bad,"Field management team is a group of poor leaders. They barely speak to the store team members. When and if they do they make the employees feel like they are doing them a favor. A lot of good people working in the stores. Many are hard workers, but if you kiss the right butt in management you can do what ever you want. Senior management are barely ever seen. The pay hs to be the worst in the industry."
bad,"Not enough pay, chronically understaffed, management was a joke, and its almost impossible to get your time off approved. Overall pass this company up, and keep looking."
bad,"This place is not only a terrible place to shop but also a terrible place to work. Not only did I experience several terrible instances of bigotry and homophobia, but I also unfortunately encountered racism and other negativity as well. Several instances of unethical treatment to the workers, and no proper handling of anything at all by management. The store manager doesn't even know how to work a register let alone manage an entire store. Takes 4 hour lunches while all the other employees were only permitted 1 hour. No solid breaks. Terrible customer base."
bad,"I worked at the new location in Prince George since last summer- Helped with mass receiving and worked my butt off everyday. When the store opened the turn over was MASSIVE, due to terrible management and placing the worst department managers. Fast forward to almost a year later, the management lie to the staff, make them feel worthless and becomes a place that you are not excited to go to everyday. While most associates were getting paid upwords of $17 and hour cashiers are stuck at $11.65-$12. Do not recommend working for this company"
bad,"The management isn't great. & it's very hard to talk to someone. They also mess up your schedule a lot with your availability. Akon with that, you have to like suck up to the higher people. They use you"
bad,"It is way to stressful of a place to work for a place that sells birdseed.  Recently management  went through a restructure.  Since then management positions are filled with incompetent, lazy individuals who want to talk a big game about teamwork and servant leadership.   Teamwork does not exist.  It is definitely not worth putting up with lists of work to do from 7 different managers and dealing with customers for the amount of money you will be paid.  Worst  place on I've worked."
bad,"exhausting job duties, work independently, no help, overloaded and unrealistic expectations.  The job started out acceptable but after some time it has become almost unbearable.  Management changes has cause a lowering of morale and it is not the happy place it used to be."
bad,"After the whole management change. It's been a downward spiral. Instead of actually keeping their employees happy. The managers make sure they get their bonuses."
bad,"A normal day is unsatisfied customers miserable supervisors and cashiers who are stuck in the middle of it. Advancement is only for an outsider. People don't care what they do/who they step on to get through the day."
bad,the only thing I can say about Lowes is it is a place to work if it feels your needs.  It is not a place for long term employment  Part time is perfect.
bad,Summer job in the garden center. The store was very unorganized. I received very little training if any. Coworkers were generally unpleasant with the exception of a few.
bad,Morale is very low and management doesn't care. They change your schedule for days that already happened and mark you as no call no show. They feel they can get away with anything. They do not want to allow certain employees to take unpaid days. They play favorites and no one is treated the same. HR is mean and uncaring. HR doesn't help you when you ask for help she just gets defensive or doesn't reply to your emails at all. HR has been seen yelling at fellow employees in the middle of the break room.  I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,I don't have anything to say. You are not treated with respect when you have a complaint nothing is done about it they only respond to managers and head cashiers and their problems
bad,"Enjoyed working with a great group of employees, while gaining experience with customer service, talking and assisting customers in selection of products."
bad,Employer is only concerned with the bottom line and does not care about employees. All management is concerned with is making their bonus each quarter and takes no time to assist or train employees.
bad,"hated working for this place, they are racists and lie about what they said and did to upper management. hated i started working for this ratchet company. i would really tell you how i feel but yall may not like what i say because i will hurt their feelings."
bad,I've been with lowes for 10 years and over that time I have seen them eliminate far more positions than bring in. I rose up the ranks only to be cut after a restructure because I made too much money for my management position along with half the management staff. With those cuts Lowes is vastly under staffed and having customers walk out everyday because they can't get help. If your looking for a career I would strongly advise you to look elsewhere.
bad,I got overtime and bonuses. I got paid to do nothing at first until they wanted me to quit. Then they had me loading stones to cars and I know that's a man's job
bad,"Its retail.  Weekend hours, long hours, pay is not the best and there is always a push to reduce cost and manpower so resources are limited to get the job accomplished but still expected to be accomplished."
bad,"Working there is ridiculous they only hire seasonal,  and if you tell them that you have another job they ask you to only work for them and they said yes still hire you wan after the contract ends well that's a lie . There full-time people that were hired from the Day 1 the store open some are still there  and they treat  The people on contract really bad I don't recommend anybody to apply to this job"
bad,Lowe's customers are the worst. The company could care less about paying the people that actually make the corp the money. I had people threaten my life and to do harm to me and was told by management to shut up or they would fire me when I complained to them about it.
bad,"Typical retail environment with long hours, less than appreciative management and no direction.  Job culture was less positive and turn over rate was high."
bad,"Upper management are targeting older and higher paid employees such as specialists and department managers with abusive treatment and fabricated write- up to fire them. They are being replaced with minimum wage kids who know nothing, have no work ethic and don't care about the customers.  "
bad,"Lowes in a great place to make some pretty fun friends to work with and you can meet a lot of interesting people, but management are bullies. I hated my experience with management."
bad,"Lowes management sets poor examples for their employees. They violate all their policies, yet hold their lowest tier of employees accountable. It is no wonder, there are so many call outs"
bad,"Lowes was a great place to work, easy to move up. I moved from part time warehouse to part time Sales floor. Once I got to the Sales floor I wasn't taught on the differences of certain products or how to run certain machinery. I was bored, walking around the department looking for something to clean or townsfolk."
bad,"Typical retail location. Works workers who do work hard, lets other who don't just float around. No room for advancement. Don't make this place a career."
bad,This was an enjoyable job with many opportunities to excel. Management was always eager to help with any questions you may have. There was a 5 week training period that seemed very long but I learned a lot in that time.
bad,"They treat their employees okay. Schedule you open and closes when you're not trained for it. One manager will tell you to do one thing and another manager will yell at you for it. They fired me cause I wasn't a fast enough worker. Instead of putting me into a department that I'm more knowledgeable, they get rid of me."
bad,With the high expectations of a corporate hardware firm you would expect them to cater to their clients needs over corporate gains.  I would prefer to work in a ma and pa minded organization.
bad,Unstable and dishonest company that would rather have you in India. Hates American jobs. I was Sr leadership here for years and could take it anymore. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
bad,Extremely negative environment; very little positive reinforcement; inconsistent scheduling; little room for advancement; unforetold mass seasonal layoffs.
bad,You're expected to run your legs off and still get reamed for doing the right thing for the company.  Management is poor and a huge joke.  They are qualified to walk around the four corners and not much else.
bad,"do not work here. "
bad,They say anyone could steal but they accuse almost anybody‚Äã who look poor of stealing. They accused my sister and she came in the store looking for me. They talk about everyone on the walky talky. It's embarrassing.
bad,"They fired my father, the number one salesman in the company at the time, because of a misunderstanding that he proved to them that it wasn't what they thought. They even admitted to this, but they decided to fire him anyways."
bad,"New manager was no help... new service mangers had no training nor did the ASMs .. "
bad,They will let you go in a heartbeat they are cutting all full time and all managers so the big shots can pad their pockets more than they already are. The stress and hours they make you work are not good for anyone.
bad,bad management .wont give you the shift you would prefer. not very good training. not willing to work with the your schedule. clueless coworkers. dont work here
bad,"Part time or full time"
bad,"Management is not concerned about hourly associates or their family needs. Company trends behind Walmart, while execs make horrible investments out of the states and the hourly employees feel the the aftermath of their bad descisions."
bad,"Was very hard to work for , under staffed all the time. Management more interested in bottom line than employees well being.Unaware of whats happening in there store.Compensation has no incentives, small bonuses very hard to achieve."
bad,"Poor place to work if you like security cameras at every point in the building. Management backs up the customer and not the employee."
bad,They lie about there temporary hire time basis. And they fire you without any notice which is redicoulous. The managers are not business like at all and arent very compassionate when it comes to there employers
bad,It has been so long since I worked here that its a bit blurry. I remember it was fun but the pay was awful as it still is I am sure. I would like to think this is a great place for a college kid to work.
bad,"I do not recommend working here, management is terrible. They work you hard and do not want you take a lunches managers having affairs with associates"
bad,"They don't care about the associates all they care about is appealing to Wall Street. "
bad,Terrible......I left a company for Lowe's who is clearly out of touch with customer service and store appearance. Hated every minute I was there and was glad I was laid off.
bad,"Management team is not all that great. Two people on oppsite sides of the field when they should be on the same side working together"
bad,Treated as a number more than an employee. Your work is not appreciated and the higher ups put all of the work on lower employees so that they do not have to work.
bad,"The company has changed and the management treats you like a thing ,not a person. They are deceptive, and judgmental. not a place to grow. They cap your advancement ."
bad,"I was recruited from a stable job to come to this nightmare  don't be fooled by the open door policy and fake smiles. Everyone is out for themselves and will walk all over you. I was lured with promises of bonuses which were non existence. Pay attention to the multi job openings there is many reasons for it. Most of the ASM'S and Dm's are just waiting in line for their slice of the pie and will throw you under the bus to get it.  The store managers endless bad decisions in which the store lost money to satisfy a customer was overwhelming, it didn't matter if customers threaten you with harm, they are still taken care of. No one is happy at this store. Constant bad mouthing, cold shoulder mean girl type of behaviour from both genders. Very toxic environment and the rules for the red vest are endless and other associates love to run and tell on you. I wish  had never set foot in this place. No training provided or even a general care for your personal wellbeing, as long as you were making sales."
bad,"Stocking products and merchandising plants. How to be unhappy at work. Poor management, stressful cultural. Hard to go to work on a daily basis. Payday was the highlight."
bad,"I was offered a FSA position which was full time but at a pay rate 12.28, way below the pay rate scale for the area. Not worth what they were expecting the FSA to do."
bad,"Worked there recently for a year. Very circular logic when it comes to rules and how to follow them when a customer calls corporate. Work environment sucks because everyone is fighting over hours and throws each other under the bus. The management is either patronizing or completely in their own world. Barely any workers on the floor and as a customer service manager I would constantly be the one to be yelled at because a multi billion dollar company cannot afford staffing their store."
bad,"Same as previous review: It's not the worst place to work, but it is far from the best. There are many areas of the store where you can learn new things. That knowledge is great, and the people are generally good."
bad,"Treat there employes verry bad, make them do 100 things at once pay them the min wage treat you less then a number, worst place to work rather pick up horse dung all day then work for this company"
bad,"not a great job, management is horrible and childish. waste of time and wear on vehicle for little compensation. The staff was pretty civil though"
bad,"Worked closely with management and other associates, as well as alone. Management was very helpful at teaching and support. Customers could be difficult at times, that is when my excellent customer service skills and ability to work with a diverse amount of people came in handy. Hardest part of the job was definitely the schedule of a week straight with zero days off.The best part was interacting with so many different people, customers and co-workers."
bad,"Terrible place to work. You are always going to find nice people at any job, that doesn't count. They are sales driven and don't balance work between shifts. They pay horrible, don't pay proper wages for the job and expect a lot for minimum wage. Pay the people what they are worth!"
bad,The only good thing about the Lowe's RDC is that it is a clean place to work. The pay is really low. The management is even worse. People get written up or fired for making small mistakes like dropping packages from pallets.
bad,"This is a company that does not care about its employees. I got to see first hand how the store manager and HR manager conspire against employees that they can't manipulate or that are older/more tenured employees. They expect you to help them with their ""dirty work"" and if you don't, you will be one of he ones that are gone. Filing a complaint with corporate has been proven to be ineffective. If you are looking for a secure job where your hard work and dedication is what matters, this is not the company for you. If you enjoy being a ""yes"" man and have no moral fiber about yourself, this may be a good fit."
bad,"Lowes advertises that they are all about the employees, this is not true. I was a department manager there when the corporation decided that we were no longer needed and did a cross country position wipe of managers. ASMs were also laid off with a very weak and horrible pension plan. They have schedules working you till 10 pm then opening at 5 am, They have stretches of 7 days with no days off. You will be written up whether you were in the hospital or your parent died. This is not a company that cares. Due to their newest change there is also no room for advancement. work here at your own risk."
bad,"Worked this position for 3 years part time and it was the worst ! Go in at 6am just to work 4 -5 hours is a waste of time ! And they'll tell you you can have every other weekend off which is a lie . I worked every single weekend from 6-11am. If you request time off they'll decline Your request, due to your the only one who knows how to work the position other than the management who will refuse to work the cash office because they also hate that job . Then when you apply to work other position you won't be selected because they don't want to train someone else to work in the cash office ."
bad,"its all about money with them "
bad,"layoffs every few years always cutting management staff, very clickish. Stay away stay far far away.......great place to get discounts on merchandise"
bad,"They don't care about  the people who made the company all they care about is money."
bad,This is a company that is lost and only doing things to try and make the Wall Street people think they're moving in the right direction. The are followers of Home Depot and not leaders.
bad,"Not a real living, just a stepping stone. The pay is not enough to support anyone. Management is usually a joke. The customer is always right and you have to take a lot of abuse"
bad,"Overall the culture there is very negative which all stems from the management.  Team members are nice and so are most of the coaches.  The atmosphere though is bad do to the management.  Safety is all they talk about, but they will not fix the shipping rollers making you have to poke boxes down the lines all the time.  When you bring it up, you are them considered a complainer.  Management will not acknowledged you, unless you talk to them first.  There is also no open door policy there, if you go to HR for problem your manager will find out what you told HR just making it  worse for yourself.  Building is old and dark inside and the roof leaks everywhere when it rains, but they are all about safety.  Also lots of overtime and if you are salary no compensation for it, you are expected to work months of overtime and then every other Friday as well.  I hope that not all Lowes RDC's are run the way this one is, if so I don't know how the company stays in business.  Working here was the worst job that I ever had, just do to the fact of the managers they chose to run the shifts and the building.  Take this into consideration before applying!"
bad,"This is the worst job that I have ever had. The company does not care about employees. Management does not care about employees, all they care about is their numbers as far as sales. There were many times someone would call in, and you would not be allowed to take a break or take a lunch because they were short staffed. "
bad,"Lowe's has gone the way of Wal-Mart, undercompensating and understaffing. They have stopped hiring professionals and stopped paying spiffs. The bonuses they promise are intentionally out of reach. Management is juvenile and retaliates against employees."
bad,Low pay and lots of pressure. You are responsible for blowing sunshine up everyone's butt and making sure everyone is happy or you are the one who takes the blame when they aren't. This job is horrible and no one respects you.  You take the blame for not being trained and for low EOS scores. Be prepared to want to cry most weeks. They think one person can change the entire store but with old school employees it's nearly impossible. It's also impossible to let go of horrible employees but then you are questioned why nothing changes. Don't accept this position.
bad,"Worst company ever to work for. Bad management, unorganized, lack of training, and bad customer service. Lack of hours, no man power to run the store."
bad,"If your planning to work at the lowes at signahill youll regret  it. Bad management  and hr won't  respect  you, ps, if you cut yourself   your fired.."
bad,"-90% Cheaply made Chinese products"
bad,"I have two reason for me reaching out to you are: 1) at some point in the past you were exploring new insurance for Home, Auto or both.  2) I'm looking to expand my customer base by offering a no obligations insurance analysis.  Now I have been in the insurance industry for the last couple of years, but I have recently started with the PMG Group powered by Allstate.  One reason that I'm excited to be with this office is Allstate is offering a range of new discounts and incentives for new customers."
bad,Clean and maintain restrooms. Make repairs as needed. Management could have been better. Coworkers were ok. Hardest part doing the jobs nobody wanted to do. But wanted me to do.
bad,"low wage, hassled by mang. "
bad,I was working there as a seasonal sales associate but was moved to assembly cause I mumble to myself which is something I have don't since I was a kid.
bad,"I worked at lowes foods not lowes home improvement, they don't have a deli, and now I have to fill this space with nonsense because I have never worked for this company"
bad,"they lie, and make things up while allowing drug addicts to run heavy machinery  management is well aware  they endanger their employees and customers"
bad,"Nearly no training provided for the tasks being asked of higher up employees. If you want to be a cashier, they will give you all the training you need."
bad,"Store manager only wants to hire part time workers at minimum wage in order to cut costs on salary as well as full-time benefits. This allows the store to operate in the green, but it sacrifices the knowledgeable employees for the minimum wage employees and the customer is the one who gets negatively effected. Another example of a corporate company that only wishes to please its shareholders and everything else is 2nd to that."
bad,"Was hired full time.  Was told after starting and during orientation that what they really meant was seasonal.   Advised Manager that April is the end of season in Florida.  Was told that this is the way Lowe's separates the ""what from the chaff.""  Lousy Management.  Work for Home Depot now full time.  Better company - Better Management."
bad,"Uses people  if its good for the company  ,,then it work s but if you have a order  going up god forbidden that uou siign in early  i worked there 5 years and worked  my butt"
bad,"This was the worst job because it was based within a right to work state.. The employees had no ideals or work distinction, there were selfish."
bad,"The work atmosphere is very stressful, to much responsibility laid upon the employees shoulders, including the managers duties"
bad,This does respect and did consider the employee . Very bad management . Personally i don't have any feeling and will never advice someone go go that company
bad,"Was a great weekend job with a great team. Able to work in a fun professional environment with great managers, and professional sales equipment designed to help the employees and customers find what they wanted."
bad,"The hours you work are terrible, they are all over the place, it is impossible to plan ahead, seeing how the schedule is only put out 5 days in advance. the Management team plays favorites, and if you are not in the cool crowd ( like high school) good luck moving up the ladder, the employees that work there are great, this job is great if you are right out of high school or just retired looking for part time work. For the rest of us however, its not a place to make a career, just use them as a stepping stone to get to somewhere better."
bad,Management is very poor and schuldeing is very poor as well as some coworkers. they give little rases and its if they like u if u advance in the company
bad,"The good things"
bad,"Helping customers"
bad,Communication is the number one issue at this particular store. The management team were not strong leaders and that was evident for the whole team.
bad,get out of retail this company will run you into the ground and take advantage of those who have great work ethic and want to get ahead
bad,"overall a bad experience,would not allow me to excell i tried and tried to apply to other positions and they just wouldnot allow me to grow,you have to be in the circle or you will not excell and you have to be a K A if you want to grow,i never liked working there i only held on cause i did not have anything else"
bad,"Not a place to work if your an adult. There is no advancement. All the manager hires is part time kids still going to school. The less hours and no benefits, gives the manger a bigger bonus. When I first started working there, it smelled of old, dry blood from the meat department. And now that I am no longer employed there, it will smell again."
bad,"Very poor management skills,  lot of favoritism, team member can't progress, most of the coaches or supervisors have no idea how to manage team member. GM is always threatening team member to letting them go."
bad,not a good job poor teamwork poor pay and not a very good place to work given what was demanded of you and what was compensated.
bad,"Don't bother unless you're into things like eating ramen, wondering how you're going to pay for gas, child support, etc.  Hours are not their strong suit."
bad,I cant stand working here. You don't get enough hours and the management always have a bad attitude. you don't get hours unless your a full time employee. i work 4 days a week 4 hour shifts each day. i don't even make enough to pay my bills. hence why i gained other employment
bad,They don't care for the employees not do they care for the customer. They offer decent pay for entry level and decent benefits but that's the best thing about lowes.
bad,"Don't work there, you deserve better. If you do work there you will be subject to a non living wage, benefits you can't afford, and a horrible schedule that will ruin your family life. This company puts greed above all else, including workers. You are just another resource to be exploited for the greed of the corporation. Just say no."
bad,"if u r student waiting 4 school, its great. its not for some1 that really needs a job 2 support themselves or others. policies were broken, no 1 cared"
bad,the worst company you can work for nobody wants to train you nobody wants you to succeed in this company the pay is horrible and when you go for a raise they give you a whole 5 cents if that and no bonus for the year the supervisors don't tell you anything about any updates they do not care about anything
bad,"Working for Lowe's for me was Ok in the Beginning Learning something new was a good fit for me.I had 5months under my belt that i had my CDL and was looking forward to driving the Semi Well that didnt happen often i was put on the box truck almost everyday.I would only make deliveries on the Semi maybe Once a Week and i would have to Say Something just to get that.Box Truck deliveries were Terrible now you had some good customers and those that Complain about Everything Customers and it would get back to managerment and i would look like the Bad Person when i wasn't,Second Sale Ppl only Thought about getting the SALE and that's IT.In our Invoices they would be Wrong Information and when you Questioned the Customer they would be MAD at you like it as your Fault.I Would Never Work for Lowe's Again Management only care about NUMBERS and thats it......"
bad,"Great company stock, horrible place to work. Eight hours non-stop on a concrete slab, mentally and physically draining. Mixed up schedules never allows for family and social life. No weekends off, ever. The high end of their pay scale is at the low end of normal other markets, little to no chance of advancement, and NO personal recognition. Very quick to find fault with workers and take punitive measures. It's a job if there's nothing else available."
bad,"Employees slack off and leave the work for the next person working. Closing is the worse, stay till 11pm. Management is screwed up starting with the store manager."
bad,"Management is hard to please. The overall atmosphere is ok depending on what store you work for. Store politics is horrible. Benefits are ok, schedules suck if you have a family. Over worked employees for not so good pay."
bad,"Manager don't properly communicate with each other. Lose prevention will always assume employees are stealing, and will harass employees about it. Spent more time at work proving I wasn't a thief than actually working."
bad,"Management is a joke.  Everyday they fire people for no reason.  They  do not value good employees, your only a number. I would not recommend for anyone to work there."
bad,They make you feel like you never do anything right. Always finding fault. If you stay with the company long enough to  have a good income  you are always afraid they will find a reason to fire you. Everyday you see people getting fired. I used to think they must have deserved it but not in all cases.
bad,"Being  the we were located inside of Kmart right at the front of the store, customers got ver angry because they feel threatned that your not even giving them time to end the store and that your pushy."
bad,The receiving team is the heartbeat of this company. We had to receive everything that came in for the departments to replenish the store.
bad,"low pay, inconsistent hours, typical retail experience not very much to say other wise"
bad,"You are constantly lied to. When I was hired I was told that I wouldn't have to do any overtime until out of my 90 days. I went from working my normal 40 hours a week to having to stay an extra hour, to working every other friday within my first month of working there. They tell you that the numbers are not important however you keeping your numbers about 100 is very important to them. And its very hard to get your numbers on a daily basis. Very rarely do you get approved for vacation requests. Some of the coaches are excellent, however other lack the role of being in charge. When asked yoy might as well tell people you work 5 days a week 11 hrs a day. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there for employment."
bad,"not happy at all,hard to advance unless you have a real manager that has reviewed your past work history thoroughly and knows what kind of history youve had,management that truly appreciates and give raises accordingly not according to what they feel and how you hang on their tail,"
bad,"i was in lowes management and it was not a good experience.you get no real training and no support.you will be responsible for the sales and overall appearance of your department with very little staff to help you.you will get no support when you need it but you will still be expected to run your department as if you have the staff to help you.your upper management is clueless because they haven't been trained properly so they don't know how to help you.i knew more about the system than my assistant store manager did.upper management is only interested in getting promoted and has little interest in helping you.i often refer to lowes as ""organized chaos"""
bad,"just not good places to work at all. if you wanna be treated like a subordinate and work for nothing, go right ahead. Not good pay or hours."
bad,If you aren't kissing butt and befriending the management you are not going anywhere. Hard work will get you no where but doing more hard work.
bad,They don't care about you at all. They expect you to lift 50 lbs even if you are pregnant and it could risk the life your baby and you.
bad,"I would say Lowe's is one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The leadership is non existent, might as well have a robot or monkey run the store. Lack of empathy, sensitivity and certainly compassion. Just a mess, one star is to high of a rating. I would love to speak to the share holders of the pile poo called Lowe's is LOW! I don't have enough time to put down all the negative adjectives that best describes this retail giant."
bad,"I hate the hours, pay, managers, and the work environment. I would never work for the retailer again! Its an ok place to shop but I prefer Home depot they know there product better."
bad,"politics and stressful, lack of hours,no stability,back biting,back stabbing,racism,no breaks, manager has no say in anything.chain of puppets."
bad,"The Company is a joke and anyone who wants to work for them should know that you will pay the price. Unfair or Constructive dismissal is a common thing with this company and they get away with this all the time, the upper management are incompetent like low born Hag trying to deceive the workers and the underlings follow suite are crude Ape's trying to pull out bananas from their respective holes. ."
bad,hated working here you where always having to clean something be the store was nasty they never kept it clean and to long to be on your feet
bad,"Just horrible, the worst warehouse I have ever worked in. Management treats you badly. No respect, ungrateful. I wouldn't recommend any female to work for them."
bad,This company is the worst to work for. Do not even go there to buy anything either. There store manager is a angry person who is never happy. If you do not bow down to this company they make problems for you. They want more from you as an employee but do not want to compensate you for your effects. Do yourself a favor get a job where at least you may make a decent wage. Where maybe you can ex cell for your effects. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS CHEAP COMPANY WOULD BE MY BEST ADVISE.
bad,management sucked. they just let everyone do whatever they wanted to do and would not help the customers like they should.
bad,"Working for Lowes was the worst 4 years of my life! They management team and focus is horrible.  They do not follow protocol and/or procedures.  They state that working as a part time associate you must work every weekend which is not true.  And if management does not like get along with you or dislikes you for any reason, they will attack you every single day they work with you.  And the store manager would defend their management team even they are 100% wrong."
bad,Lowes as a company is a great one. The lowes that I worked at was absolutely nothing but drama. It was hard to even get your work done on a daily basis because of it.
bad,good company to work for just bad hours cant plan anything but thats life in retail thats why i got out looking for something new and advancing faster
bad,Rude people. No team work. Management not so good. Hardest part of my job was listening to the lies. Lifting 75 lbs or more by ur self
bad,"i was a cashier at lowes market and i enjoyed interacting with different individuals, and seeing a smiling new face every day"
bad,"Unless your desperate for a job skip this one! Constant turnover among drivers due to poor management. Zero planning when routes are dispatched resulting in late deliveries, upset customers, Your schedule is never the same and 3 weeks per month you WILL work saturdays and sundays with 1 weekend off. The benefits once were pretty good but changed Jan 2016 and the insurance is high with very high deductables and out of pocket expense... Most drivers last less than 6 months...Skip this experience!"
bad,poor management team no one did their job the HR did not know policies work ethic was poor among co workers hardest part was doing everyones job for them typical day was doing janitorial duty and maintenance
bad,I worked everyday and busted my back for them in hopes that I would be able to stay after the seasonal period was over. I was told many things when I was in my training. I was told I would be making 10.46 an hour and that I was going to be scheduled monday thru friday
bad,"Was an okay company to work for. Management needs to learn how to treat their employees. Lots of turnover at this store level. Management needs improvement overall. "
bad,"I have worked at this company in CO and N.C. They will hire you and change your position the first day, not train you on the position. Basically set you up for failure."
bad,Terrible place to work. Upper management would rarely assist department managers or employees. Store Manager was a pompous arrogant individual. No accountability there. It was almost a free for all. Way too many regulations to do job properly
bad,"By far my worst experience working.  I not a whole lot to say about working here, pay was really bad, all around a bad situation"
bad,This is a company that needs a overhaul of all upper management. The employees are some what lazy and not willing to do anything to help fellow employees. Found this out first hand working for this company. When needing help you can find the no working employees in the break room complaint about other employees. Do yourself a favor do not apply or work for this company. you will much happier somewhere else.
bad,"Responsible for pre-school aged children daily learning sessions, activities, and physical play time while at daycare."
bad,"I learned so much from working with Lowes, I enjoyed every bit of my experience at Lowes. Just helping customers with any problems they might have and make sure customers feel at home."
bad,"just a  all around bad place to work. i worked my hardest there, trained half the loading team, then i was let go for no reason besides it being slow. I was one of the best loaders they had . Dont apply here if you are looking for a permanent  job. they will cut you loose faster then you can blink."
bad,I was under the impression that my supervisor cared about our team. I was incorrect. The company terminated me while I was in the process of dealing with an extremely ill child.
bad,"Great place to work with very supportive management to guide you the right direction, Not all about the number, but how safe you work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside great team members and learning from them. Its a place where everyone learns each other by name and everyone is friendly."
bad,"HR is a joke, Management is a joke, no room for advancement,"
bad,"Great job experience! Horrible company management, I never want to work for this company again! Managers are lazy and don't handle business professionally."
bad,prepare to be used hard and under trained there are many expectations given. but you will never be able to accomplish them all because you will be all over the place
bad,"Staffing levels extremely poor, endless criticism for management, extreme lack of employee teamwork and moral. Very little monetary compensation for the hard physical work involved."
bad,"Running reports for stocking sales floor, printing pricing labels, review of sales and follow up for customer satisfaction and driving sales for the team and delivery help and back stocking.  I learned how challenging a home improvement retail chain can be with helping people with their special projects.  Management wasn't very helpful, and definitely didn't lead or provide example but we worked with what we had to know.  Co-workers were always great and very helpful, always over worked because of managements failure to provide operational tools.  Hardest part of this job was trying to help frustrated customers on weekends when they didn't want to be there or be working on special projects on their days off.  Most enjoyable part of this job was being face to face with people, employees and customers and figuring out solutions to tough problems and knowing parts and function of home improvement aspects."
bad,"Where do I start? Because of the horrible scheduling, I might go 3 or 4 days in a row without seeing my kids. The management was 50/50. Half were really trying to do some good while the other half were just stupid. DO NOT expect to be trained or promoted. You must beg and plead for any type of promotion and the store will hire from outside the store rather than build up the moral of the employees, which is very low. The pay is fair until you realize what you have to put up with. I worked in the Killeen, TX store and I will tell you that the store manager sits in his office doing nothing and has no clue what is going on in the store and ASM R is an idiot."
bad,Flexible hours. Great team members. Learned how to effectively multi-task. Supportive Management. Busy work environment.
bad,"This place has too much DRAMA. Promotions are only giving if your in the right click, I've applied to many only to be looked over and they hiring from the outside. Yes I'm well qualified for those promotions. Talking to management through their so-called open door policy is a huge joke. The favoritism runs so deep that others are GIVEN preferred job positions and others that are far more experienced are over looked. Because of this I'm on food stamps and rental assistance. Yes I'm looking for other job opportunities outside of this company, and will be gone as soon as something comes along. You are promised a certain amount of hours only to be cut from the schedule below your guaranteed hours at time of employment. I started working for this company with my eyes on a career but instead handed a job. Moral is the lowest I've seen in years due to the store management, I'm talking store manager to ASM's, most department managers are decent."
bad,they don't want to pay the employee's. basically they want to starve you. don't let a customer use your personal cell phone
bad,if u dont have any goals in life or have drive go for it. if you do you wont last that long as they really frown at that. company wants people they can mold.
bad,Dead End Job No work life balance. Pay is below standard. Over worked and underpaid. Mass layoff and poor benefits. Would not recommend
bad,"Terrible place to work. Managers are unapproachable, don't resolve issues. Too much politics and red tape. Care more about numbers than employees. Non supportive management."
bad,was crossed trained   in three different areas that I learned the hardest part and that management had no understanding and didn't really pull there weight and there was favoritism I enjoyed most of the customers and the coworkers that really cared about there job and that showed team work
bad,"Lack of everything...no management, no encouragement, not proud of working there at all. Always made to feel as though you haven't done enough"
bad,"I guess im not e retail person but this was my worst job by far. Lousy manager, lousy customers, lousy pay, lousy hours. Standing on my feet all day to only make 7.25 and hour is definitely not worth it"
bad,Management has lost all control of the store they're rude and very unfriendly to workers and customers which is reflected by the high turnover rate for the employees there most of Jerry Store manager is unfair and a bigot.
bad,oversaw the production of work on work sights. Owner mandated employees work in hazardous work environments (trenches) not properly built. OSHA sited owner after anonymous calls made for safety.
bad,"Lazy cashier management, not very good benefits for full time employees. Poor teaching, will not work with hours or negotiate."
bad,"Work/ life balance is not good. Flexible schedule really means we will cancel your work shift an hour before your due to show up. Management is lack luster. Advancement you will be waiting for a long time to come. Management is lackluster. If you get the job immediately start looking for another one, don't get comfortable."
bad,"I worked as a CSR part time in the tool dept. hours were all over the place, you might close one night and open the next. They have a lot of disgruntled employees who felt they weren't treated fairly. My dept manager worked for them for 11 years and had a really bad attitude and was pretty disrespectful of other employees. It didn't matter if you worked your butt off or just stood around like some of the help did. Very little training but you were expected to know everything. They have a lot of assistant managers that spend their time walking around in circles in the store and hated helping you or their customers. The store is filthy and disorganized and the customer base consists of thieves and drug addicts or just plain rude people. During busy times they hired outside help and took away hours from help that had been there for years. I've been in retail over twenty years and I've got to say this was the worst job I ever had."
bad,This is a easy job but it lacks structure and efficiency if you care about that type of thing. The pay sucks but its only four days a week so thats good!
bad,"the jobs are easy, but if you chose to stay quite and to yourself your told that you are being negative. If your not best friends with the supervisors then you are treated like dirt. and by best friends I mean going out after work for beers and dinner and stuff, also you will never move up in the company."
bad,"No challenge, slow, very boring. Upscale areas near the location on cypress wood, so tons of snobby rich people. Very hard to enjoy this place, always hot."
bad,"Horrible short shifts, rude managers and no form of benefits. The co-workers would be nice and interactive. The hardest part of the job would be long line within stressful situations."
bad,The managment is rude and takes you as a joke. They show favoritism and have their own cliques. Not considerate of your availibility.
bad,It was hard for mangers to stay on top of everything they weren't organized and you worked hard for no raises.ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
bad,"Bad work experience, managers do not abide by their word more do they recognize you for your hard work. Tons of unqualified workers are hired and adding to the bad experience."
bad,NJ company drove us from PA everyday in a cramped van for 3 months when we got to stay in PA they had issues with permits in PA and the phones did not work. And one by one they let us all go
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR LOWES if you are a grown up with bills to pay."
bad,"the people at lowes was nice people, management was not good though. also enjoyed being around the customers who came in daily"
bad,"Had the title of a manager, wirh no decision making power. Was expected and scheduled to work 50-55 hours a week and paid for 40. Was given vacation and sick time based on 40. No overtime. Salaried, exempt employee doing a clerks job."
bad,This company changes management every couple of months. The employees are not treated fairly and the managers are rude!
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's is extremely boring. Time just drags as you wait for 1 or 2 customers an hour. The management team think they are better than everyone else under them, and they are very unfriendly. The hardest part of the job is deciding to give a 2 weeks notice or not."
bad,I rather not comment on Lowes. this review will not be said at this time. there was no enjoyable part or good co=workers the hardest aprt of the job was trying not to leave.
bad,"management struggle to provide any structure for their employees, there ability to properly train staff was unsuccessful"
bad,"overworked for retail setting, nothing much did not learn anything new management was not very warming everyone there is for themselves coworker depends on who it was hardest part was adults acting like 17 year old"
bad,"The management is very unprofessional.  The shifts are open, close, mid. And they have you open then close the next day a lot. Co- workers are very friendly and hard working people. Worked in customer service counter. Was very busy and enjoyed providing excellent customer service to the customers. Hardest part of job was the lack of pay."
bad,Not a very good place to work. The scheduling was not great. You could work open one day and close the next or vice versa. There is a heavy work load on management. The only thing that is an advantage is that they pay you for your work load
bad,Hardest part is to get through non professional management. The process is really old and reviews are not about work you perform. I do not recommend someone to join this place.
bad,lowes is an ok place but then new management came and it kept becoming worst because management were more worried about keeping there jobs than anything else
bad,"I liked my time at Lowes but I didn't think they took me wanting to advace myself in their ranks, therefore I left. Co-workers are the only upside. Our management was awful."
bad,"standing on feet all the hours"
bad,"beware of baby faces acting like a dog , barking around and approved by those in charge ! , TOO MANY IMMATURE TEAM MEMBERS ACT LIKE A DOG ! BAD ATTITUDE AND VERY DISRESPECTFUL"
bad,There is no room to grow with this company management  plays favorites. Always refused to give breaks and stated it was a privilege for us to have one on an 7 hour shift. Head cashiers would often forget about the people the placed in outside garden or in lumber. Poor management all the way around
bad,"Very unorganized management, not all managers go by the same guide lines. Not enough cashier coverage, in the front end stressful."
bad,I work in a place where there was little to no management supervision. It was on many occasions a hostile work place. Customers are extremely demanding and feel a sense of entitlement.
bad,Place has no career advancement. They make their money off the backs of keeping people uneducated and underpaid. Managemennt creates a hierarchy environment. Years back company actually closed down stores across the country with as little as a days notice to the people that they were losing their jobs. Left 3 years ago and have not and will not ever step a foot back in that place. High school senoirs go to college and make something of yourself because you will not find it here.
bad,"NA "
bad,"not very much for what we have to do, I worked at several stores and nothing changes.co workers were awsome Mangaement did not care about there employees."
bad,"I worked for Lowes for 7 years and it was more of a nightmare then anything...the only good thing is benefits...management is chosen very poorly, favoritism is a huge concern, rules only apply when it suits someone  and its an all around bad experience...not to mention the store I worked at in Montoursville  is falling apart with a leaky roof heaters and air conditioners that work half the time and an unheated warehouse with a bird feces problem...very poor standards for a home improvement company...my personal suggestion...do not work for this company"
bad,"The company is quick to cut employees but not management.  Customers run over employees constantly.  Loss prevention is horrible, they wont follow up on anything being stolen from the store; employee is reprimanded for doing basic functions of job.  Overall belittling place to work."
bad,"If you're not sleeping or partying with management, you're not going anywhere. Management takes their time when responding to customer issues and no one is held accountable for their own work. If an employee doesn't do their assigned tasks, oh well, management serves no consequences and puts it off on another employee."
bad,It was a good place to work but took away from employees to save money. They expect you to work past your schedule. Always understaffed
bad,"Do not work here until upper management is gone.  Management treats everyone like trash, they constantly talk behind people's back.  Are always looking for a reason to fire someone, even if they have to make it up.  Forced people to do tasks that are OHSA violations with the guise of getting written up if task is not completed."
bad,Managers are not leadership material. Absolutely difficult to progress. Co-workers were great but they also experienced the difficulty with job progression.
bad,only left as was commission based doing door to door sales of loft insulation
bad,"This job is the worst.  Your hours are everywhere and long.  Your title is manager, but you have no authority over anyone in the store and they know it.  They do not listen to your requests for safety and procedural requirements  and store management does not back you up.  Your area manager will come down on you for your store being out of compliance even though you try your hardest to get store employees to help.  "
bad,"Work day started at 5am were I assisted in unloading product from trucks using sit down powered equipment. From then I worked close with the associate that overlooked the lumber dept. and provided any services he required while juggling between customer service, stocking, and general clean up. While I would like to say that I learned a lot from Lowes, my experience was a mixed bag. I did operate the sit down fork truck on a daily basis which was a piece of equipment I had only had minor experience with in previous jobs. What I walked away with from this job was that certain employees were given the right to perform their duties below par and the employees who showed a strong work ethic had to more often than not pick up their slack with very little recognition or payout.  I was never told the specifics of my job duties until I was there after working 7 months when corporate began visiting the store. Our store manager was well aware of how I was being utilized within the dept. But chose to continuously put me in positions were I had to tell half truths and sometimes bold faced lies to higher-ups in order for him to save face. I felt I had no choice put to play the fool for fear that I would be terminated by the store manager. My co-workers were also a mixed bag some had no problem engaging customers and interacting with people. Others felt that avoiding customers and hanging around other departments talking to the associates was a better use of their time. I witnessed several occasions where customers called employees for assistance and the employee walked the other way. Many"
bad,"I gave these guys all I had at first then became overwhelmingly agitated with how myself and my peers were treated. HR is a joke at lowes, manages are a joke at lowes and on a daily basis prove why the are lacking in leadership skills. There I no set up for training when moving to a new position or starting from a new hire. They are not concerned with personal troubles I.E. my divorce played a big part in me missing work and then the custody battle put me in a situation of having to pick up and drop off from school, causing me to have to leave work or show up late. on many occasions I asked for advice and was told nothing. I didn't have the help from family or friends that they suggested and just couldn't up and move like they implied ... the day after they let me go for showing up at 8:20 instead of 7am ( they were notified) I found a new residence where I wouldn't have to leave work .. they will call you family but when they are needed to show it, they are non- existent !!"
bad,"Very rude, horrible Mgt and most employees including Mgt are having relationships with co-workers and other Mgrs. Employees get fired weekly and it is all just under job performance. Worst HR in the business and the worst position and Company I have ever worked for."
bad,"The worst management I have ever seen!!!!"
bad,"They work you like a dog, never thank you for anything, tell you everyday that everyone sucks, they have taken away so many benefits that they used to give you. They will make you work 13 hours in one day because they have made promises to customers but at the end of the week they will cut your time so you do not get overtime,   ok so I help you out by working a 13 hour day to save your butt but you cut me at the end  of the week to again save you butt really ?????????"
bad,"Lowes as a company  is an ok place to work, but if you want to move up and you are not a favorite with the management, forget about moving.  There is no team effort at all, you are on your own.  If a fellow associate dosent do there job, you have to take up the slack and do there job, and your own. Don't complain, it wont get better, it will actually get much much worse. My   Department manager is a horrible person, physical threats, constant text messages on my days off about how I  have messed up the day before.  Physical threats like, if I could get away with it, id kick your a$#.  I wish I could punch you in the throat, just once.  Being belittled on the sales floor, like; You walk around in constant confusion, your ignorant, aren't you? Then being told, there is nothing you can do about me, I run this store, and the boss ( who will remain nameless) is afraid of me.  Then when you go to the higher ups, they make you write a statement, then do absolutely nothing about it.  Not saying all lowes are like this, but my store is. The most enjoyable part of my day at lowes, is clocking out and going home. The hardest part, clocking in every day to be tortured and nothing done about it. What I have learned from working at lowes, is that good people, that try to do the best job they can, will NEVER succeed here, you will only be treated worse and worse every day."
bad,typical day would be being told what to do like your a child. i learn to never work for lowes again management sucked real bad no help whats so ever co-works were just there for a pay check didnt know anything bout the work place hardest part bout to job was the rude employer cant say there was a enjoyable part bout the job
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's included following up on customer orders and completing installation and measurement orders. As well as, directing customers with which fabrics to choose for window treatments and color coordinating paint samples and colors. I learned a lot about different types of fabrics that create insulation and energy sufficiency. I also learned about paints with built in stain blockers and which paints were best to use in different conditions such a smoking, kitchens & bathrooms, as well as, which rollers would provide the best quality and longevity of the paint. As far as managements goes, management was pretty shallow, Often times not keeping up on the orders of products, so, a lot of time we would be out of popular merchandise for weeks. Management also had its picks and chooses of employees (favortism), leaving other employees to do there job as well as the job of other employees. They lacked cohesion and teamwork. The hardest part of the job was learning the system to complete the installed sales orders. I had to figure things out on my own because management was never around to train me properly. 90% of the time I was assisting in paint which was not my job title. I knew more about paint than I did in my area which was Home Decor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards for going 60 days accident free and seeing the smiles on the customers faces when they are satisfied with my services. Often times, customers would come back to visit me to tell me how wonderful the window treatments meshed with the paint colors I helped them choose."
bad,"The work hours were 70+ per week."
bad,"This location is run by employees, the lower level employees have all of the power. Management seems afraid to actually stand up for any decision made through policy. If any given employee complains there is no investigation the employees words are considered gospel."
bad,"The store I worked at was built only to give competition to Home Depot. This was a known fact to all of the employees. We were not educated on products but instead thrown to the wolves. I tried to help customers to the best of my abilities but when I was unable I was often called stupid and sworn at by the customers (grown men screaming at a small girl, imagine that). The management was cheerful and kind to us but that made no difference because we were all defeated by the end of the day. There was also no security and we advised not to step in. I recognized a crime circle happening within the store and was told only to document it as they walked past me with 100's of dollars of merchandise on a daily basis. It was infuriated to put on a smile when I knew these crooks were robbing us and I couldnt even call the police!"
bad,"Managers are worthless,hr and corporate is no better.i worked there and the managers play favorites, one cashier face times well on the clock in front of customers. another garden cashier had a b.b gun and was shooting the birds,when hr was told he didnt even get in truble"
bad,"Management is not really interested in training!  You are pretty much  ""thrown"" to the wolves without any level of true teamwork."
bad,Learned a lot of good skills here. Great employee relationships.
bad,"service desk answering phones, didn't learn much, management was horrible, and disrespectful, co-workers hated their jobs, hardest part was just being there, most enjoyable part was getting to know some of the customers who came in almost daily"
bad,"Very Top Heavy Company not much to say other than I still work here so I would rather not say anything negitive,"
bad,You literally stand around(waiting on customers) when the weather is bad outside.
bad,I'm more advanced than everybody on this side of the country and only get paid $8.00 and hour.  I have over 30 years in master construction.
bad,This company will not investigate anything that happens in the store itself. I had problems with a manager from day one and nothing was ever done about it. If you are not in a little group you just well forget about going any where in the business
bad,Lowe's is the worst job I have ever had. When i attempted to find other work my supervising manager would schedule mid day shifts that made it next to impossible to find another source of employment.
bad,"I really didn't like working for this company too much. They don't have a handle on their employees and yes, they are all adults and should know how to act, when certain managers are away, the customer service and work load shows. There is no sense of respect for one another in this company."
bad,"Although Lowe's increased their demands on those who got the job done regularly, they only offered advancement to a select few. After Applying for 15 different internal positions it became clear that since they could not find people to work every weekend I would never be anything more than a Wee Team Employee. It was time to look for something worth working towards"
bad,Worst job ever and would not work there again. The management only cared about the number and not the employees or the customers.
bad,"Answering calls"
bad,"This was a new store with very inexperienced management, which since has changed. "
bad,"This place has no room for growth if you are intelligent.  They promote idiots so management stays ""strong"" in their eyes"
bad,"mangers would let you have day off then write you up for it"
bad,Personally I don't like working at lowe's. But that's just me!
bad,"Loved everything about it"
bad,"‚Ä¢	Greeting and directing customers to the following isle they are searching"
bad,did not like it because I had to move very heavy lumber and I couldn't do that.
bad,Very nasty gross disgusting place to work/ shop! several expired meat packages/  meat products smelled nasty as well seen employes drop food and use it without washing! they would cover bad rotten smelling and looking food with sauces and seasonings! would re date expired products had baby mice in produce area as well as rotten products!
bad,Lowe's is the absolute worst company to work for. They are not family friendly by any means! Advancement is based on WHO you know and not WHAT you know. Managers treat their employees like dirt!!
bad,"You want NOTHING to do with this store or their management staff, unprofessional and biased!"
bad,"Lowe's of Portsmouth, the managers are horrible, and do not treat people with respect."
bad,say goodbye to your homelife. management is terrible. enjoy working until 10 at night when you close and you will have to close. don't expect to move in the company if you don't suck up to the manager.
bad,"No team work  and no help at all from the managers, you cannot have a normal life because of the hours."
bad,dont work there.  you will not be appreciated for the work you do.
bad,"Come in at 9:45, 15 minutes before my shift starts. See long lines at registers because, why? Well because we're short staffed. Clock in 5 minutes before my shift starts, and surprise surprise. I'm over at the Customer service desk because the person there needs a lunch break, totally okay with that because we need our lunches. The person manning the phones needs to go to lunch so I start to panic. Answering multiple phone calls, line is starting to form outside the door because no one else is there to help. I start calling for help no one comes for 15-20 minutes because we're busy. Managers were no help either. After enduring an hour of customers getting sassy with me, I'm left at the customer service desk because the person who was supposed to come back decided to switch places with me. I become very frustrated. "
bad,Not great management and treat employees poorly. Easy job though but not the best pay.
bad,"Lowe's sucks when I leave I will never look back. There hiring process makes no sense, worst job ever"
bad,"Extremely high stress, Physically impossible, VERY high employment turnover. Work lists that are physically dangerous, covering several departments at one time, while management tells you their 'expectations' , you are doing the work (alone) that it takes a team of 4 or 5 to do.... along with your primary duties and all the departments that have no one scheduled to work. Injuring your back doing what management tells you to do (woman lifting concrete planters) and being told/threatened  to let it go or you will lose your job."
bad,a day at lowes is cutting wood helping people and providing a good work place
bad,A typical day at work can be expected to be full of hassle as the store is unorganized and store managers do as little as possible to assist the situation.
bad,Don't expect to every be promoted unless your a favorite of the management. Doesn't matter how hard you work or your skills just who you know.
bad,its ok for me but i don't like it when they only cross-trained the same people over and over again. i did work with a lot of cool people but watch u must watch out for the people in the office they only lookout for themselves. they are worst when it comes to managing
bad,The Lowes on buckeystown pike is the worse place to work at.  They show a lot of favoritism. The cashier department manager is rude to her employees.
bad,An Awful place to work. Don't waste your time! They pay awful and treat their employees badly
bad,"Pay is awful, benefits aren't offered, management was a joke when I worked there."
bad,"my typical day is , I come in , suit up and go to my register. There isn't anything I can't do on that register in fact I can do anything on that register a customer calls in I can put the whole order on there including delivery , the  customer can pay ether on credit do half credit on one card and do some on another card if they chose to?"
bad,"First check was taken back in the second check in which the HR rep told me that that was correct, so worked for nothing the first two weeks. They change unload associate schedules constantly without giving proper amount of time. They expect for the unload associates to unload the truck in two hours, then turn around and put the freight up in another two hours after unloading the truck. If you are looking for at least 20 hours or more week, you would be better off finding another place to work. They create a hostile work environment toward the unload associates by threatening them with their jobs on the line. Be warned, if you should decide to apply for the position and get a call and the job, this is stuff you could expect. Also, it takes them forever to get back to let you know that you have the job, because when I was hired on, I found out that they sat on telling me for at least a couple of weeks or more. Also, you can expect other associates in other departments, expect you to do all their work for them as far as putting freight up, while they walk around. Also if they can, they will try to not let unload associates take adequate breaks. As the unload associate, you will be breaking your back and keeping the store stocked for customers, only to be treated poorly."
bad,"It may not be the entire company that sucked but the store that I worked at was terrible. People that i know that are currently employed at other stores say the same thing, so i don't know if it isn't the entire company."
bad,Management believes in minimum training in order to get max performance in job performance.
bad,"There are some great people that work at Lowe's on the Rim here in San Antonio, however the management is horrible.  They hire for positions without looking internally for qualified personnel, they are more interested in sell products than taking care of their people.  They take the customer is always right thing to a new extreme, and put their employees heads on the chopping block to save the customer.  One of the top five WORST places I have ever worked in my life."
bad,Driving truck to deliver supplies to customers. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is if loads were'nt pulled for me to load my truck and I had to take the time to go pull the loads myself. I enjoyed everyone I worked with got along with everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job was joking around with my co workers . I feel you got to have some fun at work work while getting the job done
bad,"Lowes always talks about putting the customer first. I was constantly  let down by management in the way they treated customers.  I always tried to make sure customers were cared for and one of the customers biggest complaints was that there were not enough people that cared about the customer.  Management would often turn their backs and walk away.  This company does NOT care about its employees.  Their system for clocking in and out is almost always acting up and you cant clock in on time. Then they write you up for being late.  They do not support their department managers and often upper management cannot get along themselves and everyone can see it.  Absolutely one of the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune of sharing my talent and time with.  When I expressed interest in moving up I was told ""Its a mans world""  I am a female.  Needless to say that it didnt set well with me.  I put in as much time and effort as any one of my male counterparts.  Offensive."
bad,It stinks that Lowe's has decided to cut hours for all part-time workers company wide. Their stated reason is payroll. The truth is Lowe's does not want to have any part-time employee with 30 hours per week because they will have to pay for health care coverage. Just another reason why part-time Lowe's employees are looking for jobs at other businesses. Part-time workers have been loyal to the company but the company is not loyal to the part-time workers.
bad,I sold a variety of appliances to customers on a daily basis.
bad,"the work you do is tedious and boring, managers want you to work faster and get paid less, everyone is part time just so they can save money and add on to their BIG bonuses. and god forbid you make a simple mistake because they will just let you go saying some nonsense about how this isnt personal its a business. one day they are praising you and taking your pictures and saying to all the other employees at the meetings that they will help you move up and go anywhere you want to go in the company. but make a mistake and its like they dont know you, like you just started working there. Dont trust any managers they are only after themselves in the end. backstabbers really, its disgusting what they get away with. cheap company that cant even fix equipment that the employees need to complete their job as efficiently as possible. To them if it can still be half used you better do full work and in a fast manner. anything to save money with this company."
bad,It was very fun working in a very busy enviroment because it made my day go by fast.  I enjoyed meeting new people every day.  I got along very well with my customers and co-workers.  I know they miss me because I think I made it fun at work every day.
bad,"I had a terrible boss, no promise of promotion even after a year of service, and treated terribly. Do not work here."
bad,"Didn't like my co workers"
bad,wasted 4 yrs of my life here and i wasnt allowed off the front end after years off busting my butt
bad,"No opportunity to acquire a permanent position with this company, which is not longer in business."
bad,They hired me with the understanding that I needed at least one weekend a month off to spend with my children and never gave it to me. The working conditions were horrible. The other staff members were not friendly at all.
bad,This place sucks. Putting up with cheating and a bunch of losers. and getting yelled at for no reason. DO NOT WORK THERE THEY WILL FIRE YOU FOR NO REASON.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Management at the store that I worked did not have the ability to work and understand other cultures.
bad,good staff but not enough info at interviews as i found out after a month it was comission work
bad,They do not like working around college students. They took away commission pay and did not raise hourly pay. make you work like a dog and dont care if your hurt. Would not recommend this place for employment.
bad,not enough hours in the day to complete the duties that were given each day. I believe I clean the rooms better then the workers who's been there for years.my work was over look while the bad work the did was accepted   
bad,This job was horrible. Drama between managers and coworkers. The managers there were the most unprofessional people I have ever worked for. Schedules were all over the place. Hired in as full time and barely got 20 hours a week. 
bad,"Lowes Canada 1/10"
bad,Don't even if you want to end up broke.THEY keep you below starvation level and management thinks its funny
bad,This job could have been a lot better but the management didnt want you helping customers they wanted you doing there jobs!!!
bad,"I desperately need to find a new job. Five years ago, I thought it was a decent place to work out, now I wouldn't even suggest my friends or family to shop or work there. Upper management is terrible and they have favorite employees over others and the customers are very rude there. "
bad,"I had work for Lowe's for over a year and they had always been bad.  The management team associates are lazy, and they just want to sit around or walk around.  Each team associates are really in it for themselves and there are no team work at all.  It seems like everyone takes their lunch around noon and each departments are pretty much deserted.  You can't find any associates to help customers.  The store manager stresses on customer services, and providing the best experience for each customers that walk in the door.  Well, Mr. Store Manager, if you have associates taking lunch all at once and each associates lacking initiates, then your store will go down the toilet.  "
bad,"the pay was awful, the management was horrible.  more worried about favoritism instead of work ethic.  always looking to fire someone for something stupid"
bad,very estressfull all nothing to learn about management did not know how to comunicate whit employes co workers cant talk to much about them there are not teem players trying to finish your job and dealing whit custermers at the same time the most enjoying part of the day whas going home at the end of shift 
bad,Unless your full time you have no say so in where you work.   Typically the full time employees just show up for work and do extremely little.   Part time employees can't advance to full time. Skin color and gender mean everything to store 1958.  Ineffective management of employees. 
bad,"Being the new guy the daily things would consist of working nothing but 5 to 10s getting stuck cleaning up everyones messes throughtout the day. Then youll work your butt off and see nothing but lazy people getting better payin jobs there, while you get nowhere. Management is okay but dont expect them to speak up for you or anyone else, the store I came from everyone was scared of the HR manager and what ever this HR wanted they got it wouldnt matter if someone was more qualified than others who applied whoever was there friend or who went and kissed their butt was the person who would get the job"
bad,Omg. This is nothing like they say. Honestly they treat the customer like god and the employee as the devil.
bad,"The management, the Store Manager, Assistant Managers, and the Human Resources Manager they are concentrating on only cutting hours, firing Full Timers and getting only Part-timers of FOUR hours shift. I have am employee of LOWES more than a year, and I have been applying for a FULL-TIME position, and they just don't give me an opportunity for a full-time position."
bad,no organization no structure terrible pay and benefits nobody want to do their job and wants you to do it for them
bad,I worked for Lowe's for a short period of time. It's an ok job if like to be tossed around like a ping pong. Management is not professional and their open door concept is false. If you have a problem with something or someone don't bother telling them cause they will shut the door in your face. I would not recommend anyone to work their you are just a number nothing more. Hours are awful they make you work 6 days straight and you work 9 hours with 1 hour lunch break.
bad,"Harassed by customers, employees & upper management because everyone is lazy & rude. Work 8-9 shifts only get if your lucky an 1 hr or 1/2 hr break because there's never any coverage written up if you have a minute over 40 hrs. Management only cares about employees who they party with or female employees who sleep with management get away with murder. Management will not deal with customers & if they have to, the associate is reamed out & written up for bogus reasons. Pay is not enough for the abuse & stress you're subjected to & the raises are laughable lucky if you get more than a nickel."
bad,"Management are idiots - treat people like children - management enjoys writing people up for ridiculous reasons and aggressively harass employees constantly. Hours are terrible - made that way to make it difficult to seek other job opportunities if you dislike your job at Lowe's and want to quit. Pay is awful - not equal to all that is expected out of you. No opportunity for meaningful advancement - unless you like a ""yes man"" to inept upper management and agreeing to their stupid decisions. I'd give this place no stars if possible - a total waste of time in a repressive work environment."
bad,Wonky hours... you could close one day and have to open the next. Getting off at 11pm and having to be back at 6am isn't great at all. Not knowing what your schedule is like makes planning anything worthless.
bad,"After 13 years of headaches I left. Company struggling to survive, management sold out on employees and wnt straight to the bank"
bad,I do not enjoy Lowes. Poor communication between management and employees.
bad,"If you enjoy working 3 days a week, at 3:00 am in the morning to on average past noon, doing extreme and very frequent lifting, sifting, and like having to stock everything with absolutely no help from Various Department staff. If you like to follow a ""Safety Procedure"" That Is Impossible to abide by, and then if Lowes feels like they want to take steps towards firing you, they go through hours of Receiving Video Survielance to find you doing a tiny safety violation, then pull you into the Backroom office and tell you you are on your final write up and tell you to act accordingly from then on out. It is by far the worst job I have ever experienced in my life. If one person calls in sick your day just went from manageable to the worst day of your life. If 2 people call in sick You might as well quit and go home. I worked at Lowes for 6 months, did countless hours of in store training, literally bled and sacrificed my overall health to ""Get the Job Done"" But it the end it was the facebook spying that irritated me the most, The boss wanted me gone because he didn't like the tone of a my posts on My facebook wall. So the went to work on making steps towards firing me, including the sabotage of my reputation with coworkers. I would never recommend this job to anybody. Las Vegas (Henderson) location 1033 ."
bad,"Working at lowes I learned so much. I learned how to multitask and work very quickly and effiently. I dealt with customers face to face along with on the phone and computer. It was a very good ecperience for me a customer service rep. I would handle all returns, exchanges and sales, along with dealing with installs and deliveries and also online orders and specail orders. I worked with my co workers and we all helped eachother to statisfy the customer completly. I learned alot of team work along with handle issues on my own and problem solving. The hardest part of my job was probably dealing with customer issues all day and fixing alot of peoples and sometimes department problems. As far as the best and most enjoyable part of my day was knowing I solved the issues for my company and of course the customer and kept solid customers coming back."
bad,"Does not matter how hard a worker you are, just how good you are at kissing rear-ends. If you are lucky enough to be one of the ""chosen"" ones by the magangers, you have it made. If not, too bad, so sad you will be gone soon because you will be tossed under the bus on a regular basis."
bad,"my typical day was racing across a mile in a half trek to the back of the large warehouse store to make sure to clock in on time and not get in trouble, then to be sent outside to be a cashier in garden in the freezing rain,wind, or blazing heat, barely getting a bathroom break after asking 5 or 6 times. My co-workers were very nice people, one of the few good things there. The management was atrocious, They were lazy, and rude, acted as though they did nothing wrong, played favorites with each other, and would put down employees if they did not like them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the horrible management making you feel as though you were a failure every day. I enjoyed the head of the garden dept. one of the nicest people to work there.. I hated the rest of the place."
bad,Lowe's upper management thrives on creating a culture of fear amongst its employees.
bad,Too many bosses not enough workers sums up Lowes
bad,"Poor management, poor co-workers, poor work-ethics. This is the worst company I've ever worked for. I worked very hard for a year and six months and got nowhere. I didn't get a raise, I didn't promoted, people lied about me and either though I kept working hard, a lot of people gave me trouble. Some of the management can be very sexist and very rude to male workers."
bad,this job was not that great i worked there for 4 and 1/2 years i started seasonal and got hired on but part time was there that long and 27 people were hired in full time after i had hired in. They don't care about hard work
bad,I was a outside loader even though I had more work history to be more. Was not hired for what I can really do. Only hired to be used.
bad,I worked at Lowes for over 7 mths and i was fired over the department phone while i was at the desk ordering something for a customer and i ended up crying in front of her. Then they refuse to give me seperation papers! They are not Business ethical at all nor do they follow the states laws and guidelines.
bad,The Lowes i worked for doesn't really care about their employees very much as an unloader the work load was very demanding with no breaks and no extra help when work load was backed up they really never cared if we working to hard or not just get the work done
bad,It was ok just stocking and helping down stocking shelfs and ordering lights and bulbs
bad,I would not recomend Lowes as a long term job for anyone between 18-26.
bad,Top store management has opportunities with holding associates accountable. Instead they lean harder on there higher production associates to produce more and turn a blind eye to lower production associates.
bad,"Lowe's has gone the way of major retaliers like Home Depot and Wal-mart. They hire part timers with low pay. All the best talent leaves for other better paying respectable jobs. A few smart people stay, but they are lazy or too old to leave. Many of the people promoted fawned managers with intense adulation. Our store manager W.W. was investigated for having an affair with an appliance specialist. The lady told everyone about it, and a coworker even took pictures of them together. Lowe's didn't fire him because it would have opened them up to litigation. He was the worst store manager I have ever had. It was apparent that he didn't care about the store or the employees. I resented a person making that much money sitting in his office playing on an I-Pad. He got the job because of a family connection. He never had to earn it the hard way. Seriously, there are people out there that would do 5 times a better job at half the pay. Most assistant managers were okay while some were great. There were many people loafing around not doing anything. The hard workers had to pick up the slack. They want submissive employees that do not have a mind. I kept my mouth shut for many months until I was screwed over too many times. I LEFT AND BECAME A MANAGER AT THEIR COMPETITION!!!"
bad,"Joke of a company. Upper management is a joke. In my experience I saw a bunch of egotistical uneducated fools in management roles. Lowes in Kingsport, TN - don't waste your time unless you fit the prototypical gopher type."
bad,What's a young persons idea of 'good pay' if it's $10 an hr. or even $12 NOBODY can live off that unless they're still living at home with mommy and daddy.
bad,I learn that I couldnt depend on that company for job security they hired you seasonal and in 2 months or less they tell you your times up they do not provide there employee with any benifits they just a down right slave drive. Alsot they tell you that you can reapply and Ive done the application over 5 times no call so I would not go back even if they payed me 2 dollars more.
bad,"Some bosses were nice but some wanted to get rid od all the full timers so they didn't have to pay full time insurance, and they rarley let you have a break or lunch. They do well at first but then they make us do it all on our own and not enough training."
bad,"I tried the best I could considering they had only a tempary Bakery, learned how to keep up with different lauguages I did not understand and how to work with many different people in a very small work space. No flexibility at all since I have children. I love to be around others and can work alone, enjoy working in the bakery, learned how to scan pictures to use on cakes and pastires"
bad,Worst eight years of my life! Upper Managemant LIES!!! Even when I left they said I would receive a severance package. Going on twenty five (thats 25) days still nothing. they promise the world and deliver NOTHING!
bad,Low paying on cdl drivers they hire u as a cdl & u all so work as a non cdl driver to they don't tell u that up front the non cdl drive make the same as you
bad,assisted cashier with money and customer service and returns taking customers complaints
bad,"Lowes is goin totally downhill. CSR is low, workforce moral is nonexistent, new policiy changes benefit corporate and not the laborforce on the ground. Management is the good'ol boy network, if you dont fit in their demographic cohort you can forget advancement. Even if you fit in management is so paranoid of good valueable employees due to fear of losing their jobs they will eventually get rid of you. This is an American company i was PROUD to represent. But i soon found out Lowes was about the bottom line, not customers, not employees and definately not the overall health of the name....LOWES."
bad,"I worked at Lowe's for 4 years without incident or any documentation or write ups. I was basically replaced by a ""bilingual"" cough cough associate that knew nothing and required far less pay than I, and for Lowe's the pay is not a liveable wage."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, bad pay, most management doesn't follow policy. irritating customers, Favoritism towards certain employees, covers each other and hangs others out to dry"
bad,"I worked here since April they only gave me 10 hours a wk. and they laid me off, so how are they hiring if they can't. give people hours, go to beards don't waste your time"
bad,typical day consisted of stocking shelves and assisting customers. management was not the best they would say one thing and do another. my co workers were very enjoyable and easy to work with. The hardest part was working with the management
bad,"On A typical day it was terrible.. The receiving team didnt get what we wanted to do the job, make it better, etc.. Management showed alot of lack of care towards us.. Overall I wouldnt Recommend anybody work there..."
bad,"Terrible atmosphere, retail is a drag, people don't care about what they do"
bad,You need to watch out they can 'pull the rug' out from under you. They closed a store I was at and come to find out they do not care about the employees. They will just let you go and no real chance of applying somewhere without going through the entire process of when you first get hired. I would not recommend this company even though they are on the 100 best places to work.
bad,Blame blame blame is their motto and watch out if your boss has made an error because as some point they will be passing the buck on to you
bad,"When things are busy they'll work you to death and when is slow they do anything they can to get rid of you including lying. Never trust what they say. And if you do get a job in the distribution center make sure you double check your pay checks. Myself and numerous other employees have noticed them adding hours to a ""shift differential "" catagory that should be over time. That's 11% more instead of time and a half. When you start everything appears great so mabye other DC's are but Rockford's RDC is a joke."
bad,I work hard. i feel that management is very poor timing is very poor as well need more time to get things done when there just one person working the department with a million and one things to do
bad,"Help customers find home improvement products, and ran and balanced cash drawer."
bad,"Like they say..My lowe's life. When you work at lowe's, do not expect to have a life. They expect you to do the most unrealistic tasks with no support besides working your!!! off. A manager a year ago was victim of racism and favortism at a metro-west store. He was let go when it was another manager's fault who made the same mistake a month later. They swept the matter under the rugs..The other manager is still working at Lowe's besides all his final write-ups. I guess because of his color. No job security! Favortism at its best!! Worse place to work at! They always have opportunities because they always getting rid of people if the store manager does not like your face. If you want to hate your life go work at Lowe's"
bad,"My typical day at lowes included cashier, customer service, helping load equipment and stocking the shelves."
bad,5 am t0 5 pm open shift
bad,They'll work you to death and then step over your dead body to sell a flashlight battery.
bad,Typical day... start @ 10:30 NOT ONE MINUTE EARLY or else you will be penalized..
bad,"I was originally hired as a seasonal store employee during the spring of 2010 but managed to keep a job after most of the seasonal employees were let go. I thought I was lucky for not being let go but I was very wrong. I went from working 40 hours a week to only getting 16. While I understand this is the nature of most retail chains it is huge problem for people with bills to pay who are unable to find employment elsewhere. While I enjoy helping people it should be pointed out that if you work in a department and are unfamiliar with their products you will spend the majority of your shift paging coworkers which can be a problem if somebody asks you a question about tools and there is nobody in the tool department. The worst part about the job is the management. While the store manager is very friendly and helpful the ASM's are extremely unprofessional and rude. What is most remarkable is the amount of disrespect shown by the ASM's to the cashiers. Fortunately I did not work as a cashier at Lowe's. Unfortunately, I had a manager who openly referred to me and other workers in my department as ""dead weight"". Needless to say Lowe's is a dead end job which is ideal for temporary employment but terrible if you are seeking any full time employment or a job that offers any kind of hope for promotion. If you are seeking a job with people who will treat you with dignity and respect look elsewhere."
bad,"They make you work up to 9 days in a row and don't pay any Overtime. You close the Store one night at 9 and 8 hours later, you are on duty again. No sitting allowed. Can you imagine on hard concrete all day long and the Store is so big it can't keep cool in the heat or warm in the Winter by the end of your shift you can't even walk to your car."
bad,I was made to do work that was not within my range of job description. My managers and coworkers verbally abused me on a daily basis.
bad,Enjoyed it at the beginning then the company changed and everything went downhill.
bad,A typical day would be helping customers
bad,Management is so customer Focused the work has no chance you can work hard enough for them and that is company wide.
bad,The company has a high turn over rate. I've learned much about the retail business here. My co-workers are great to work with.
bad,"a typical day leaves you overstressed and underpaid. management is not productive, does not help much aside from trying to appease the customers that are aggrivated by the poor service in order to keep the sales up. the corporate management is only concerned about sales and the bottom line. it is hard for women to advance in the company. as an installed sales coordinator you have to fix every issue that occurs when an unqualified low wage employee promises services not available or orders incorrectly. the image is presented to the consumer that the employees are skilled and that is not the case. bennefits are available to both full and part time employees, and there is an employee discount but that is the end of the list of ""pros""."
bad,"It got me through the economic slump. There is a great, loyal staff of workers in the trenches, though those in the Ivory Tower have little idea of the talent and ability and therefore the back-bone that has contributed significantly to the success of the company. I did learn to operate the software that is the necessary tool for the Kitchen and Bath Industry, and I am thankful that I had the chance to become a Kitchen and Bath Designer. I feel that I am under-employed, under-valued, and have grown beyond the limits of this company and want for myself to expand and grow."
bad,"Poor management and lack of team work. Lacks work/ life balance, lack of family values, no room for growth, and not a happy nor friendly environment."
bad,"Beware of seasonal full time employment. You will most likely find out seasonal full time is 10-39 hours, no set hours ,and minimum pay"
bad,"treat the workers like a number,middle and upper management never knew anything about the products in their department's."
bad,"Spent several years there, did almost everything in the store and practically breaking my back in the process, and as the years went on things got worse. Their illiterate upper management is NOT trained to know or do anything but crack the whip and treat good people like animals. I'm thinking these were the people that barely got by in school and now here they are!"
bad,"DON""T work here unless you are part of the Clique. Treat you like terrible"
bad,The Store in Lufkin Texas is the worst company to work for the upper mangerment ( store mgr Greg ) treat his staff bad even at his ASM to the hourly. He never close at all because he says he gets his asm to close for him all the time plus he yells at us when we are in a meeting with him. He makes all of us out of this store feel like we are bad at everything and he even makes fun of people with learning disability. Plus we had a asm out do to a back injury for weeks and he got so upset about the issue and took it all on all of us. Since this ASM came back and then we had a another ASM get hurt on the job do to a overhead door falling down on the right side of the body and because of this the ASM is out and all he dose is talk about trash about them when there out. To make the matter worst the HR manger does nothing about the wrong doing from him. Bottom line if you took this two out the store mgr and hr out it will be a great place to work the four ASM are the best at what they do . The company does not lets the upper manger enjoy family time like the ASM are there 50 plus hrs
bad,they dnt like to move up there employees no matter how hard you work.
bad,Worked for the company for four years in NH store-first two years was great until they changed upper management in the store and everything went downhill - the whole air of the store changed - people did not want to work together alot of anxiety- senior management in the store LAZY all they did was watch you on the Video tape surveilance and eat (take out food)and drink in the store manages office. They changed rules to suit themselves. The store has turned into nothing more than a revolving door of employees.
bad,"I have work at Lowe's for 13 years. They did away with two of my positions, just to save the company money, even though the position were needed.  They also want you to be available at any time. So you barely get to spend time with your family."
bad,"I‚Äôve been sexually harassed by an Asst Store Mgr, maligned by a store manager, and provoked by a dept supervisor. I was written up for things I was never trained in. Lowe‚Äôs has decent products like DeWalt, Smartcore flooring, and Pella Windows but they treat their frontline staff horribly."
bad,"I really wanted to like this job, but for the first week I did computer courses only even though no one would need more than two days to get the courses done. The 2nd day no one showed up to help me and other new employees with ‚Äútraining/orientation‚Äù. Then when I was actually put out on the floor to train in my department I wasn‚Äôt put with a trainer and  had no idea what to do or how to do things and for a few of my shifts there was only me in my department. No help no guidance no training"
bad,company pretends to care and offer job stability/growth but its all BS...late Or early from lunch beginning of END of shift by 5mins your given a point 12pts your fired
bad,Marvin Ellison is running this place into the ground. The not sure if he's simply incompetent or if he's going to inflate our stock and make a cash grab before we've tanked.
bad,I worked for this company for 6 years and let and degraded due to having my children. I was made to sign a contract to express and denied multiple promotions due to not hanging out with managers.
bad,"Store hours are being reduced, leaving minimal associates on the floor to help customers. The new schedule means you're on the floor nine hours instead of eight, often covering one or two other departments. No incentives, management is burnt out, associates are burnt out, just a depressing environment."
bad,There is a reason this company has a 95% turnover rate. People with experience get stuck in the same position and can't promote even with over 5 years of experience. Meanwhile people who apply off the street with no experience in the environment get hired on as assistant managers or managers. You will not get hired in to a department you know anything about. If you worked 10 years as a plumber they will put you in paint. It's that simple.
bad,The management does not care about the happiness of their employees or their customers as long as their numbers are being met and the CEO and other executives are making money.
bad,"So much work, stressful job. Poor management. No support or help to the management no proper trainings. No updates about promotions or mark down in the store. Lack of manpower all the time."
bad,Good old boys club...didn‚Äôt like you didn‚Äôt keep you! Didn‚Äôt have your back! Worked the good workers into the ground! Didn‚Äôt pay enough to get people in the door.
bad,"Simply put, the store where I work is a living nightmare due to the store manager. His management style is similar to that of a child; complaining, screaming at employees, and blaming others for problems he caused. Accountability and communication are nearly absent from the place due to mismanagement and the me-first culture that leadership cultivates. Benefits are good, but you will never be valued or compensated fairly for the amount of effort you put into your job here."
bad,I would give lowes 0 stars if it was an option. Too many managers and agendas and they can not comprehend that life happens from time to time. I just can't in good conscious recommend working at Lowes.
bad,I‚Äôve never been so unhappy with a company in my 15 years in retail. The management is disengaged and disconcerned. Their priorities are THEIR paycheck. End of statement.
bad,Management is bad a cashier's do whatever they want to do they hire family only they don't acknowledge customers they talk back they don't have and help with code 3 they don't thank you
bad,"Job was never clear on the specific duties. It was a new role that Lowe‚Äôs came up with and basically did HR and admin work, along with making sure the store is staffed and all other things. Had a young lady training 5 or 6 different stores and wasn‚Äôt getting paid squat. Horrible experience for her and myself. People were ok, management a little iffy. Don‚Äôt recommend this job or company to anyone."
bad,Lowe's doesn't pay what people are worth. Training is almost non existant. Sales people are thrown on the floor with little to no training and are expected to do their job. Freight flow is a major problem. Can't see Lowe's staying open in Canada for too long since they have been closing stores all across Canada for two years now.
bad,I do believe if you find the right store location it could be a better but for me it was abusive and I felt like I was working for the military. Upper management had no idea how implement and handle the on site construction experience. They put a lot of highly experienced design professionals through a lot of unnecessary negative situations.
bad,Not really the best company to work for to be honest.Lack of staff and hours around the holiday season and the management is just as worse terrible environment.
bad,"I worked for this company 24 years. The first 5 years were great then a new CEO took over and ruined it. I survived most of restructuring and downsizing until they targeted the most tenured managers. Now another CEO took over in 2018 and is destroying what is left of Lowe's. "
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had. When I started, the job was bearable but now with the many changes coming from corporate, the work culture has suffered. Job security is non-existent. Some departments are understaffed especially in the early morning and night while other departments have too much staff. "
bad,Pay was decent schedule was not hours were not the best makes it hard to have any time outside of work some days were better then others seems like things were passed off to the next person alot
bad,"Everyone's experience is probably different but for me while I've been here you get store managers that use their position to help their friends before people that have been their with years of experience. Management also doesn't listen to all their employees and take their thoughts into consideration. "
bad,"Bad management, poor training, misleading about positions, unqualified managers, not a safe environment, open door policy, but to no avail if you use it!"
bad,"There isn't much to say about this position as I only had it for 4 months. Soon after starting the position, I realized it was not what I was told it was going to be.  I was blessed to be hired by my current employer and am grateful for my new career as it took me out of this horrible job. There is not anything I could say positive, so I'm not going to go into the lengthy list of negatives."
bad,This place is the worst!  Will tell you one thing then say they didn‚Äôt say it. Management only looks out for management. Caught the manager in numerous lies. Terrible place to work. Get everything in writing before you start are they will change what they say. DISHONEST!!! They change the rules to suit themselves.
bad,I worked on the delivery team and just before I was trained in to drive I was riding with the driver who stopped by his house in the morning and got high. When brought to the attention of management they informed me that they couldn‚Äôt do anything based off my word.
bad,"One of the worst job I‚Äôve ever had in my life I feel like my manager was very racist one time she snatched something out of my hand , I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this job to no one worse job ever"
bad,The management in lacking in people skills. Making a profit is their only concern. They take employees and promote up the ladder when these people would not be hired in other companies.
bad,"The managers at Spring Hill Lowes lied to the full time cashiers about up coming change in our schedules, resulting in some days working 5 hours others 10."
bad,"Scheduling was always all over the place, Management drags their feet with employees and hardly works with them on important issues. Coworkers were the best part of this job."
bad,"Great place for people who like to be abbused or abbuse others.  Forget help from HR except for ratting you out to management for retaliation.  High turnover, I wonder why."
bad,Seasonal and part time employees at Lowe's were abused because of the lack of production of the full time employees. The management would not make the full time employees do they're jobs.
bad,Management changes caused lack of trust in company and lack of communication with employees felt like there was no one to talk to no in store hr schedule changed without notice management changes without notice lack of training and product knowledge training
bad,Went in for an interview for the Arnold Missouri Location. Was left waiting for a while for scheduled interview time. Was ignored when asked where the training center was. Given job description with no pay rates or work schedule posted. The ones guiding me through the interview were not enthusiastic. Very high turn over rate due to work schedule. Were not very professional. ex. i was sat given job detail paperwork then asked if i could perform all duties without given knowledge of how company policies even work. On top they said they reviewed my resume on Indeed. If they had they would've seen my availability would not work. Waste of time and money. Would only do this job if you are on the brink of homelessness.
bad,You have to have open availability and then you will be put on all evening shifts 1pm to 11pm. No overtime and 39 hours per week if you get full time. Part timers only receive 2 days a week sometime 0 hours. Cost of benefit are high and with a family they are unaffordable. They ask you to complete an overwhelming amount of task in a short amount of time while management does nothing. They also want you to beg the customers to give you a 10 on customer surveys
bad,"I was employed at Lowe‚Äôs several years and still not recognized by any of the management team"
bad,"Hired as part-time working full time hours. Was told I would be eligible for sales goal bonuses if they were given but were given to a select group. Same with advancement, only a select group were considered. After holidays hours cut for me yet remained unchanged for some. Yet when I did get scheduled, I was expected to pick up slack of those who were getting all of the hours. Also, rude and lazy management."
bad,"1. Severely understaffed, you pick up the slack.  "
bad,"There is no compassion for employees "
bad,"Cheer, Cheer, Cheer! Work, Work, Work! Make that money for corporate! And in the end they will remove your job so they can make even more!ü§¨"
bad,The morale at Lowe‚Äôs is terrible. The management is terrible. The only good part of this job is working with a friend going out on deliveries. Other than that this job is terrible and I‚Äôm constantly worried about losing my job because management threatens you
bad,"The pay isn't bad, but at the location I worked, management was awful. Someone wrote a racial slur on a form, and the person got a promotion.  They never listen to associates, and do not really seem to care about anyone. The pressure to sell warranties,  and generate remodel leads causes the people there to come to work with terrible attitudes."
bad,The only enjoyable thing about this place are your coworkers. Management is a joke that only care about making sales and not the overall well being of their employees because they never listen. Only 1 or 2 managers maybe 3 at most actually care about workers. Turnaround rate is high because of this and they wonder why. Pay isn't worth the amount of work you actually do in a day. Save yourself the headache.
bad,Management only cares about their work list and not their customers. Really sad! One manager is always hitting on the females. Really embarrassing place to work
bad,"Typical work day started at 5:30am and wouldn't finish till 6pm. Store manager and ops manager at the time constantly berated me for over time on myself as well as all drivers. Couldn't understand that drivers or myself could not control traffic conditions/weather or ease/difficulty of deliveries. Delivery routes were spread out between Manhattan (one delivery could take as long as 4 hrs. because of traffic with either 28ft box truck or flat bed tractor trailer), Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Bergen, Passaic, Putnam and lower Orange counties. All stores are sales driven with sales being the most important. Sales persons would tell customers anything to make the sales with full management approval. Delivery Dept. is service driven, never making a profit and because of that we were constantly under managements scrutiny. Store manager was transferred to three other stores where she forced out/fired most of her staff, ops manager was promoted to a regional manager. Talk about promoting to incompetence, this is a perfect example of it!!! Notified ops manager that a delivery couldn't be made because of the houses layout, her answer to me was ""Either make the delivery, or don't come back to work after Christmas!"" Did my best to make the delivery with the homeowners help. Ended up getting hurt on the job with a severe lower back injury that has required surgery with NO relief in pain and permanent nerve damage in my right leg and lower back."
bad,If you don't mind being lied on stabbed in the back set up for failure it's the perfect place to work at. When you try to advance if you're not in the manager's Inner Circle you will not go far. The training is done by computer with no human interaction at all. They are always hiring someone new and turning around cutting your hours
bad,"Low pay, you can‚Äôt survive on it. Staff means well but the store is rebuilding the management team. It‚Äôs going to be awhile before it thrives again. First job seekers it would be ok."
bad,"poor mgt , bad working hours ,unfrendly staff            bad working conditionn             unfrendly staff                   poor hours             bad managment"
bad,The head cashier who wrote the schedule was always changing it but wouldnt tell you she would. You cannot go 10ft from your register and shouldnt talk to anyone else working. Never a constent work schedule and it was always changing. I would get yelled at for the smallest things and did not feel valued.  I had to take emergency family leave and i got a call every day asking where i was and i had to explain I was out of state. No communication at all
bad,The Company is run by people with little or no interest in it's employees. O early regulated and extremley inefficient in how it maintains inventory. Management is all about how to assign blame on anyone but themselves. The CEO has a track record of gutting companies to provide short term gain for stock holders.
bad,"did not give you the time to do your work, and complained when you didn't get your work done. Had you deal with customer complaints so they didn't  have too"
bad,"To much drama for me. No one is happy , very depressing place to work."
bad,Not really a whole lot to say about a place that doesn‚Äôt really show they want to help employees with problems they may have once a while. Do NOT recommend it.
bad,Lowes company is making changes and moving eployees around ..i was off medical came back put back into department w 2 other specialist couldnt make my sales and was told i should have been put in a department where o was needed.  I couldnt make sales because of competition so i was written up and demoted
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is an easy job, but they intend on scooping people up from the bottom of the barrel. There is no structured management, so anytime you try and bring up issues, they will either dismiss it or pass it on to someone else, to be dismissed. They harp on the hardest workers, and let the lazy employees get away with what they want, and then reward them."
bad,Lowes is way under staffed from what it used to be since the new ceo took over he has reduced the amount of associates to a point where there is barely enough associated to help customer let alone keep up the stores appearance. And still expect all of the work to be done in the same amount of time as of we had proper staffing.
bad,"Store Management is awful (with exception to a few) "
bad,Management sucks always changing very unorganized.  Management needs more training.  They lie on their employees they are incompetent.  Should close store
bad,They show no concern for their employees. Training is minimum. Unrealistic expectations to sell extended protection plans and push hard for CC applications. Will get rid of you if you don‚Äôt meet those expectations. Favoritisms are out in the open and nothing is said.
bad,"Nobody is safe when it comes to being spontaneously terminated at Lowe‚Äôs. They‚Äôve fired workers very close to retirement with no warning to be replaced by a third party company. "
bad,"It was my first time working,it was ok I learned a lot they showed me how to be independent working showing up at a early time.I got my high school diploma from school of gna."
bad,"Discriminatory and hostile working environment due to lower management. Labor was divided unequally and different expectations applied for different workers who were suppose to be responsible for the same job. Also, there was constant harassment from immediate managers."
bad,"This company is very cliquish. If you not with the ""in"" crowd, you have no chance for advancement.  For the people they like, if you do not preform well in on area, they will promote you and put you in charge of another department."
bad,"Uses a matrix. One weekend a month off, max. Erratic schedules make an outside life impossible. Chronic understaffing and extremely high workload for barely over minimum wage. No advancement based on time/experience. You are a CSA until YOU apply for and interview for a different job. Absenses are cumulative, never excused, and held against you."
bad,Was a good place before the new CEO took over now wages decreased lay offs hiring third party letting employees go same day without warning. No severance. Low moral and everyone wondering am I next?
bad,"Ever since 2017, this place is going ""somewhere"" in a handbasket. Everyone with experience or knowledge is finding a job somewhere else because they do not value experience or tenure they are just trying to cut payroll and be like depot."
bad,"Working at Lowes is like going to college for free, but with no books or professors... Not a single formal introduction from the management team. Zero organization and zero teamwork. Maybe it was just my location, I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt. Continued to recieve no help after asking around on how to transfer locations. A month after my start about 15 employees got let go with a SINGLE day notice. Don't bother applying here."
bad,Best decision that I made was to leave.  Hours/schedule were all over the board.  Hard to maintain a work/life balance.  No clear direction from managers on what to do.
bad,Well it use to be a great place to work for. But the changes that they are doing .and the low employee staff . And the lack of hiring experience ppl .NOT A PLACE YOU CAN RETIRE..
bad,"Turn away from this company, full of empty promises of continued employment, benefits, and bonuses. Been there 8 months and saw none of that. Management is non existent, lay offs are picking up. Don't waste your time on this dying company. Seriously."
bad,"Lowes require managers to be available morning, noon, and night. Every failure is due to management, Managers are assumed to be fully trained, but No true training is provided. Lowes talk a lot about accountability for associates, when in  reality, if you become that manager that holds associates accountable. They will side with the associates against you to save their own butts. even after giving orders to carry out a task that is not going to be favorable for you. Like Attendance violations, Department Conditions, Poor Customer Service etc. This company talks of family, but looks down on you when your wanting time with yours as a leader."
bad,People were afraid they'd lose their job everyday.  Unhappy staff management wise and sales people wise.  Schedules were changed without warning and without telling people so shifts were covered routinely.
bad,"I would not recommend working at Lowe‚Äôs. Had a corporate job that after a year Lowe‚Äôs did away with. Unlike many people, I was able to transition to another job at Lowe‚Äôs, and three month later they did away with that job also. What a mess !"
bad,"There are a few nice people in the whole store "
bad,"Up until 2 years ago the company and my store went downhill. The new direction is to go downhill and there's no slowing down. I would say unless you're brown nosing, there's no real career here and you're gonna be stuck in the same position. Good luck."
bad,"My time at Lowes started fine but eventually went down hill fast. Employees are miserable at this store. Good workers quit due to irresponsible,selfish,lying,and lazy managers. Managers favor the laziest of managers, and employees while the rest suffer. One manager has been moved several times due to his behavior. Several good associates have left because of this person."
bad,"Store is not managed well, bad communication, would be wonderful to work at if not for these issues. Would not recommend working there unless it were completely necessary"
bad,"I enjoyed co-workers and the work (lumber/building materials). The hours were rigid and management would not change the schedule. Had to be promoted for schedule change. Pay is good for a first job, but raises are below cost of living. Under staffed constantly. Managers are lacking in leadership skills/training."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Your job security is ""0"" They require so much of you and if you make 1 mistake you are out the door. In the time I was at Lowes I saw hundreds come and go."
bad,Lowe‚Äôs treats their employees terrible. They actually don‚Äôt care about their employees. It is cheaper to let you go and replace you with a teenager who they can pay 10.00 a hour. The manager in charge of the cashiers is rude and down right nasty if you are not in her click. Stay away if you can. Home Depot treats their employees so much better. Go orange. A typical day is being asked to perform three different jobs.
bad,"At lowes,  there is alot of favoritism going on. I dont care how much experience you got, if you're not apart of the click, no managerial position for you. Managers are also taught to not work. They would walk around the store with papers in their hands and delicate tasks all day. If you're the only person in your department,  management will have you running back and forth without helping you. Company will work you to death"
bad,"Horrible management, constantly understaffed, applied for one department but I always ended up spending entire shifts in the lumber department, an absolutely horrendous schedule often leading to 10+ day work ""weeks"" and opening shifts immediately following closing shifts, management often sent out new hires without any additional training besides corporate videos. Management is more concerned with how good the store looks instead of how well it functions, leading to dysfunctional departments. Find somewhere else to work"
bad,"Poor management, the ceo is running the company into the ground. They dont care about your personal life, or your work life. 55hrs this week due to poor planning? Oh well."
bad,"No matter what you do, it is never enough for management. I was actually benefiting from one of my managers and she thought so highly of me because i spent most of my free time working overtime to help out. after i stopped overexerting myself, management started to treat me like garbage until they found an excuse to place me in a different position which no longer had a set schedule. I worked real hard to make up for starting off as a bad employee but the expectations are unreachable. They claim to have an open door policy but it results in nothing. My store manager tells us that there is only one truth at lowes and that is his truth"
bad,"this is by far the worst experience I have had in the working industry that i have been in for 45 years. absolute collapse of first level management. there is none. an utter complete hostile environment that the upper management seems responsible for in my opinion. Lack of leadership and accountability. I still work there, at this moment. I may have simply had enough"
bad,They don't care about their employees all they care about is if they have a body in the position. They have no accountability employees do what they want and all the older employees do all the work
bad,"Worked there for 2 years horrible horrible management, very prejudice employees and customers. The only saving grace is the pay and certain employees you enjoy, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone who don‚Äôt want to get cut dry from a job due to terrible, rude, off putting and political management."
bad,Worked 40 to 50 hours a week busted our butts doing deliveries found out beginning of June we no longer had jobs at the end of June due to third party vendor
bad,The management is ridiculous. They expect way to much for the time they give you. Even the veteran workers say that it has gotten bad. Promoting from within is a joke. Sales specialists have it extra bad.
bad,"I would not work at the Lowe's I worked at ever again. I worked there as a second summer job. They were always understaffed and the management was terrible. First off they got my federal paperwork messed up and took two months to get fixed. The whole time working there as a cashier I always had a training badge even though ""training"" took at least two-three days, but I worked there all summer. The customers were always mad because of how understaffed we were at all times. They forced me to work in other customer service areas without proper training. Overall, I hated working at Lowes and would not work there again."
bad,"Recently had a confrontation with an ASM.  I had been able  to block Sunday am to attend church with my daughter.  For some reason, that is no longer available, even though it was permitted for the past 4+ years, and no reason was given to me for the change!"
bad,"Don't expect a ""family"" environment like Lowes claims it has. People there gossip and stab you in the back. Management condones laziness and doesnt care for hardworkers. If they dont like you, you'll know by the lack of communication and shortened hours. I still didnt mind working there but managemnt never ever stepped up when we needed them most, especially when they hire kids who dont respect anyone or anything."
bad,"Was a good sales job when they paid bonuses and commission,bit they took that all away without warning....That was the only thing that made working horrible hours and weekends worthwhile......no commission took the wind out of everyone's sails"
bad,"STAY AWAY FEOM THE OXFORD, AL LOCATION (store 0698) "
bad,"I worked at 2 different stores, most recently in Victoria, Texas. I really enjoyed this company when I first started with them; however, the last couple of years it has changed entirely. You‚Äôre constantly being pulled around to do everything except what you actually get paid to do, and then get held accountable for not getting your own work done. By the end, I‚Äôd say I spent about 10% of my time on the clock doing my actual job. Getting promoted is a popularity contest, not based on actual skill or knowledge. Accountability was a popularity contest as well; I watched over and over again as butt-kissers flew right under the radar, while good, hardworking employees either got ran out or fired because they refused to suck up. Maybe it‚Äôs not so bad in other places, I don‚Äôt know... but unless you want to die early of stress, I would not recommend working at the Victoria Lowe‚Äôs."
bad,"I was a former Department Manager in Electrical for the Maple store.  I was appreciated by the customers for my knowledge of Electrical and ability to troubleshoot their issues and come up with solutions for various problems as this was the field I had worked in previously and following.  Management showed little understanding though I followed rules and regulations to the letter.  There practice is to flood the department with students and staff that are unqualified and hold you accountable for their lack of committment, tardiness and lack of respect for customers or staff alike.  As I was a professional in my field I was used from the beginning to establish a good relationship in the community as having people who are knowledgeable.  My self and the Lumber Manager were set up and released for managers they felt were more suitable though they had little to no undrrstanding of the technical or professional needs of a specialty department.  Rate of pay was not reflective of experience, work environment was high stress and there was little to no support when needed."
bad,"Between poor management, poor scheduling, and poor communication this place is terrible. If you want to advance be sure to be in good with certain managers and cliques of employees. Truly a toxic environment. Certain managers tell one thing and another will tell you it‚Äôs wrong. Policy is literally a guideline. Quite a few employees call out habitually but still manage to keep a job due to management constantly making excuses and covering for them. Don‚Äôt waste your time. Also they seem to forget/ignore when you have a school schedule or military orders."
bad,"Was not trained on how to do my job, mangers and  supervisors just complain to you, employees are extremely disrespectful, got yelled at for literally doing my job."
bad,"Worked night shift unloader, Some good people who left due to managements lack of oversite.  Lost two forklift drivers in a matter of a month and waited to train a new one till the last week of the last forlift driver leaving.  Watched as the new driver ran into the truck wall mulitiple times and drove to fast around others.   Yet still gave him his permit.   Kept people who worked at half speed of everyone else."
bad,Management team didn‚Äôt have a clue what was going on. They went thru them so quick they could never learn their job and than went to a new role. Being in delivery we were treated like a red head step child.
bad,I started as a seasonal associate and this one mgr is biased and would give me a hard time you can‚Äôt change availability and the mgr would make people feel low  you can‚Äôt get a second job because you will get fired
bad,"No one wants to work this position or stay in it. Its terrible they work you to the bone. Force you to work over time. You don't get to go home when you're supposed to. Expect 10 - 12 hour days every day, sun up to sun down. And the worst part that they don't tell in the job posting is you're delivering and installing appliance into people homes. Huge heavy refrigerators you're lifting up flights of stairs. Disgusting house stink of animal urine and feces, roaches every where, hoarders, etc.. you have to haul away grease covered stoves and rotting meat broke down freezers. management has 0 empathy for you they just tell you to make it happen."
bad,"This is when you work until 10 or 11PM and are scheduled to return to work the next morning at 5:30 or 6:00.  Yes, we climb ladders, lift heavy items, work around sharp and dangerous shelving and items, work and drive power equipment, all while on little rest. Sounds dangerous, right? Lowe's doesn't care. "
bad,Corporate wants low hours but 100% customer reviews. You are a number and not a person to them. The management changed constantly I work two stores in eight years and had four store managers and well over 12 assistant store managers.
bad,Overall company is loosing its individuality and becoming more like home depot. No longer a fun place to work. Company would rather hire externally the to promote from within
bad,At my current store location I honestly don't feel as if my work performance is appreciated. It's a stressful work environment that truly doesn't embrace it's dedicated hard workers.
bad,Company hires a lot of family and friends so they usually get the job. They don‚Äôt really offer full time. Employees are very friendly and helpful. The management there needs to be observed more and without prior contact
bad,Drama from top down.Hypocritical workplace.Bad company period.Save yourself from a very dysfunctional and unprofessional environment. Store Management very weak.
bad,"Poor management , no work life balance; they give you no support  or advancement opportunities. Pay is ok at most. "
bad,"This place is an absolute JOKE. Long hours, stupid shifts, management had NO IDEA what they were doing. You'd get scheduled 7 days in a row and get one day off, or they'd completely ignore the availability you gave them. Also, the availability requires here were INSANE. If you want more than 10 hours a week, you better have open availability."
bad,"Management sucked, hours sucked and all of the other people working there besides a handful sucked as well. Great pay for doing nothing at all but will make you feel miserable going in everyday."
bad,"I had zero training. I had to figure out most of the job on my own. The managers were more concerned with internet sales, than checking into their department. Good luck trying to get hours. The only time they gave me hours is when I got a second job. Then they tried to over lap my hours so I couldn‚Äôt work my second job after I had a lengthy discussion with the manager about my availability. "
bad,"I have NOTHING GOOD to say. I am glad I have moved on. Management is completely clueless, and they expect one employee to do the job for the entire store, HIRE MORE PEOPLE who know what they are doing. Overall toxic workplace. No thanks,"
bad,They hire part time to avoid paying benefits  of any kind then they work you to the max hours allowed.  Part time means no rights. They don't  care about how your schedule works.  It would be nice if they gave you the hours you wanted.  Students want evenings and weekends  so why put family people or older people  into those spots ?  They have really old computer systems.  Trust no one.  Lots of cliques and gossip.   Nothing genuine here.  Not a good place unless you are the boss over others.      Don't  waste your time.  Worst job I  ever had.
bad,Job was a joke. I wouldn't recommend the job I held let alone the company. It should just die off. Its old and out of date on programs and way of doing things. Don't bother.
bad,"Plumbing Pro solving customers issues and resolving them. How to deal with different customer, retail is much different than Industrial Sales. Very poor, not very helpful. workplace culture was great met some great co-workers and had fun at times. Hardest part of the job, was early morning starts, and unruly customers. Interaction wiy other departments."
bad,Just told a bunch of lies and the manager would always put my down and target me outta everyone else on my team.. I tried telling a manager but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I quit and I plan never to come back or anything..
bad,"Managers don't care about the staff and have no time to speak to you."
bad,"New people are always willing to learn, more seasoned people think they know it all and never get reprimanded. All Lowes cares about is sales, not good customer service. Everybody pushes off their work on someone else"
bad,"Management is a revolving door of incompetance from the ""special manager""  level to the CEO.  Saratoga Springs in particular is the absolute worst.  Not one single employee in this store holds a contractor license.  Anyone with any clue about building code or construction is fired in favor of cheap inexperienced labor.  Five years at the same position with 14 interviews to move up with every opportunity came any excuse they could find.  With a centralized HR, now there is no limit to employment laws being broken.  Work here if you must, dont plan on staying long enough to get anywhere within the company.  Waste of time unless you are already part of the current management clique.  Some employees have turned to backbiting in order to become part of protected clique."
bad,"Worst employment in my career. Management from CEO down to store level is unfair, dishonest, self serving and unprofessional. Employees are not viewed as having any importance."
bad,Lack of communication. No opportunity for advancement unless your in the CLUB. Hours cut regularly so the high ups can get their bonuses.  They do not care about anyone below management. People that deserve the jobs more qualified and have worked hard do not get the promotions. The store pets do.
bad,"Management treats employees like they are expandable. They hire out of company while promising current employees job positions of higher pay. They do not acknowledge hard work, as soon as you stop going out of your way to go above and beyond your job description they tell you you need to improve. They discriminate against people with mental health issues such as anxiety. If you are prone to panic attacks this is not the place to work, I had one and the manager on duty told me he was not sympathetic to that. I as left on the register and had to have another employee take over so I could try to calm down. The only good thing about working here was the other employees. If you get a full time position just know that they will try to work you at 39 hours or less to cheat you out of benefits."
bad,"The corporate site follows it's retail setting and  there are very few benefits for working at a corporate site for this large company. For instance, the traffic is terrible and there is no telecommute policy. You only have 2 holidays. Your vacation does not increase until you work for the company for 15 years."
bad,"Terrible management in the West Columbia, SC.  I wanted to move into a more - career friendly sales position within other departments and I felt that I was deliberately overlooked because they always had a hard time keeping workers for the Unloader position"
bad,"I loved my job at Lowes. I worked in the garden center for almost 3 years. Management restructured and everything went haywire. People were getting fired, or laid off left and right.We became so understaffed that it was impossible for us to do our jobs sufficiently. Management was NEVER out in the garden center because it was either too HOT or too COLD. We dwindled down to 2 people a day and 1 person at night...until 11:00 by themselves. I am a 51 year old woman, 102 lbs., yes, I worked by myself, lifting, loading, cleaning, etc...until 11pm. UNACCEPTABLE!!!"
bad,"Many managers who work in a zone type setting, most have no clue how to manage and interact with others.  Like the rest of the workers they have no or little prior knowledge of the products and how they are used.  On your feet on hard concrete all day.   Half of all new hires quit within 60 days, wow."
bad,"So it's better than Walmart, but there is minimal in the way of a work/life balance. Minimal advancement for growth. Managers don't care about employees, you're basically just a lifeless body to fill a perceived need so they can avoid leaving their offices and interacting with customers."
bad,Well the management really don't know how to run the place . All they care about is there bonus and how they can get rid of employees to save there budget.they don't care about there employees like they say they do. they lie to you about certain thing or do tell you about till you question it .some management have power trips and think they run the whole company.
bad,"Weak management and zero support. Some mangers micro manage to the point of being a hindrance. Sexual harassment/bullying by managers is acceptable. If you report the incidents, they are swept under the rug and a larger target is drawn on your back. "
bad,"don't waste your time "
bad,"My advice to applicants is to move on. Don't waste your time trying to work at Lowe's. You will be disappointed."
bad,"A company that promotes and screams teamwork, unity, trust, loyalty. There was none of that in the Nisky lowes (store 1612).  Senior management, and store manager only care for themselves.  They give little or no support or feeling that we are in this together.  Mostly just barking orders, running what little loyal/good employees they have to the ground.  There is a difference in being a leader and being a manager.  That store will not turn around, or be a good place to work until it is literally whitewashed of the ASM's and store manager.  No one wants to attempt to move up because of how they are, how quickly they will turn their back to you and throw everyone under the bus.  What employees that are currently there continue to grow a bigger chip on their shoulders, and would walk out the door in a heart beat for another offer.  No loyalty, NO LEADERSHIP."
bad,It was a lot of issues dealing with the managers and a lot of favoritism. good place to work part-time but not full-time. Hard to  move up unless your one of the favorites.
bad,Management and co workers were not cohesive to a good work environment. To take paid time was rarely approved even if asked a month in advance. Innerstore politics created a work environment that lead to constant stress and anxiety.
bad,work there again no thanks to many problems with in management staff  the only good thing was clocking out  and going home to where smart people were thanks but no thanks
bad,"Was an associate was not allowed to move up in company "
bad,Lowes in my opinion does not value their employees the way they should. I worked there for 13 years they did a restructure and us seasoned employees never had a chance.
bad,"It's a very fast paced job, where your performance is based on numbers. It's a physically demanding job."
bad,I worked with racist people who when reported suffered no consequences. Certain managers treated me and my coworkers with little to no respect in one on one encounters. I do not recommend this job to people with morals.
bad,"This company totally sucks.  They have not honor and will fire you at the drop of a hat, then contest it!   Schedule is horrible, pay is bad. Management is horrible."
bad,"As a Temporary, part time employee, I received absolutely no benefits, no sick days and no security with my class schedule. Temporary employees are also expected to work longer, more difficult hours than full time employees with a far lower rate of pay."
bad,"Coming from a similar job with lots of structure, I would see things that needed to be done in my area and do them, and others came to work for the social life.  Rules were broke to satisfy contractors because as long as contractors were bringing in the money, they didn‚Äôt care if anything else got done.  Shelves could sit empty as far as they were concerned.  Other customers, lower paying, couldn‚Äôt always get what they wanted, or had to wait in a long line because of no cashiers, as long as the elite got their service.  Management team is part of the social life, rather than setting an example"
bad,"Lowes is not a fair place of employment. they do not treat everyone the same and the managers go off of favoritism, not work ethic!! They will fire hard workers to keep the ones they like even though the ones they like are lazy and never show up on time. The managers will never take your side over the customer even though the customer is in the wrong and you are telling the truth and have witnesses to prove it. The company is a joke and its management is full of high school drama that no one wants! Overall, i would stay away from working for this company unless you enjoy a very stressful job where you have to suck up to all management or you get fired!"
bad,Poorly managed company where the favorites are more appreciated than the hard workers. Never gave employees the support or training they need to advance their career with the company.
bad,"This place is no where anyone who wants a good life and pay should work. They can care less about your needs and more about the sales of items that aren‚Äôt even in the store. If you‚Äôre not a salesman you‚Äôll get treated poorly and be asked to do other people‚Äôs jobs although yours is not complete. They truly cut into your personal life and doesn‚Äôt work with you with your schedule. One moment you‚Äôre applying for one position during the day you prefer. The next moment you‚Äôre in there doing 3 departments, trash pay and benefits, and then they expect you to do it alone before your shift is up with low staff. Managers talk and socialize more than any of the people they employed then complain when someone takes a break that we‚Äôre entitled to because now it‚Äôs nobody in the department and they have to handle it. More than half the employees is there to get a check and run out the door immediately after their shift is up or earlier. Nobody does their job 100%. Avoid working here."
bad,"When I first Joined Lowes in Canada great Culture, great Managers at Store Level < great opportunities for growth. Than moved back to the USA, got hired since I came with great references, within a few years noticed the Culture change for the worse, Manager retention at the lowest. Corporate decide to dissolve my position for this reason I left the Company."
bad,It was the worst of my employment experiences while overcoming many disgruntled employees many who quit unannounced during the years that I worked for Lowes.  It's good for H.S. and College students seeking temporary employment.
bad,"On a typical work day I would go in and start with printing section reports and then file them. Then when the trucks came in, I would unload and start the process of the receiving the product into the system to be added to the shelves.  Upon completion of this after several hours i would begin to work on the installs which would be with various companies that worked with Lowes. If my bay area needed cleaned I would do that and help other associates who needed it or whatever else needed done."
bad,"Very poor management, no one liked to do their job, severely underpaid but was expected to perform like you were getting 50 dollars an hour, they dont do anything to keep their employees so the people who do work there are pretty much punished because they cant hold on to people and they are expected to pick up the slack."
bad,"While working at Lowes, it mandatory to accept bulling and verbal abuse by customers.  Management was a joke only cared about how much money was spent or if you sold and extended warranty or signed a customer up for credit card.  The assistant managers would yell at you from across the floor and humiliate you in front of other customers and employees.  They have a large turn around with employees and most of them hate the management but need the income."
bad,Very disorganized and unsafe place to work.   Generators and heavy grills are placed over 6 feets  height on loose freight. One or two unloaders on 900  plus peaces over the weekends.  6 guys on 400 peaces truck the weekdays..  It Takes 2 hrs every day to clean after day crew and sale specialists so I can get to the receiving dock.  just a complete mess and the management don't wanna and not willing to fix it.   Had to quit before Getting hurt.    Just not worth it for less then 12$ hr.    Stay away from this place.
bad,"My Opinion, It was one of the few Jobs I couldn't stand. Mgmnt  was sometimes against you. It was hard to get assistance when needed. 1 month after I Quit, most of all management was either let go or got reduced to a basic floor person."
bad,"I want to get a new job,just to get away from lowes,the emoloyees that they bring in are very lazy and never clean or keep the store up to its standards"
bad,"Managment is horrible, rude. I‚Äôts all a show. Worst job I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs okay at first. First month or so. But I would NEVER work here long term. Couldn‚Äôt handle it."
bad,I'm the type of person to never expect anything in return. But when I went above and beyond I still wasn't even acknowledged once. I completed all required to-dos for the day and still wasn't enough to make management happy.
bad,"Lowes is a terrible place to work. They do not give you the tools you need, nor the guidance that you need to perform your job properly. Then blame you for not doing a good enough job!"
bad,First off if you have to work at a Lowes they'll take anybody that can pass a 3-day mouth swab drug test and I do mean anybody. We really have the bottom of the barrel of the workforce there are people here that have been working 20 years and don't even make $20 an hour. My first year I got $0.14 raise it was a .6% of my salary. I love my job as I assemble things in the store but don't expect any help from the management. You are just a body and they will put you on the floor in any Department that they need because so many employees don't show up for work are always calling out sick. They're very proud of saying they hired 35 new people but only two of them are going to stay past 3 months.  The turnover rate is unbelievable here and the no-shows and the calling sick and the people that are disgruntled it is amazingly High. If you switch positions here and it is a lower-paying job they will decrease your salary and then you won't get a raise for another year in that one position doesn't matter if you're almost been there 1 year or not if you change positions before your anniversary you start over again. You are expected to work every single holiday except for Thanksgiving and Christmas. There is almost no job promotions in here at all. It's the worst place I've ever worked at my life.
bad,"They have there favorites and they show it... They make pregnant women lift toilets and paint and dont care if they get hurt or not, lowes is out for themselves only, this is the worse job ive ever had. The so called coaches hide and are never anywhere to be found."
bad,"No chance for advancement unless you're in the ""click"" unfair workloads. Too much favortism. Not a good place to work if you're a male but if you're an attractive female you will go far."
bad,"Pros: Let me get back to you on that"
bad,"Shifts rotate on a daily basis.  You Open two to three days a week and close the rest.  There is no accountability for individuals who do not do their fair share of the work.  After eliminating a level of management Lowe's created a promotion road block.  They would rather hire form outside the organization than promote from within.  I have observed four instances of just that happening in the last two months."
bad,"Should be a relaxed environment, but poor management hinders every effort to enjoy the work day or even to accomplish very much."
bad,"It is like working in a high school surrounding.  The management uses it's employee's.  You are either worked to death or hardly working.  Once you learn your job, you are put on the back burner to the ""new"" very inexperienced employee's.  They do not promote on merit.  They don't even recognize the hard working employees."
bad,"Lowe's overall pays very decently for a retail job, although it was extremely stressful and poorly managed. Management never really acted on anything and did not are about what any employee has to say or think, and you rarely even see them throughout your work day."
bad,Management is promoted based on friendship and not merit or work product.  Several large groups of employees were terminated due to hitting a 10 year time limit.  Loved what I did but disliked the culture due to executive management.
bad,"Bad place for longer,tenured employees. Store manager sacrifices long,term employees to trim overhead during holidays. This is bad when you have kids. Total spy and,cutthroat environment. Tried to force me into confessing to a safety violation. Due to no video evidence, they took coerced tesimony from two employees that were to serve as witnesses. When I refused to say what the store manager wanted, I was,escorted our of the store. Managers will,toss employees under the bus at any opportunity to save themselves. Find a real job. Don't work here. To many good workers have been lost."
bad,I would not recommend anyone working for this company. Terrible management..!!!!!!!!!!!!! Certain stores are better than others. You never get recognition for anything.!!!!!  Conservative christians are targeted at this company.!!!!!
bad,"Unrealistic expectations!  Management does not have your back employee's stab you in the back, treatment of new employees are horrible! The program is designrd for you to fail, and management makes sure you don't succeed as well as all the backstabbing employee's!!"
bad,Fun to work at most times somedays you dont want to br hear because of management but the people u work with are good people to be around and thats all i have to say about that
bad,Management were all micro managers. It would run downhill from the store manager until it reached the employees. Pay was just a few dollars over minimum wage at the time so you were just under the poverty line. Expected to push sales even as a nightstocker to no benefit. Really wouldn't recommend a company like this unless you're young in college or something like that. Or working part time to supplement income but then usually you wouldn't have fixed hours.
bad,"Hostile racist environment store 2838, 38 special is what employees nickname this store. Management is biased and unfair to people of color. Customers are racist too!"
bad,I was fired for something I did not do. It was a corporate descision not a store desicision. I loved most of the people I worked with but management hardly ever answered the phones and I was left at the customer service desk by myself quite often and it was always busy.
bad,"I learned how to not treat your employees.  Do not yell at them or scream at them in front of customers.  Do not talk down to your employees and they need to praise people for the work that is done. I understand that you have to be professional when dealing with guests, but honestly the way I was treated there was horrible.  I worked hard everyday and that was still never good enough for the management.  Management does get upset when you get sick and call off, and when you return to work they make you feel terrible for being out sick.  They are condescending management and I was so happy to leave there.  They never give raises and if they do it is a couple pennies worth.  Granted something is better than nothing, but for the people who have been working there for a long time should be shown a little appreciation. Oh and not to mention, their sales are not really sales, they just make you think that it is on sale."
bad,Yeah they show you the good lunch employee events somethings like that are nice but the favpritism is ridiculous their unless you have friends at the top your notngoing anywhere
bad,"Management and leadership is below operational standard. Very unproductive, Since the last past 8 month prior to changing the store manager. so many talented employee's has departed or has left the store front. so many have been hired with little of no assistance service manager's having the knowledge to lead and provide positive image in operations of the store. lack of leadership, lack of professional customer service assistance, lack of ability, skills and mostly non customer service knowledge to assist home owners needs. my rating will have to be below 30 percent."
bad,many times need a day off for family life and was denied. they give you sick days but write you up for using them. this is a horrible company to work for its very disorganized.
bad,This is a go into work everyday and wonder if you will have a job the next day. Management is where if you are not in there click you are an outcast. This is the only place where you can do your job and still get yelled at. Managers do not manage!
bad,When I first started at Lowes it was a great place to work with great people. They are now moving to 75% part time and 25% full time staffing to save on payroll. People that know what they are doing are pulled in several different directions often being over whelmed while others get away with doing quite literally nothing. Management is  unprofessional and speaks poorly about associates in front of other associates.
bad,"they expect you to do every thing even when their are not enough people to do the work"
bad,"Do not hire enough employees to cover duties, so there is lack of customer service. Stressful. Poor management, lack of team effort."
bad,"You will not be trained for your position! If you work hard, you will do your managers job and many other lazy associates.  The day you decide 2 do your job that you were hired for, your called into the managers office and they question your work ethic, and your ability 2 be a team player.  Avoid this company!"
bad,"it began as a good fun place to work, my department was often challenging and we had more freedom than most being out of the store all the time, new management and corporate restructuring has seriously ruined that. they now show less concern about the wellfare of their employees and more with making more money, which does not trickle down to the employees"
bad,"poor retail hours, poor management, employees don't care about anything. Customers complain constantly. Lowes does not put enough staff on the floor and they do not put forth any effort to train their employees."
bad,"Due to lack of communication between the store level and Coporate Office, the customer service is terrible and due to recent restructuring it is getting worse.  The company is hemorrhaging money on new software, and trying to keep up with the market segment in retail. Online sales are terrible and no one in the stores are experienced in the area's they are having to cover due to no hiring at the store level and trying to consolidate any business they can to the coporate call center, which in turn is upsetting to the very customer base they are trying desperately not to loose.  The ""Pro"" Customer is leaving in droves to the Home Depot and now the ""DIY"" Customer is also being pushed out due to the lack of knowledge and employees to help them with their products/projects. "
bad,"Poor leadership, unproductive, unfair and soul killing!!! "
bad,Retail. Management sucks.  Very short staffed and customers are always complaining that they can't find help.  Nobody is happy there.  Always working the holidays
bad,"Working there was like sitting in a high school classroom, the people working there act like a bunch of rotten teenage girls straight out of Mean Girls. There's gossip mongers, teachers pets, cliches, and a few outcasts that are actually nice. However, I would never recommend working here to anyone for any reason."
bad,"Working at South Philadelphia Lowes overnight was really stressful lots of lazy guys calling off and manager tell you to do what they want dont treat you like human while the lazy worker get it easy and steal merchandise sleeps on the job, if your willing to bust your as for the lazy worker work while coworker take off everyweek  and get treated like a dog with bad pay this is the job for you.."
bad,"learning all that was needed for the job was the hard part"
bad,"putting away stock, dealing with repeat customers, usually I was the only person between 2-3 different departments, doing price quotes, maintenance on the aisles, receiving merchandise.  I enjoyed one on one customer interaction and the interaction between employees."
bad,"overall a very mismanaged and depressing work environment"
bad,"Very cut-throat place. They pretend there is room for advancement, but if you do not know the right people, you will never move up. Management is unqualified, and CEO only cared about profits  not employees"
bad,"You'll be doing the more than what you think is required to get the job done. Under staffed and over worked. "
bad,"Very poor management, no communication between shifts, and the responsibility is all on the closing shifts. No matter how bad the day was, it's your fault if so and so left their trashpile out all day, or there are empty places on shelves even though the product isn't in stock. "
bad,"Don't have any words to describe them. What  else do you want me to say. Well they only keep people who don't want to work with them.and those who are qualified for the job,they just kick them out,with their big lies that you are tardy."
bad,It was very unorganized and unprofessional. The management there wasn't stable. People were constantly quitting or losing their jobs. The scheduling was awful and you barely got enough hours.
bad,"Very poor upper management in corporate office, they have ruined a once good company for their own personal gains and greed ! They need new direction and management!"
bad,"typical retail hours with weekends and holidays."
bad,"With so many managers now, you're told over and over to do the same thing even after it has been done. No one seems to be on the same page. If you do not want to continuously go into the office and inform them what other employees are doing, prepare to be treated poorly. If you get injured and are no longer beneficial to them, they do whatever it takes to get rid of you."
bad,Lowes used to be a great company.  Today they have taken a different direction and focus.  this has caused a chain of events that is taking this company down.  They got rid of all department managers and are trying to make it so almost all the employees are part time.
bad,"This job is worse than Walmart , I love the customers. I can deal with the customers . It was the employees the management that I couldn't deal with . It was so unorganized, unprofessional. Very stressful job . I will never recommend this job for someone who wants to advance in their career . I will recommend this job for people who are in school , no strings attached."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the public.  Extremely satisfying dealing with the customer's needs.  Management was inadequate, to say the least.  Had absolutely NO LOYALTY to their long-term employees.  Had a history of firing their highest paid employees who just so happened to have 20+ years of employment.  Their goal is to have the facility be a short-term place of employment to keep the salaries down to the absolute minimum..  SAD."
bad,If you like to be worked as a slave and not get recognized and compensated for it accordingly this is the job for you. Too much of a workload for employees ever since the management change everything has gone bad. we make money one day but by the next the customer service desk is swamped with customers returning merchandise. Get treated badly not only by management but by customers as well. Not flexible with scheduling anymore they just throw you whatever schedule they want without acknowledging your availability.
bad,"I have only been a head cashier at Lowe's for almost 4 months and it has been a horrible experience... They have taken advantage of my availability multiple times and, on a daily basis, treat me very poorly... They do not treat their workers fairly and definitely have not earned my respect. They don't help you when you need it, they just pawn it off onto someone else.... Now I have weak hips, which makes standing for 8 hours a day tough for me and Its tough to get a note for. We are NOT allowed to sit down anymore because one employee said something that wasn't true. They definitely pick favorites...  Unfair"
bad,The recruiting department wants you to give great candidate experience but don't  provide it for the department it self. The pay for TA specialist are at entry level pay the job description is for an Administrative assistant the culture is horrible you fear for your job everyday. Management abuse their authority. You can't speak to the higher management without permission as of the VPs  are a GOD.
bad,"Hard work place once you are full time, you do not get to see your family very much due to corporate rotation. The workplace is very stressful and there is never enough employees for customer ratio, which causes customer and employee complaints."
bad,This company is a company thst do not care about the good people that works for them. They will lie to you without taking a blink. The management has to be one of the worst ever. The hire from other company's that don't known the Lowe's way and will force others to trained them . Management doesn't provide all with the same only the one they like.
bad,"A good manager makes Lowe's more than just another retail place. A bad manager makes Lowe's a place that you don't even want to shop at, much less work. Sadly, Lowe's seems to only fight to keep the bad ones."
bad,"Enjoyed learning about lumber and building materials, customer interaction was fun and mostly enjoyable, however erratic work hour schedule and sloppy management was frustrating.  HR was a joke, what went on in their offices and in there heads was far from reality on the floor. Training program was even more of a joke, my faith in humanity dropped several points after working in this environment. I'm sure Lowes is a good place to work in other locations, but not this one. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"You're on your own to get your orders ready, loaded and delivered. All managers do is complain and try to rush you, they have absolutely no knowledge of commerical trucks and the laws that go along with it. The pay sucks and there's a ton of work that comes with this job. They want you to work weekends. Horrible vibe cause Lowes loves to ""downsize"" and ""restructure"" the store laying off lots of employees."
bad,I have worked for Lowe's for almost 1 year.  I have never been written up nor had any actions by human resources.  A few months back we went thru the termination of several department managers and all the remaining mangers had to reapply for their jobs after 1 year.  The turnover is terrible and if you are a hard working individual with great customer service skills don't come here looking for a fulltime job.  This would be great for someone already receiving a pension or is retired on social security.  It is not for someone trying to make a living and supporting a family.  Thumbs down all the way!!!!!
bad,"Worked there in multiple departments.  Don't expect any recognition of your work from management, or their help...they'll just walk on by you, no matter how busy your department is and no matter how angry customers are getting due to waiting.  If you're on returns, they will never, ever have your back.  They basically walk around the store not doing much of anything, just bossing people around and passing off customers regardless of how busy you are.  Department managers are decent at least.   Part timers are extremely mistreated; over worked, not offered the incentive package...expendable and indentured servitude.   Expect weird hours with no consistency of any kind, early mornings, late evenings,  stupidly low pay for the amount of work you do, and short staffing of departments.  That being said, among some of the most miserable and defeated employees you'll ever meet, there are a few really good and fun people who work the floor.  But really, you're probably better off monitoring a tire fire than working here.  At one point the washroom wasn't even cleaned for days because the management didn't book any of the cleaning staff in, and God forbid they did something.   I've been in cleaner washrooms on construction sites.  Done my rant...basically, don't expect much if you want to work here."
bad,"My most recent experience with Lowe's was horrible. I"
bad,"I was a night stocker at the Whitby Lowe's. The job was TERRIBLE. the night crew manager was the worst boss I have ever worked for. He did not know how to divide the work load properly. He constantly stood at the end of the aisle to watch you. "
bad,"Lowe's has become a horrible company to work for compared to what it was 10 years ago. I feel unvalued as an employee, after laboring for 10 years, I've next to nothing to show for it. No actual enrichment, passion, or desire to stay with a company that puts a higher value on their upper management and kissing up than their own work force. Lowe's 2017 corporate restructure is costly and destructive, and if they continue to make these kind of decisions they'll end up like Sears. I wish I had never gone to work at Lowe's."
bad,Management there is a joke. Bunch of stuck up morons on a power trip and they won't even participate in the work. They try there hardest to never ever do the same things you're asked to do everyday.
bad,"At this Lowes the 2 unloaders would have to do a whole freight truck by ourselves wth nobody coming out and helping us but they would complain until we were done. Most of he older employees will be very nasty to you if you are a younger kid. Receiving managers and employees are some of the best people I've met, the front however is cliquey, if you don't work in the front part of the store expect to get treated like dirt and get fired if you miss two days in 9 months"
bad,"An uncompromising lot of ineffectual management ""staff"" that are incompetent, at the best of times, are there to disallow adequate workday hours and will never acknowledge or credit those hard-working employees, all-the-while praising those that do the lowest amount of work, but happens to occasionally please a customer with a joke or tangential recollection of a story."
bad,truly the worst company i have ever worked with. from no training to the unwillingness to work with employees schedule changes. management is impossible to work with. ask a question and your looked at like your a fool.
bad,"If you want to be talked about and not to Lowe's is the place for you. Everyone pawns their job off on you and they all complain. Management is lazy and if you're not a favorite they will look to fire you. a manager worked there for 15 years and got fired out of know where. The new ""rules"" only benefit certain people. The head cashier's are rude and treat you like your stupid and the other workers on the floor don't want anything to do with anyone. You can work ""part time"" and work 36 hours a week. To them ""business is business"" and if you have a family you are not a favorite. So if you wanna work in a place that's cut throat and full of drama go ahead and apply. If you get the job though watch your back you are not garenteed."
bad,This is a great company to work for if you would like some extra money in college. The hours were a little crazy and leadership did not really help me get on the corporate side once I graduated like they promised.
bad,"Feel part of the company, encouraging team experience, managers help to improve and support members"
bad,"...Current corporate business model places a premium on replacing experienced, older workers with very young part/full time low wage employess...each day has a climate of fear from possibly being written up/ fired from HR and  Management...Store Manager was over heard stating that no one under the age of 30 should be working for Lowe's...the hardest part is providing coverage in many other departments that are short staffed, and helping frustrated customers"
bad,"I worked here for 6 month and it was the worse experience with a job I ever had. The pay was good, but a few fellow associates who were good people had low pay and no raises dissipate being there longer than me.   I applied to be a LTL Stock and was told to come in for an interview for the job. When i got there i was told only a cashiering position was open, despite the news i proceeded with the job offer because i was not picky. I had promises of clear and possible advancements but when i gave it some time was given more empty promises . i had problems with some associates and when i told management they said the could try and adressed it but time  showed other wise. The younger associates ARE more professional than  management and older associates. I did not want to quit . Being jobless became a greater piece of mind than a good paying job . i was only part time and this store and company abuses the budget cuts that come with part time associates. Management is a joke treats you like a joke. The manager has ZERO care for her employees and sits in her office while the store is short staffed and busy."
bad,"Don't recommended to work for this company , does not know how to treat employees, abuse them all the time. Already few employees lefts already, keep changing new management and it very disorganized at least the store that I work at is a mess.."
bad,I did not get enough hours. It didn't pay to drive there. Management was a joke. There were higher up people who didn't care about anyone other than themselves
bad,"Management does not support staff. Customers treat front end staff horribly and management does nothing to discourage it. You are not given the tools to provide the customer with the great customer service they expect. Stores are ALWAYS understaffed, which of course makes the customers angry when they cannot get service, the cashiers are the target of the angry customers. Avoid being a cashier or customer service associate it you can. This is not a good company to work for to say the least."
bad,Management is horrible and acts as a mafia. Only those who are in the inner circle get promoted. I will never apply. Or ship at Lowes. They've lost a customer.
bad,"My experience at Lowe's was not a very pleasant one. I'm not saying all of the Lowe's are like that, however the one I was at wasn't very good. When I first started their they were great, or so it seemed, but once I started nights and saw what truly went on things got complicated. When I say complicated, I mean more like their; ""open door policy"" is questionable, wanting opinions for the better of the company is questionable, and trying to tell your employers there is something funny going on within the company with one of the employees, you end up no longer working for the company with no cause of being let go. You tell me do you work at Lowe's or not? The only good that I got from working at Lowe's is meeting a few good people, my significant other, the benefits, and understanding that I catch on quick, very quick! I enjoyed helping customers and making them happy although some would say that's hard, I found the one Lowe's I worked at was very tough."
bad,"Did 16 years of service to customers and company loyalty and was laid off just like that. "
bad,this company is very unethical. ive seen things that are just not right and i dont think any respectable person would approve. Unfair treatment towards employees.
bad,"Company transitioned from employee centric great place to work to low cost employer. Majority of benefits eliminated, no job security, thousands of layoffs in last 5 years, jobs moved to India, low moral, elimination of full-time positions - replaced with part-time low wage no benefits jobs. CEO and leadership only interested in short term profit, no longer working to build company for the future."
bad,Pay was lousy as was the management. I had never worked for a company before that didn't believe in giving 10 minute breaks to their  employees. I worked for Lowes in Virginia and in New York. If you worked 8 hours you got your lunch break for an hour. That was it.
bad,Work employees to the breaking point. horrible hours and schedules. Store managers pal around with employees and pick favorites.
bad,"They need better store mangers that know the products they are selling. Never are able to find employees to help customer service, to busy trying hid out."
bad,There is NO work/life balance here. Wages are ok and benefits could be better.  There is NO job security and NO room for advancement unless you are friends with upper management. Many good employees are being forced to leave due to the unscrupulousness of the store management and loss prevention staff. They can't even keep an HR manager because of their underhandedness. I suggest looking elsewhere for employment.
bad,"The company is constantly moving the needle on performance.   It is a popularity contest in most cases, but when times get rough they go after the hourly associates that have the most tenure.  When they go to restructure, they keep their tenured ASM's, regardless of their performance.  Lack of consistency in managing the team to drive results."
bad,"Lowe's is the most ""unionized"" non-union organization I have ever worked for. Excessive and outdated job titles and positions that perform the same functions. Seniority poor performers create an impenetrable ceiling for new and inspired talent - who quickly lose hope and leave. Decision making is slow and backwards at best - or ineffective and targeted to compliance rather than commitment."
bad,They want results but would not let you achieve them. Like working with your hands tied behind your back. They care about $$$ and not employees making the $$ for them. If they cared about their employees... the sales would come because you would have happy productive employees.
bad,"A typical day involved being inundated and understaffed because of chronic tardiness and call-outs by the same people. If you make an effort to do well, customers notice and are appreciative but there is zero positive feedback from management. You're expected to pick up the slack for those who are late (or don't even show up) and for departments that aren't staffed until hours later, but it's not a two-way street. Don't expect to get your break or lunch on time (if at all) and management will go out of their way to find things to criticize despite your best efforts. Rather than promoting from within, they prefer to hire from outside and end up hiring thieves (well done, HR)."
bad,"I work on the front end and would really like to learn more about the different positions and how to do more things like mix paint, cut keys, etc in order to move into a new position some day but am unable to do so as management has told me flat out I'm not allowed to go on the floor for any kind of training. If positions on the floor do open up, cashier are very rarely interviewed for them. "
bad,"The management does not care about their employees. They have a high turn over because they are not flexible at any time. "
bad,"Each experience is different, the harder and better a person works in their position, the less likely the company will promote. Kept getting told, ""We don't want to lose you to a better position."" Management would bad mouth the employee to other companies thinking that is the best way to keep the person from going up in the company. My experience was not good. Moved on. 20-30 cent raises only, no matter if yearly raise or company promotion, no difference."
bad,I worked as an appliance sales specialist for 8 months. I have worked for a few places in my life but this was by far the worst experience! Management does not care for their staff and are only out for their bonuses that they draw off the hard working people. You consistently have to watch other departments as well as your own as they staff the buildings to a minimum. You have to multi task all the time and you get worn out in a very short time. I wish that I had read the reviews about working here before I started. Also you get extremely low wages for the work that you are accountable for. The hours are also horrible and you don't get out until 11:00 p.m. Run as far away as possible!!!!!
bad,"lots of favoritism from management. over worked and underpaid."
bad,"Are you under 30 and a male? If the answer is yes prepare to be abused."
bad,They don't care about your personal life and they constantly threaten you with being fired. More politics then Washington.
bad,By far the worst company I have ever worked for. Management was horrendous. Fired people left and right usually due to politics. Their way of solving the issue of people quitting is to give mandatory overtime. Long hours with very little breaks.
bad,Upper management is not involved and lacks communication. The company is ALWAYS short staffed and expects you to do the job of 3 people. I tried talking to the store manager about my concerns and he had no interest. The company requires that you are available at all times and you must work 3/4 weekends a month. Save yourself the trouble and don't apply.
bad,"Have seen many,many men be fired for things that were not their fault. Very heartless for their workers. Better not have one single accident or out the door you will go. Seen it many times. Not reliable for long term. The management only want to pad their own pockets at the employees expense. Work endless hours in freezing rain or intense heat.  Constantly hiring due to constant firing."
bad,"The job is providing customer assistance, re-stocking, and maintaining a clean area/dept/store.  This is physically challenging work!"
bad,"Leadership aka management do not perform theyre duties well. It is a good workling enviroment, but lacks good workers."
bad,"I worked for Lowe's Home Improvement for almost eight years. I worked at two different stores. I worked at a Lowe's near South Bend, Indiana for three years. Then I worked at a Lowe's in Indianapolis for 4 and a half years. At first working for Lowe's was pretty good. I managed to move up within a year of starting to department manager. I did this for about a year until I decided to go back to school and finish my degree. My first store was pretty good about me continuing my education. I stepped down to focus on school and everything was pretty good."
bad,"Culture to this organization is to figure it out for yourself and perhaps if you stumble upon the right answer it will adopt your findings. If this ""Organization"" could get out of its own way they could actually make some real profit. That, unfortunately, would have to start with taking a long hard look at the person/persons operating it stores. My case in point is when a  store that makes roughly 70 million a year and with change in management makes barely half of that for the following 5 years and corporate management does nothing to supersede, well, there's not just something wrong with the store."
bad,"I was not happy working for Lowes, they did not take care of there workers and tended to play favorites and would not treat every employee as an equal"
bad,Lowe's was the sort of place you were told to help the customers and their needs but not allowed to leave your department to do so. Even if they had questions that took you to multiple departments.
bad,"Really enjoyed what I was responsible for, the team I worked with and the clients we satisfied.  The work environment was quite negative, however, and collaborative team work became a challenge."
bad,"I was in need of full-time and worked very hard for 3 year and Corporate was nit hiring at that time. I was fond of my co-workers, we were a team, I engaged in my customers, they were like family and management listened."
bad,it use to be a fun job I use o be so happy to go to work I couldn't wait to go to work . ever since we had changed management now she yells at us treats us like children. my co workers are awesome I love them. if you are outside it sucks because its either to cold or too hot there is no water bottles outside and they build like a shed outside but they build it to late we use to have a chair outside but the new management took it.
bad,"Laid off employees and were very lax on trying to keep employees on. Store was already short on workers at the time. Customer service oriented,  Indoor Garden, Outdoor Power Equipment, Seasonal area, directed customers to necessary products and helped them accomplish daily tasks and set up dream projects for home. Maintained look of racks and performed daily cleaning tasks as well as customer carry-outs"
bad,"working warehouse environment, noisy, dusty, poor working conditions, walking the floor, sitting in a small camera room"
bad,"Company cares about sales, but not employees, opportunities are not there, company lacks training, employees overall are not happy"
bad,"The people I worked with were, for the most part, nice.  The issue was the lack of communication within the management infrastructure, which caused a lot of issues with scheduling and customer satisfaction, and they would place the blame on the workers below them.  This was just the delivery department at one location (Goliad Rd.) and other locations seemed much better run.  There was an instance where one driver was repeatedly being a dangerous driver, and when management was told they swept it under the rug.  We often didn't have time to take a lunch but they insisted on still docking us 30 minutes every day."
bad,"Imagine being tasked with covering five different cashier positions with only three cashiers and yourself, you are told to, ""get it done, cover that extra position,"" by your manager who yells at you because it isn't covered, and on top of that you have nobody coming in to cover shifts later because HR hasn't hired any new cashiers and you've been given an impossible schedule for your employees availability and THEN you also need to make sure that these thankless cashiers also get their lunches and breaks while maintaining a summer rush and on and on. You also are required to take little tests on a computer, and there's a minimum you are required to do every week, so that has to fit in the schedule as well or you will receive write ups. You will have a promotion dangled in front of you like a carrot which you will never receive because they'd rather hire new people for those positions instead of granting them to current employees. Their system constructs a horrible work environment."
bad,"I love working with customers!  It gives me great pleasure helping them find and purchase the items they need.  However, management attempts to keep me from doing my job to the best of my ability."
bad,"I did not work for Lowes directly, I was a subcontractor in all fields of commercial construction. I did not get paid from Loews stores but I was treated great by all."
bad,"while i was thankful for my pay rate and the fact i received benefits for being part-time, still doesnt make up for the fact that it matters more who you are, not what you can do. way too much favoritism....and major discord on the front line in general. and if u were not a brown-noser u were considered lower than low"
bad,"I worked in the delivery department at Lowes.  I drove a Class B flatbed truck that took construction materials to worksites.  I enjoyed the deliveries and got along well with my coworkers.  The store that I worked for had poor sales, due in part to its out of the way location.  Lowes brought in a new management team to cut costs.  One of the ways that they decided to cut costs was to eliminate our eight hour shifts.  The new management asked the delivery department members to clock out between deliveries.  They said that the move was voluntary and that we could keep our eight hours shifts if we chose to.  We chose to keep our eight hour shifts.  As a result of our decision, the delivery department was constantly harassed.  We were written up for everything.  I was written up for a delivery damage on a delivery that I did not make.   I was written up because one of the other driver's paperwork was not in order!  Within three weeks, the entire department was fired and replaced.  Those were good responsible people, people who we're doing their best to provide for their families.  Lowes humiliated them and threw them to the street.  Six people were fired from that department.  The Ohio Bureau of Unemployment Services investigated all six firings and found that all of them were unjustified.  Don't work for this company, don't shop at their stores.  You deserve better."
bad,"Learned as much as possible on my own, didnt get any training"
bad,Management doesnt pick the best person for the job its all based on who kisses the most butt. Also they expect more more more and i got tired of busting my butt when they didnt care about me as an person my wife started before i did she got paid more hourly and pay check wise and she was part time as i as full.. I will never work for that place again.
bad,Clean. wrap meat. stock shelves. label merchandise. maintain composure.
bad,"The store I worked at in Easley had absolutely no employee oversight. Management had no clue what the employees do every day, they're  only concerned with the numbers coming up right. I routinely worked shifts with 1 or 2 other employees in my area who I rarely saw do anything."
bad,I worked at Lowes 546 in Macon Ga it was the wrost place to work management wasnt knowledgeable. Blamed the ppl in the departments for mistake s that managers made. No team work everyone in the store was just defeated.
bad,"Seasonal cashier position was pretty bad. pretty much at first they gave me great hours, but very little pay. It was an easy position. I had no retail experience at all though, and they trained me for about 20 minutes and just through me out there by myself, and they do that to all the new hires as well. As time progressed they started cutting everyones hours without warning and would change the schedule time and time again without notice. Currently only working 15 hours a week, isn't helping me pay the bills. I appreciate the company for the experience, but would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,"The most brutal retail job I've ever worked.  "
bad,"Assistant managers were consistently treating some employees better than others, often overlooking their favorites' activities while writing up the same behavior on those disfavored."
bad,"Lowe's Store #2330 (Mira Loma) could be better if the store manager was replaced. She is very neurotic and very controlling over all of her associates. Her micromanaging style is so overbearing, it affects everyone in the store including the customers. I have had customers complain about her frequent over head pages. They claimed it ruined the entire shopping experience. Unfortunately this does not stop at overhead pages. The store manager also brings in disguises. She has been known to bring in baggy ""civilian"" clothing in order to disguise herself during store hours. She does this so she can walk around the store unnoticed and spy on store employees. Overall, with her running the store, I have had a terrible experience here. The only good days is when she is on vacation."
bad,"I would have to say after 12.5 Years that the real lowes is no longer here as they cut our commisions in half with a 3 day notice over 2 years ago, then have systematically been getting rid of all the producers? Yes the people that actually make them money? Why pure greed and short sightedness and wanting to be just like home depot. Why cant you understand following doesn't make you a better place to work"
bad,"It's the black hole of retail, and one of the worst corporate ones. You bend over backwards for both the customer and management with not even a pat on the back. This so called ""Family-oriented"" company, would rather keep fulltimers at fulltime and parttimers at parttime. No moving up, just moving over."
bad,"Doing your best just is not enough with the management team, at least at the location I was at. It was just constant crying in the break room about what this manager did to this person while working. One manager holds people back from leaving against their will despite their shift ending. One worker zones every square inch of shelved products top to bottom, and a manager would come out, inspect, and just blatantly say ""This department looks ugly"" in a sour, scolded tone."
bad,"Management at this lowes is below par."
bad,Handled customer returns of merchandise or defective items while maintaining a high degree of customer satisfaction.Cashiered accurately and efficiency.Administered recommendations to customers and directed to areas of interest.Answered incoming telephone calls and transferred to appropriate departments or personnel/distributed accurate messages.Assisted head-cashier‚Äôs with night closing of cash register‚Äôs at end of day.
bad,"Lowes Use to be a great Company to work for. This is no longer true. There are no associates everyone is now referred to as simply ""RED VESTS"". I regret wasting the amount of time that I did to watch this company circle the drain. The store managers have all developed a culture of I matter it will be your job before mine. This is not a close minded view as I have worked all over my district and for several managers in several positions. The associates all ban together because if they didn't there would be no support. most of the time you can not find an ASM and when you do they respond with answers like you handle it or find such and such. Not all ASMs are this way but the vast majority are. I left reluctantly but I had to because I needed a life with a lot less stress."
bad,lowes on w colonial was the worst lowes ive ever worked at. poor managment and customer service. lack of communication.
bad,"I worked with a younger group of employes, I am 60, mostly young men.I am a woman.  I worked in the garden center where the work was a little harder than in most of the store. I didn't mind this, I loved working there.Kept me in shape. But I was usually the only one working. The young men were always off in other parts of the store somewhere, not helping out in the garden.Most of the time I could not find some one to help load items into customers cars. I would have been off for a couple days and when I come back the garbage would be over flowing, the plants were not watered, and I would be the one to get into trouble. The garden ""manager"" and one of the other young men would always be hanging out together, and no where in sight. They would be off in the store somewhere else instead of garden area working. The management left a lot to be desired. Most of the time they ignored you and your questions. And the moral there! foul language, even from management. So unprofessional. The employees were all on ""ME"" kicks, power plays, bossy and unfriendly."
bad,"This company  was a nightmare to work for. Breaks and lunches were never given on time if at all. I saw a lot of discrimination towards a specific group. They had several complaints filed against them with the labor board. Management  talked about this openly with associates. After not being allowed a bathroom break after 6 hours, I walked out and never looked back. "
bad,They use loopholes to cut your hours and lay you off. The manager is pretentious and refuses to work alongside employees. The pay is alright for the area but they fire you before you are eligible for benefits. It is alright for seasonal but don't let them lie to you about the length of employment. They say you will be there for no less than 6 moths and have the potential to be hired on but that isn't the case. You rarely get breaks and cannot smoke during breaks and on lunch you have to leave the property to smoke.  
bad,It is the worse place to work for. They hire every three months and after two months almost every single person they hire quit.
bad,I've been with Lowe's for 14 years and found that there is no chace for opportunity. The management sucks!!! I wish I had never came here for a job.
bad,I worked there for more than 20 years and during one of there many restructuring's was laid off. They dissected the position that I held until most functions were given to others then when the economy turned they sent many of us packing.
bad,i have worked for this company and they treat you like trash. they do not care about their employees
bad,Total customer focus base not employee. Does not take professionalism and experience into count. Performance does not mean anything to company. Only what is going to make stockholders happy.
bad,This company is a billion dollar company that does not pay there employees nor do they support them. A typical day at work is met with challenges of just trying to get a delivery truck out on time with no help from you're supervisor or the store period. You spend 2 weeks on a computer that constantly freezes for orientation. After that you wait a good 2 months to get certified on everything you watched on that computer. Management there is a joke. You have to bend there arms to get them to do ANYTHING period. Management does not support there employees at all. I am a 14 year military veteran and supervisor never have I seen a place throw there own under the bus the way they do. There is no integrity at all between coworkers. The hardest part of the job is trying to actually get the day rolling. The most enjoyable part is when the day is over.
bad,"Customers always come first. Without them all retail stores would close. You want the customers to continue coming back. Management on the other hand, I gave up a job that I really loved because of a manager. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a manager that needed a long class on anger management. Otherwise, I loved my job, and met all of my daily budgets, and had many very satisfied customers. I made outside appointments to go to customers houses to take sample books and help discuss different products for them to purchase."
bad,Hardest part of the job was the whole work environement.
bad,"typing , filing, answering phones all day long, talking to management about things"
bad,"Work was fine a bit mundane. Training was chaotic and lacked any structure or organization. Half of fellow employees were completely disrespectful , too worried about playing games in break room with store manager and letting new employees do all the work. After seeing how inventory was thrown and kicked and customers were thought of and treated won‚Äôt be buying anything from Lowes, especially Simpsonville."
bad,"Lowes of Missoula sucks, the management is just out for themselves, nevers listens to the workers. Never come out of office. They are cutting all of the benefits. So please be aware. The hours sucks."
bad,"this company is a typical big box store they don't care about anything but sales they don't care about there employees all they are is a number to lowes.I learned how complete several task at once. help customers answer phones. sales special orders, stock sales phone orders loading customers."
bad,it was okay if you don't have any serious bills or responsbilities
bad,"Administration not up to par. Not truthful. Smile in face and you know the other. Great turnover; now I no why. Too click-based establishment in Suffolk, Va. Lowe's."
bad,incompetent managers. treat employees like slaves. constant punishment and retaliation. only care about profit not about workers or customers. avoid working or shopping here.
bad,"This is one of those jobs where you started out as a seasonal employee, and everything about the job was awesome. Then, when placed permanently, all the true colors of the management team start to show. The job itself was pretty well placed for me, challenging but not impossible. I however was not treated very well at all by the management on a daily basis, but, noone else was either. It became quite ridiculous actually by the time I left this employer."
bad,There work scheduals are never the same. They change all the time. If you don't have a life then they would be a good place to work.
bad,"Management does not run the store correctly or by policy. Very unfair and a lot of favoritism goes on. Atmosphere is unfriendly by cowrokers AND customers. A lot of theft happens and constantly have to deal with very difficult, mean, rude, customers. Management makes you do not only your own job but everyone elses also."
bad,Good place for face to face experience with customers- horrible place if you want a life.
bad,"Work is 95% transactional, very little strategic work. Training and support are minimal. Great for HR Admin, not for HR Manager or Generalist."
bad,"Bad/Bad/Bad! Not fairly compensated, very poor management team, favoritism. I loved my customers and miss them very much but not my co-workers. Overall very bad experience in the end!!!!!"
bad,great place for availability.  company only cares about share holders and not the associate has removed a bunch of positions with in the last month and still will be ...
bad,My experience was one that I would not like to repeat in my life. The culture as poor and there is a seriously high level of fear among the leadership within the company
bad,Lowe's cares more about numbers than they do about its employees. They want employees to be 100% productive but on pay 50% of their worth.  Company policy are not enforced unless they want you gone.
bad,I came on as a Loader in the North Columbus Store first thing I did as far as on hand work came with no training. I was expected to know all codes with out being explained the codes. I was expected to lift extremely heavy items without any help. Many times during the day I was left lost with out knowing what to do and mind you nobody there helps each other. With in first 30 minutes of work employees were explaining the bad with other employees there. Teamwork was lacking and help was lacking management needs better training on how to train their employees maybe with a bit of time and training and teaching the employees the company can be ran a bit more smoother. It almost felt like a mediocre jobsite with management lacking experience maybe a bit more teaching of managers and employees will make this company half decent. If I could put zero stars I would.
bad,"Corporate looks the other way as long as they are making a buck!"
bad,Lowes only thinks of themselves not the team that got them there.  If you are not popular with the management you will not exceed at anything no promotion nothing
bad,I was part of management but I can tell you from experience that my peers were terrible managers . They do not know how to manage  associates and can‚Äôt keep confidential information within each other .
bad,"There is a reason Lowes is not successful.  They don‚Äôt value employees or their work.  There company is heading in the wrong direction for the normal reasons.   Management does not value employees, they want the job done now, now, now.  They talk the talk but done care about getting there.  Management keeps lowering the pay for new employees, benefits are available but terrible value for the money.  Promotion is non-existent.  Managers are lazy and everything is someone else fault, lack of accountability is the culture"
bad,Hedge fund driven company that no longer puts its employees first. Extremely poor leadership at the regional level and above. No longer a place to make a career out of.
bad,"This company is always looking to (restructure) get rid of elder, higher  paid associates to bring in younger, lower paid employees to replace you. Horrible work ethic/culture, Store manager would promote based on, race and favoritism, not experience."
bad,"I witnessed a man attempting suicide, while on the clock,  in the Lowes men's restroom....was very traumatized....went to HR....asked for help....and was told , no. "
bad,"My experience at Lowe's was a downward spiral into Hades . Started off great, met lots of good people but then it went downhill from there. Store manager was a typical corporate kiss butt kind of guy. His minions were lazy, power hungry jerks. Not a place for people who can think for themselves."
bad,"Worst place I have EVER worked!!!  ""Good old boys club!""  Disrespectful store managers.  Make jokes about employees while employee within sight/hearing."
bad,"The biggest problem with Lowe's is it's store managers and market level staff creating a toxic work environment. Through alienating those they don't like, to their friendships and relationships that are clear conflict of interests."
bad,"This job started out ok. But they honestly don't train their overnight crew super well before they start working the overnights. Daytime management expects way more out of the workers than what they're paid for. Things are regularly blamed on the night crew that had nothing to do with them in the first place. But, because that crew is there overnight without customers, they're expected to fix everything that couldn't be done during the day shift, and if it isn't done they're scolded for not completing a job that wasn't theirs in the first place."
bad,"I've been with this company for over a decade and every year it's been at a steady decline. From the company taking away perks like comission, allowances and bonuses to the repeated yearly lay offs and them outsourcing to replace those lay offs. The CEO Marvin Ellison admittedly only cares only about it's shareholders  and not it's employees."
bad,To much emphases on stock value not on employee value still working with DOS computer programming a nightmare to get any thing done as well as fellow employees were are their for pay checks not to be helpful
bad,"Not a good company to work for, seems like a failing store.  Management is clueless about how to lead.  Changes that are being made seem to make things worse."
bad,"Company culture awful, management awful. They care about shareholders not employees. There are many violations of employment laws daily. Nepotism, favoritism, it goes on and on."
bad,I have not ever worked for a company like this you get no leadership from your upper management it seems as if everyone is out for themselves. Limited work life balance.
bad,"Shift Hours & work days completely vary from week to week. "
bad,"This company is an absolute joke. Your recruiter and hiring manager will promise a flexible work environment, strong culture and growth opportunities, but once you're hired, everything changes. Associates are not valued in the least. Management doesn't hold people accountable that aren't performing, so the entire team suffers, and your job changes once a month. Training is laughable at best. This is the most chaotic, disorganized job that I've ever had."
bad,"Lowe's use to be a great company to work for but over the years it only got worse when new CEO was appointed. It became all about the business and bot about the employees, I do understand all companies have goals and all but when you don't care about your employees cause they are disposable."
bad,"Non Friendly environment, only the customer matters. The Management out of a sense of favoritism. They didn't give an employee a fair shot at Training for order pickers Hi-lo or reach Truck."
bad,Starting I really like working there even if they don‚Äôt give you benefit if you are a seasonal employee.the management need work sometimes you feel neglected.
bad,"Zanesville, Ohio store is terrible. The store manager is blind or completely ignorant of whats happening around him. The ASM's are all lazy and burnt out. Most of the workers are inpersonable and lack any kind of customer service skills. Management ignores the lack of help and friendly atmosphere required to successfully operate a retail store. The fact that this store is still open for business just blows my mind. Worst job I've ever had. Couldnt wait to leave."
bad,"The company overall is headed in the right direction. However, this location is on a downward spiral. The store manager has no leadership skills whatsoever, has created a hostile work environment. He has prioritized his own laziness and destroyed a successful store. Routinely laughs at employees who ask for help, and refuses to wear a name tag. Other managers openly harass employees in front of others. When one section of the store is busy, the store manager will often remove all other associates from that area, and stand there out of uniform and watch as customers and employees get upset. Incentive programs are sabotaged by management."
bad,"Their scheduling system has ruined any ground they had with their workers, instead of being manually entered and plentiful hours, a system schedules employees based on when it assumes people will be there. Now I'm sure anyone can figure out why that's a bad idea. There are days we have 1 person in my department which spans almost half the store, for hours at a time. Dont work if you only want to be there around 13 hours a week."
bad,They suck management is terrible they don't appreciate anyone or anything. Store managers are just out for personal gain employee lunch and break room always dirty üò†üò°
bad,"Surprised I made it as long as I did."
bad,"Let me preface this by saying that I work(ed) in a distribution facility."
bad,"This company offers zero to no support for its store employees.  If you want to have your schedule changed without proper notice, to be stuck on a department as a cashier and unable to get breaks at a decent time or bathroom breaks or even to go home on time because management couldn't schedule people to fill in, work at Lowe's."
bad,"position was dissolved with no warning, and management has little knowledge of what is going on with day to day operations, little pay for the work required"
bad,Management is not worried about the employees unless you are a favorite! The ones that don't do anything are the ones they keep and cater to. Lack of support from management is a joke. Will page and page but no one calls or shows up.
bad,"I am not happy at Lowe‚Äôs because there is no employee loyalty, and most of the guys I work with are underpaid with no incentive to be productive, and the only reason why I stayed is the simple fact that I liked the people I worked with"
bad,Incompetent management. Only care about their bonuses and could care less about the employees. Awful schedules and awful pay. Good place for a college kid to work to make a few bucks.
bad,The store is poorly manager. The manager and assistant managers are racist. No respect to innovation and new ideas. They HR is very week and the manager are dictating
bad,"Hired in March and position eliminated June 28, 2019. Supervisors in some departments know nothing about the areas that they supervise. They also say things to employees that is not true and then DENY saying it, can‚Äôt trust what they say anymore!!!"
bad,"So I got hired for Lowe‚Äôs after passing their mouth swab and back ground check. First I must say their benefits suck , it‚Äôs way to expensive . They do pay decently well how ever they lie to get rid of you. After having a disagreement with my manager about needing help , I was called to the office the next night at the start of my shift and terminated for failing my background check after 3 months of employment. Managers suck, there clueless. Don‚Äôt even waste your time."
bad,"Worked there for over a decade, under 4 different store managers, and countless rotations of micro managers. The first 2-3 years there were great, really enjoyed it. We all worked as a team. Nowadays, its all corporate related, decisions and all. Everyone is watching out for themselves. No more team work, VERY low or nonexistant morale. Management doesnt help, EVER. They want you there, regardless of family emergencies, sickness, and unfortunate happenings."
bad,Average pay.  Little to no training.  Expect no appreciation from mgmt.  Expect to be constantly reminded how much mgmt. does for you.  It's a pay check.  It is a lack luster environment to work in.  Little was spent on technology.
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked! Dont do it!   RUNNN. Management is bad, your over worked and under payed, there is never enough staff to cover the shifts.  And that's if the management make the schedule correct! Lots of the time there are holes in the schedule."
bad,Do not work at this place treat you like üí© over work you lie about you job make you do 14 diff things way understated stupidity from the top down managment at 1509 targets people run off people who work literally like a prison way to much bs and stress company has gone so down hill
bad,Managers don't care about coverage and expect you to get all their task done while helping customers first with no coverage. They say they schedule now for customer satisfaction but now they only care about customers and not at all about employees.
bad,Don‚Äôt bother working here if you don‚Äôt like bein treated poorly by management  will fire people for the littlest things if they don‚Äôt like you or if you speak out against policies that don‚Äôt make sense or put worker safety in jeopardy
bad,Barely got training and kept switching hours on me dont care about health as i was in hospital all week and weekend and haven't heard back plus management is a disaster
bad,"Lowe's wants to move away from trained people and go with part time only. They will overwork you and reward you with minimal raises. Stay away, there are other options in the industry."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Embarassed that I wasted so much of my life working here only to be laid off under restructuring. "
bad,Do not work for this company. Poor management and even worse corporate zombies. This place is trying really hard to copy home depot and don't know why. I think they're trying to tank the stock so home depot will buy them out.
bad,"All the managers lie about everything. There isn't anyone in control. They want you to learn the whole store but they wont pay you for learning. They only care about the stocks, not the employees or customers."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs only cares about there bottom line, there employees are treated like minions in a bigger scheme. It is really sad that this company has changed so much. Management really needs a serious overhaul."
bad,When I started I felt fairly treated by the company. Even though when I first started the sentiment from the long time employees was the company was going downhill and making bad decisions. The longer I worked there the more I picked up on that same feeling from the things I saw done while I was there. And then to kill it all the good management team we worked for all move to other locations for career advancement and the team we were left with were just plain abusive to the employees
bad,Poor management and work culture. Unrealistic expectations. Abysmal staffing and scheduling. A lot off call ins on a daily basis. No accountability on upper management as well as proper guidence/training.
bad,"I worked there and really enjoyed my job there. Until New Management came in and started getting rid of people for unnecessary reasons, and just because they don‚Äôt like you. Terminate you for no reason and without any write ups! Very poor management."
bad,They don‚Äôt pay enough to live.  They don‚Äôt care about you or your life.  They have let amazing employees as they came in for their shift and replaced them with 3rd party companies.   They will tell you you are lazy and that it‚Äôs the employees fault that things don‚Äôt get done even if you are severely understaffed.  All they do is play favorites and let the favorites walk all over other employees.
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for, until the new CEO took over and changed things for the worse. He is closing stores, and eliminating positions (so far HR, assemblers, and FSA). He is a sorry excuse for a CEO. The store I work for, has absolutely pathetic management, and they bully you there. They also do not work with you, schedule wise. Also they do not appreciate anything you do there."
bad,"The new President of Lowe‚Äôs has brought everything crashing down. Positions were eliminated company wide without warning, causing hundreds of people to lose their jobs. Management doesn‚Äôt care about you or your job. They recently got rid of the security/asset protection position so people are stealing from the store left and right. There‚Äôs no flexibility to the schedule and no one is held responsible for their mistakes."
bad,I've been working for lowes for almost 2 years. Never have I had job any steady work with 5 hrs of work one week and 35 the next and Stone age computer systems
bad,"Most difficult retail work environment that I have ever worked in.  Department managers are constantly changing along with policies and procedures.  Quite a bit of bending, kneeling, climbing ladders and lifting involved in normal daily activities.  Typically, openers must perform safety checks and search for products to downstock empty shelf locations. This can be challenging when night stocking crew often puts top stock product in the wrong locations.  Closing associates must tidy shelves and downstock merchandise.  Customers make life hard by tearing open boxes to look inside (which must be ""repaired"" / taped shut), dropping unwanted merchandise everywhere and anywhere, and shop lifting is quite a big problem.  The most difficult part of the job is standing on your feet on a concrete floor for 8 plus hours a day, in addition to lifting, bending, and climbing to get products for customers and to replace purchased products on the shelves.  For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I actually get to assist customers with their needs.  Unfortunately, that is only about 10% of what we do as customer service associates."
bad,"I was actually excited to work in a big store like Lowes.  I assumed that since its a huge cimpany that they would have set proceedures in place for everything they did and there would be no guesswork at the rules.  I was right.  Went to a weeks worth of training where we learned all about safety, and how to properly stack skids and product on the shelves, how to use ladders properly and other things like that.  I was so happy.  However, within 2 minutes of my actual firat day I found out that they didnt follow any of the proceedures for safety i had learnt.  A supervisor was driving a forklift in a crowded space with a coffee in one hand and a bunch of paperwork against her chest.  I also saw employees climbing shelves to put product up high.  Also a manager came back after a break and reeked of weed.  Sooo many other examples.  Sad."
bad,Would not recommend lowes to anyone very unprofessional management is not professional.  Also they change their rules and policy‚Äôs whenever it‚Äôs convenient to the managers
bad,"This place is awful expect to be there play thing. They make you do unsafe jobs, I was hospitalized because of that. They will also steal money out of your paycheck, and make you work over dot hours. No origination and the managers act like children, also if you quit then they will give you a bad job refrence. Work here if you want but expect to be abused and robbed"
bad,"Since our new CEO took over, Lowe's has gone downhill fast.  Every day I here customers and employees complaining about the lack of help in each department. They used to pay well enough, but even that has changed. Senior associates are being cut on pay levels and jobs meant to be performed during the day are being bumped to overnights without compensation."
bad,"Very unorganized Company to be so large, management do not train employees properly, some employees would get by with unprofessional practices while on company time."
bad,"Lowe's has lost family owned tradition and principles of caring about its employees and is now managed by corporate wolfs with profits and share holders returns as only reason you will exist or be dismissed as a employee. American greed working at its finest, SAD VERY SAD!"
bad,"This place treats their employees horrible. There's favoritism, harrassment, and so many more lawsuits causing issues going on at Lowe's. They keep getting rid of positions, laying people off, and asking more of the people whose jobs haven't yet been terminated."
bad,Terrible head cashiers and managers. very demoralizing and negative work environment and attitudes.some customers can be very rude and management and leads will do nothing to support or even give you the training you need to do your job.
bad,There is no loyalty to long time employees who show up and work every day. Managers are constantly contradicting each other so employees are constantly being pulled in different directions. Understaffed is an understatement.
bad,Busted my ***for almost 15 yrs new transplants from closed store didn't  do their  job all kinds of safety issues made so me enemies  falsely  accused  of harassment fired no write up just FIRED so much for the no retribution  policy . Never a write up since 2006
bad,From the onset of this job I have been told both conflicting and outright false information regarding employment.  from being interviewed for a better position then what they offered me to being misled on how the schedule works.  Management is extremely weak and has no general idea what it is doing.  It can not do basic tasks like hiring and firing and reasonable scheduling.  The product knowledge of management is a joke and the atmosphere is extremely stressful and depressing.  There is no form of training beyond the first day of orientation.  don't bother asking management to show you how to do something you haven't done before because they won't know either.  The entire company seems to be heading in a bad direction that makes me question the possible longevity of my position.  Additionally job security is not something this employer can offer.  They have made 3 cuts to employees this year.  no amount of tenure or aptitude will make your job secure if corporate sets it's sights on you.  I have been working here 6 months and still have no clear idea on how to gain access to benefits I'm supposedly offered.  This job is for people with no more options left.  Lowes does not hire from within so don't expect to move up in this company.
bad,Working at lowe‚Äôs has not been fun. Managers don‚Äôt care enough for employees no recognition where it‚Äôs needed no sense of work ethic. I‚Äôve been working at lowe‚Äôs for 9 months and i regret it everyday. Unless you want to feel like you‚Äôre doing everything wrong then go right ahead...
bad,"Lowes spends billions on technology that never works to eliminate the people that did work. After they fired great managers and let go of their delivery team to hire a terrible 3rd party delivery service, I lost all respect for them and parted ways."
bad,Draconian workplace. Employees treated poorly even for a retail environment. Morning chant very demeaning. Management needs to treat employees with respect not just bodies filling a post.
bad,"Rules or jobs can be changed by any manager at any time. Makes you hard to feel good about anything. Managers can bind together to say anything about you. Store manager does not know the product or product placement. Requires others to cover for him,"
bad,Started with high expectations being a professional. That was a mistake. Company does not run like a well oiled gear with team working philosophy. More like s caveman‚Äôs life where you watch your bad for people that fear others that have more talent. Expect to kiss butt to get anywhere and be prepared to be talked down to as if your a uneducated moron. Thanks Dubuque store
bad,"From the store manager to  97% of the ASM's to Department managers and other people in positions of self given importance and power - LET THE BULLYING AND DEGREDATION BEGIN."
bad,The associates in the store are very disgruntled and speak openly about it‚Ä¶ The manager doing the interview was very disorganized. Initially it seemed like a good environment but the longer I waited for my interview the more I saw and heard Complaints about leadership and lack of help. People being let go yet they are hiring. Lowe‚Äôs in Shamokin Dam is a true train wreck.
bad,"In my year at working at Lowe‚Äôs, it was a mix of emotions. Sure, the customers can be crazy at times, but the love I felt from my coworkers outweighed the bad. What pushed me to leave (nearly on the spot) was management. We also were ALWAYS understaffed due to hiring freezes, especially during very crucial sales periods. A lot of managers also had the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre disposable‚Äù attitude and demanded respect, even if they weren‚Äôt acting in a respectable manner."
bad,"Great place to work at first , but a lot of changes and things have gone down hill. They have a hard time keeping and finding employees. The typical work day is always crazy it seems, or super dead. I feel like there is never enough help and employees have to cover more than one department. Management could do better with scheduling and trying to make it better place to work for it's employees and treat us better."
bad,If you like being treated like trash on a daily basis you should get a job here. You will get talked to like trash from the store manager any time he is actually in the building. Watch out for those write-ups. ASM and Above can do what ever they want and break every rule in the book. Everyone else ‚Äúbeware‚Äù. Got yelled down for being 5 minutes late back from work because of traffic from a store manager that takes on average 2 hours lunches every day. Must be nice to only have to work 30 hour weeks and get paid for 50. If you are good at your job be ready to be terminated . Run! The poor culture of this store makes it impossible to do anything with pride here. District manager backs the store manager no matter what even though he has been complained about over and over from every store he has been at for the same issues.
bad,"Please don‚Äôt apply here or to any Lowes, you‚Äôll regret it if you get hired. Training takes forever and then when they think ‚Äúyour done with training‚Äù, they‚Äôll throw you out to the floor/wolves with no mentor or someone to properly work here. The local customers are nice but when season hits ‚ÄúWatch out for bad attitude snowbirds ‚Äú"
bad,Management and field operations very disconnected.  Lack of leadership and support. Technology very outdated to process sales.  Store did not support Program
bad,Work like a dog not enough pay. Promised a position and never got it. No help worked receiving for a year by myself. Managers have their own click regular workers don't matter. Pay does not meet the amount of work you do.  Schedules change often most workers do not stay. They are for making money not about making employees happy. I found it is a negative place to work would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"They do not pay a living wage"
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for over 2 decades and in 2015 finally had enough and left.  No longer was it a company where loyalty and dedication were valued. I was paid to do a job and I did it well. I always had good reviews and met or exceeded expectations. However, the company became too political and I no longer could advance. In my final few years the company was just no longer enjoyable to work for...it was just a job and there was little to no direction on as what was going to be on the horizon. Lot's of good, smart people that I had grown to know were terminated due to longevity and ""no longer a fit with the future business model."""
bad,"Lowes has a very poor communications pathway. Often times I would get written up for something that was mentioned in meetings I was not privy to. To summarize, Lowe's takes people who care about there job, and beats them down until they don't care anymore. I'm not bitter about leaving, this is a matter of fact - that store cannot keep people working there."
bad,"It is not how it appears. The managers, such as store manager at my location only cares about the bottom line. It is sales driven and fears corporate."
bad,"Overall, this place is a joke.  All the managers throw work they don't want to do on the head cashier.  They are used and abused by the entire front end of the store, from cashiers, management, customers, etc.  Too much work, responsibility, and liability for no appreciation, poor pay, and the stress and mouth from everyone.  Never again!!"
bad,Yea there are alot of pros to working for them.   They are chipping away at all the benefits.  They do not care about the employees anymore.   The store mgr at the Mooresville store could give a rats butt about your life.   Never and I mean never said anything positive to us in delivery.  I‚Äôve seen and witnessed people that have relocated from out of state and the company just flat out fire them.  They say Barnum circus stopped.  They didn‚Äôt. They just go by Lowe‚Äôs now
bad,Management is a joke . They got upset when I explained to them the DOT regulations. And spent 2 days on the phone trying to prove me wrong .They would give you 10 deliveries and then ask why it took you 11 hours to do all your deliveries. Managers were bullies . They act like they are above you and don‚Äôt like it when you know more then they do .
bad,"I honestly hate being negative, but this was bad. It's everything a dying store can be. If you were a floor associate you gave all customers to the Department teams and Specialists who are already overworked and having their hours cut down to 39 a week so the company wouldn't pay their benefits on top of trying to make your own sales goals. And management was never on the floor despite their claims yet they were very much focused on micromanaging to the point where there was safety concerns"
bad,Lowes has gone through numerous changes and none of them benefit the employee. Stores are understaffed and employees are over worked to shore up the bottom line for the shareholders. Corporate employees are getting rich off of the backs of the store employees. Systems are very outdated which makes it difficult to complete daily tasks. No work life balance.
bad,Give them a -0 managers think they can talk to you any kind of way you won‚Äôt get respect like this they hired for seasonal 35 hours or more then cut hrs
bad,"Management  doesnt follow the rules each manager  has different  rules. You are not able to say no  and if you do they will hold it against  you. The company  vehicles   for Delivery  wouldnt  pass inspections  for Dot and could tell them till your blue in the face and  it wouldn't  matter your just a number  and it's always been about money . They dont care about  there employees.  I wouldnt  reccomend  people  to Lowes. The work schedule   is 10  to 15 plus hours,  have already got fined for working  over my 14 hr  rule."
bad,Would have been a nice place to work except for the rude and incompetent store manager.  He only wants younger people there. That is age discrimination.
bad,"Worked under unbelievably stressful conditions.  Pay was low, & management was lost. No cohesive management strategies. Worst place I have ever worked. Treated their employees like garbage"
bad,"Don't do it run very stressful job, and most locations have poor management. Management doesn't care if the trucks are broke, or won't pass dot inspection they won't fix it besides slapping a band aid on it.our truck got ran 9qtrs low on oil and fried the engine. They won't even let you do a walk around check in the morning without rushing off the yard. They pick the orders the same day they try to deliver them as muscle shoals and its a horribly inefficient. If you want to work for lowes make sure the store has good management. I was also physically threatened by a manager how professional that was. Good entry to get experience and move on nothing more."
bad,"I was not prepared for the structure change. So many things were done that were against regulations. Management was lacking to say the least. Favouritism was very common where customer service was not. I look at it like this, if they don't come in, I don't have a job.. It is pretty simple."
bad,Terrible management at the store level. Too much micro managing and not a ten atmosphere.  Not enough help on the sales floor. We were asked to run 95 percent of our payroll during the peak selling season. This meant we could not meet the customer demand. Consequently you had a lot of associates calling out and no one on the floor.
bad,Horrible store manager. Very unrealistic and has no college education and does not know how to read a P&L statement. Treats non management people poorly. It was a mistake for me to come work here. I should have done better due diligence before agreeing to come here.
bad,"Lowes is not nice if a employee themself or their family develop an illness. They will get rid of you, even if the employee is on fmla, your job is not protected."
bad,Our particular store is being ran on a skeleton crew. Our sales are incredibly good in spite of customers complaining every day that there is not enough help. The employees are stressed from the amount of demands being made on them. Management doesn‚Äôt seem to care.
bad,Don't work here unless it is the only option. The people are all nice but you will live in poverty uninsured unless you move up to management which is very hard to do. I applied for over 30 jobs to move up and did not ever move up.
bad,The better you are at your job the more you at taxed. Company does not care about your life or what extras you do for the company. I do not recommend working for Lowe's. However I use to love my job. But then I found out I have no control over it. Good luck
bad,Lowes store 0484 has poor management. They are rude to their employees and could care less about customer service. Management won't even help customers. Management is awful. It was no point in being it to the store manager with video of the management behavior towards employees because he didn't care.
bad,"Was bullied.   Management did nothing to stop it.   Was forced to leave"
bad,Manager and supervisors have their favorite employees they give their favorite employees hours and the rest of us suffer I was hired for part time when I first was tired I didn‚Äôt get hardly any hours when a supervisor was over the front and then when we got a new when I started getting at least 25 to 30 now I‚Äôm getting
bad,all they cared about is the numbers they always said one thing and did the  the way corp. wanted it done. the management had no guts to talk back to corp
bad,"The company is lost. No mission statement or purpose. No guiding philosophy. Corporate dictates one thing, then in action on store level it's opposite. Very contradictory, confusing, and annoying constantly in the middle of managers arguing. You will put out fires all day, never work the job you interviewed for, be lied to, and the hours and shifts are horrible. Nothing is ever set in stone, including your shifts. It used to be bearable to work for Lowe's but there was never reason or common sense applied to anything. Today, it's seriously an insane asylum with favoritism, lies, cover ups, etc all by bad managers and corporate doesn't care about any of it."
bad,interviewed 5 times for the exact position only for full time because i worked over 50 hours weekly but did not answer questions in interview right so was told i did not get fulltime position but still worked me over 50 hours weekly.
bad,I had a 75 dollar variance on my inventory and all I get was is that really correct ?from corporate if your looking to have a long career think before u say yes to any position j
bad,"They hire the bare min of workers so managers can get more money. You‚Äôll be doing your work times 100. No set schedules, so you‚Äôll be working morning, mid and night shift all in one week. Management is very poor."
bad,"a day at lowe's wasn't anything to brag about. I learned how to work a cash register, management was horrible, can never be found. The culture was bad, a lot of the co-workers talked about each other and they had attitudes. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowes was that I earned 3 months worth of experience."
bad,"I worked at the Moline Lowe's, the management there was a joke. Nobody knows what going on half the time and when they do finally find out it's at the last minute and if your job title is linked to it your going to get blamed. I've been there 6 months and still had no idea which manager was the one I reported to, when I asked I got different anwsers. If the people there don't like you they will make your work experience a living h@ll. It's basically like a high school, drama and gossip around every corner. Trust me stay away from this place"
bad,"The work environment was always ao"
bad,"Probably the most disappointing work experience I ever had.  Expecting Lowe's to be a fairly reputable company to work for, was nothing but a nightmare !   Management treat employees very badly, and no concern for employee morale whatsoever.  "
bad,"Management is prejudice and allows it to happen at all levels.  Have clicks among the management staff and if you are not a part of the click you are out of a limb with no support, Find petty things to write up .  Complaints go on deaf ears."
bad,"They refused to give me a day off to visit my dying grandmother. I was told I was ""Sorry about your grandmother but you are too new to request any time off"" despite working there just over 3 months. I had never been late or missed a shift. Hours were not consistent at all. A couple months into the position they did not write me in on the schedule for 8 whole days. Management is very cold and rude. I went to clock out at 5 as my shift was over, a manager told me and said I was scheduled until 5:30. She then checked the schedule and realised she was wrong. Instead of apologizing she said ""oh, 5:00"" and walked away."
bad,"There is absolutely no work/home life balance. You can work 8 - 15 hour days and it is still not enough. The company shows signs of lack luster leadership throughout the higher end of its chain. Once you hit store management, politics really come into play. Corporate was made aware, and chose to do nothing to stop it. It's very disheartening for someone that pours their soul into their work."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs has managed to make the majority of their employees wish they had never stepped  foot in the place. It‚Äôs a good ole boys club and if you want to advance you better be in good with the manager. "
bad,Lowes was a great place to work when I started but has since degraded into a hostile environment where managers are dictators who delegate their way out of having to do any real work while the average employee is more overburdened each day and schedules are always different each week leading to no family time.
bad,The management motto at the store I came up in was ‚Äúthe beatings will continue until the morale improves‚Äù. The schedule for most of the departments is ridiculous. They allow no work home life balance. I was there eleven years and feel like I was a visitor in my family‚Äôs lives. They used to have a decent bonus structure but they did away with it.
bad,I was let go because of a manager that didn't like me.  She was all about making your life miserable.  I lost my 12 year career cause of her.  I hope Karma gets her!!!!
bad,The management is only there because they have been there for years. Unless you kiss butt or sleep with a manger don‚Äôt even think about going up the managerial ladder. They fire anyone who makes them look bad. And if you miss 3 days in a row and have a doctors note they will still fire you.
bad,I try my best to meet everyone goals for me at work however it doesn't seem it works at all and it seems just a job you work for a bit then leave not to happy with my experience co workers were nice management and customers can get nasty
bad,"First day spent ""training"" on computer modules. At the end of my first day I met my department manager who told me I was to go to Vestal NY (1 hour 10 minute drive) at 8am the next day. I called the next morning to explain that I could not go based on the very little info I had on it. Department manager was devoid of understanding on what a big ask that was on my second day at the job. I did not see much of the department manager until the following week when she rudely ordered me around in the morning and kept telling me to do things while I was trying to complete the tasks she just told me to do. When I tried to stick up for myself she fired me without actually telling me why. I think she was planning on firing me before I even got there. I can only speculate as to why she had it out for me. "
bad,"mangement is a joke, tons of favoritism. NO TRAINING AT ALL... wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a job.  they talk it up in the interview..."
bad,Working for Lowe's had its ups and downs. like any other job. Unfortunatley withthe new management that have come in their views have been skewed. They are no longer looking for the long term employee thye instead want the fresh out of school or in school people. which leaves customer's frustrated when they don't know anything about what they are doing and need that advice.
bad,"Pay is no longer enough to keep me there, there is no longer any work life balance. Management is incapable of keeping story straight, does not support employees"
bad,"Until They Get Rid Of the store manager , that store will never change. All about favorites . Alot of backstabbing people. Poor management. The only time management cares about you is when the district manager comes for a visit. I became very depressed they pushed me to put in my 2week notice."
bad,"Exploits ""false hope"" from predominantly young employees who have not been deceived by a company before. Verry poor pay considering how much money Lowe's has. The WORST micro-management I have personally seen. First department I worked for ""repairs"", got completely let go and Lowe's was considerate enough to transition all of us in the/my department into CPO. Lowe's is a dying dinosaur, who has a lot of old pups sucking on a dying tit until there is not a drop of milk left. The people they promote are a joke. The most difficult part about this job is the micro-management. The physical building we worked in, in Wilkesboro, is very nice but does not come close to making up for all the other stuff. They also have a very good cafeteria with good food and reasonable prices. That was my favorite part about that place, that I didn't have to leave for lunch, which saved a lot of time. Not a place for a career in my opinion. Maybe 20 years ago."
bad,"Depending on the department you are in will decide your life there. If it's a score based department like recieving,  shipping or building you are easily replaceable. Though appliance people can do what they want. They walk people out all the time. They dangle the bonus in front of you but keep making it more difficult for you to get. The people who have been there a long time know how to work the system to keep their score up. The bosses dont care if you cheat as long as you dont get caught. High scores make them look good. Also they push safety but make impossible standards unless you cheat and NEVER report a damaged item. If you get hurt, its your fault and will get written up. If you are in maintenance you can literally get caught sleeping on the job and not get fired. Coaches get bonuses based on things like your score and the lack of off standard time they give you. Some of the coaches are awesome, most are just trying to keep their head off the chopping block."
bad,I worked as a load puller for lowes I was told in my interview that I would be helping load the trucks and help pull for the next day. Turns out ya you will be loading trucks and pulling for the next day by yourself and if anything is messed up in delivery even if it is not your fault it is in fact your fault. They make it sound so great to work there but it is a complete mess the worse warehouse I worked in treated me better than this place. Heaven forbid if you get sick because you have to call into the store and hope you get a manager before you have to be there. In defense of Lowes there are some managers that will help you out and own up to there mistakes.
bad,"Need a quick job to get by on until the next best thing comes along? Lowe's would be good for you. Want to make a long term career out of it? Don't even bother. I would have told you differently 5 years ago. I used to think Lowe's was a great place to work and give my time. They really brainwashed me into thinking that we were there for the people and the community - but that is no more. It kind of feels like we're liquidating like JC Penny and we are on our way to be stripped down to an Amazon lumber distribution site. Lowe's constantly harps on trying to beat Home Depot, but the upper management mindset will continue to keep this from happening. Lowe's continues to cut employees and add ""busy work"" to who is left - do more with less is the current mindset. Way less."
bad,"The management is some of the worst I have ever seen, there is no advancement, the pay is kind of decent, and the work load is immense for the time period they want it done in, and the amount they pay you for it. They make up false excuses to fire you and write you up, the management will bully you out of the store if they don't like you, and they will never let you advance up in the store. They always will hire externally for advanced positions. "
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs used to care about its employees but has gradually let corporate greed take over and now only cares about CEO‚Äôs and shareholders. I have worked for them for the past 11 years and have seen many changes, all negative. We used to get bonuses from goals we could actually achieve, commissions, bigger discounts on purchases (special order), inventory bonuses, Christmas bonuses. We had manager training programs and managers that valued hard work, punctuality, reliability, and people that stayed more than a year. That has all gone by the wayside now. Lowe‚Äôs is now a big box, corporate, Home Depot wannabe, that only wants a skeleton staff for as little as they can pay them. They aren‚Äôt interested in keeping knowledgeable, experienced workers because they cost too much. They continue to shift the cost of benefits from employer to employee on an annual basis, so you never really get a raise. They did away the ESOP plan. They restructure lower and middle management every five years or so to eliminate positions of people that have been there for a while and moved up in position/pay. You are then forced to take a lower paying position or be terminated, not because you did anything wrong, but because you have become too expensive. Then a couple of years later they will switch back to the same management structure that was working with lower paid employees. The only exception to this cycle is if you are a brown noser extraordinaire, then you may be looked out for by the surviving senior managers that were themselves brown nosers. Ask anyone who has worked for Lowe‚Äôs more than 10 years"
bad,The store that I worked at was very unprofessional with the way they allow the management to handle most situations such as scheduling and time off that may be an Emergency.
bad,Was a flooring spacailist at store 1854 the management thier was a joke constantly being throw to the wolfs evertime a unreasonable customer crys they just give them whatever they want i had a customer come in and was looking for gule down vinyl plank  i told him we didnt have any in stock and that it was super expensive compaired to the floating vinyl planks and that they take about 3 weeks to get here the customer cuzzed me out for 30 mins i tryed to tell a member of management that i needed help but they were all in a meeting and couldnt be bothered with sales floor related bussiness i went back to the desk to clock out and the man threatened me his exact words to me were im gunna slap the fire outta you witch he screamed in my face i let my temper get the better of me for all of 2 seconds and said the f bomb 2 times before i even realized it came out of my mouth when mangement finnaly did show up to help the customer had already left and they told me i had done the right thing that was monday they fired me friday with no warning didnt tell my manger didnt give me any hint that my job was being looked at for termantion and on top of everything treated me like i had pooped in their cereal when i did everthing but begg for thier help none of their empolyes know anything about the products they sell and will lie to you to get u to spend money their a money hungry company that are trying to move up to the 21st century and update thier 1970s computer systems everything that u put in the computer had to be done in 2 different programs nobody knows how to use thier installed sales
bad,"You struggle on your own in this company, the managers do not know anything except to blame you for any mistake that they have done. They will call you stupid behind your back and will never help you with anything. There is no HR on site to help you with complaints or issues."
bad,Managers showed favoritism towards other co workers that they like and already knew outside of work place. I would never work that Lowe‚Äôs again after the way I was treated.
bad,"Just don't do it.  I hated every minute there, management was very poor.  The hours were terrible, I would open one day close the next and vice versa.  The training was nonexistent."
bad,"If you‚Äôre thinking about working at Lowe‚Äôs go ahead and slap yourself in the face for considering it. Sure the pay is good but the place in general is a joke and I worked there for a year and 7 months which is truly unfortunate. The managers do not care about you minus maybe 2 I worked for. They act like they‚Äôre your friend but as soon as you walk away from them they immediately start talking horribly about you and I know this because I was told by a manager I was close with which was only one the whole time. The scheduling is utterly ridiculous and if you actually have a life then do not work there, they are constantly letting people go and it screws over the ft employees. Working your way up into better positions is impossible unless you like to kiss butt to everyone so if that‚Äôs you then go ahead and do it. All in all though... it‚Äôs a absolutely terrible place to work and I wouldn‚Äôt consider it to my worst of enemies..."
bad,"If you like sucking up to whining contractors, ungrateful customers and a ""customer is always right"" management then this is the place for you.  No job is worth the garbage you have to deal with in retail.  IT IS RETAIL!  If you think that working here is as good as it gets then good for you.  If a customer complains, management sides with customer, regardless of the truth.  Customers  play the race card and win.  They fire the elderly and deny them unemployment benefits.  Then get forced to pay after going to court.  I was hired and wanted to get into management.  After literally 2 days I changed my mind.  Not to sound arrogant, but my brain is wired differently then to put up with managers getting caught giving a bj in shipping, another manager accusing me in front of others that I smelled like pot. Human resources said they take the side of right.  They take the side of safe and hang employees out to dry.  Worst company ever,"
bad,"The management at my store places profit margin and his salary at the top of his priority list. Customers who complain get what they want, making the employees look incompetent. The vast majority of employees are men & receive the most promotions. Moral is very low; most seasoned employees quit or went to another store. Only good parts of this job are the benefits and friendships with other employees. Salary is horrendously low; if I retire at 70 after working there for 16 years, I will finally make $15 hour. I would not recommend anyone work at Lowe's."
bad,"Management sucks,  had favortite workers doing nothing everyone else busted butt.   There were a few GOOD managers , but this year was the year of women in charge, and did a sucky job."
bad,"Management is completely out of touch with what is realistically possible within a single shift. They will put a single employee with no training into a department they know nothing about and expect them to handle everything.This is one of the highest trafficked stores in the country and we're talking handling customer inquiries, putting away returns, cleaning and organizing the department as well as creating and following up on leads for install projects every single day. They also love to ask you to stay extra time while they deny all overtime requests as well as most vacation requests. All without any proper training and definitely without any appreciation. The only good thing at this job is the coworkers as when I was there they were the most real people you'll ever meet."
bad,"they oly keep you until they need you.i worked there for over 10 years,and then they decided to go to a third party for flatbeds delivery.i would have stayed ,but i was told i would be taking about a 9.00-dollar-cut an hour in my pay-rate."
bad,"Technology, old, old old.  Lowe's keeps adding more ""new programs"" to their ancient base system, instead of updating to a new system altogether.  It's like having a car that needs a new engine, but you decide to put in new upholstery instead.  Looks great, but it's not going anywhere.  Example:  Lowes.com was down on Black Friday, but management offered nothing to help, no work arounds, no idea when it would be back up.  If you say anything about problems, you are branded as negative and a trouble maker."
bad,"I have never been fired from a job in my life and I have had many jobs. One day, they called me in the office and let me go with no explanation. I am a hard worker. My dad was dying and I missed a couple of shifts (you‚Äôd think they would be understanding.) In all honesty, the night crew was a tight knit group and it was hard to break into that and become friends. I think they threw me under the bus to get rid of me. The 2 female night crew supervisors are too young, and they are useless! Very unfriendly, except of course, with their friends. I worked hard, did everything I was supposed to do and beyond. I would not recommend Lowe‚Äôs. Besides, the wages are laughable!! I would like to sarcastically thank all of the night crew for an awkward, unfriendly, and back stabbing environment!"
bad,No coverage management not friendly. If you like being bullied and overworked this is the place for you. They expect you to bow to them and work with no encouragement and all they do is look down on you and criticize you.
bad,"I saw them many times over the years promote someone and then fire them within a few weeks."
bad,hours do not reflect a corporate office. the only people that move up are friends and family. nepotism. overall the job will pay the bills. with the new CEO lots of great changes are happening.
bad,"Management is terrible. All they do is walk around together and talk to each other. They need to be better trained. They have employees that have been there forever with the worst attitudes, that makes it a bad environment to work."
bad,"let's start with management...."
bad,When I first started we had a good manager and excellent assistant store managers. After a shakeup in top management things changed drastically. They fired most of the experienced assistant store managers and reassigned department managers into areas they had no knowlege of. Then they went with cheaper un-experienced floor managers. Lowes stated to tank and is continuing to do so. It was a shame because my store was functioning brilliantly up to that point and went into a disfunctional tailspin that they still cannot recover from. I hear they are now going back to the original sales floor model but so many experienced staff has been hurt financially that I can't see a return to function any time soon.
bad,"Would be a decent place to work if they did things by merits instead of who kisses up to the managers the most. The saying who you know not what you know applies to this company. Management is always changing and always doing something different from the previous management. This makes the company inconsistent with how it wants to operate and how it treats its employees. This intern makes the culture have a ""every man for himself"" feeling. There is no loyalty what so ever."
bad,"A lot of drama between all the cashiers, managers use you and will do their best to fire you if they don't like you. Managers make up lies to make you look bad and would use the smallest excuse to write you up. "
bad,"Having worked in two stores, the first one I worked in was fantastic, the store manager was a great guy, all of the ASMs were great, although some had their flaws. Having said that, moving to a new store, I was shocked and appalled at how poorly the store was managed, and how bad employees were treated."
bad,Been there 5 years. Not much moving up. Management plays favorites to employees and gives them best positions. Hours suck never have a set schedule to plan any activities with family or friends
bad,"Great customer interaction, poor management. Scheduling can be an issue. Pay is great but I‚Äôd prefer Home Depot. They are more focused on the well being of the associate and value entrepreneur like thinking."
bad,"Complete waste of time.  They promote former store associates to run a ""call center"", with no formal training.  They treat everything like a retail store.  Senior leadership is a joke.  Blind leading the blind."
bad,"Management and associates do not follow the job descriptions, requirements and qualifications for the position they are in."
bad,"Worked for S.W. Augusta, Ga. Lowe‚Äôs. Everything from the top down was exactly what I was NOT looking for in a ‚Äújob‚Äù. Hours/pay were/was inconsistent with what was initially discussed when offered the position (CSA), managers were absolutely lacking in effort, efficiency, professionalism, as well as knowledge. I felt like an overachiever just by showing up. I was fifteen minutes early every shift, but there was nothing about that that made sense to anyone else there. (Simple: if I‚Äôm not fifteen minutes early, I‚Äôm already late. A concept lost to these kids who ran the store.) I saw no chance to grow beyond the litter box, and was literally lied to about my hours to be worked. They offered 40+/wk., and I was told consistently that I needed to get off the clock early, leading to approximately 17/28 hours/wk. Customer service and satisfaction was completely nonexistent. That may have disgusted me the most, and was their number one complaint. (Internal ratings averaged 37% customer satisfaction, per the post-sale surveys.) It was a blessing to be laid off from this store..."
bad,While the company stresses great customer service. They really don't seem to know what great customer service is.  Many employees really don't care about the customer.  They may be trained for great customer service.  The implementation of their training is lost once they walk out of the training room door.  Managers complain in front of customers.
bad,Not the best places to work if your trying to make a career out of it. They lie to you on a daily basis and there‚Äôs no team work.  Managers arent reliable and they promise you things but at the end of the day it‚Äôs always a let down.
bad,"Unless you come in as a manager, then you are likely only part time.  They slash hours with no notice and your paycheck fluctuates based on sales.  This is a job for a student or someone that just wants some extra money.  Not an ideal company to count on to pay your bills."
bad,The reason why I'm saying Lowe's is the worst place to ever work for is the simple fact they take me out of assembly to put me in the paint department after the three guys I was working with back in assembly left I was the only GOOD one in there and that was said by all the employees that I worked with.
bad,Manager don't back up their workers. The best thing was working witty the customers and the co workers got along . The management didn't commute with there workers about new rules
bad,I got  blood clots in my legs from being on a standup forklift 50+ hours a week. No advancement opportunities. They don't expect people to last long and then are eager to get rid of you when you do last because they think you get paid too much.
bad,"The management team is useless. The hours suck, the work/life balance is nonexistent. No proper training on the equipment used. No product training (disassembly of refrigerators, because every brand is different). No communication whatsoever in the workplace. No safety equipment, the delivery vehicle is not kept up to par, no proper tools for the job. Unrealistic expectations of the drivers, unrealistic time frames for large appliance deliveries. Just a terrible place to work for."
bad,"Everything is done based on favoritism and discrimination. Breaks and lunches are switched around depending on what the""favorites"" like. management/head cashiers look down on all other workers making the environment a lot more hostile than what it should be."
bad,"selling appliances all day pulling appliances, cashier, a lot about their computer system and equipment work, and a lot of appliances, it was a very immature workplace culture, being overworked with no help, and no direction or training , I enjoyed most of my coworkers, bad management"
bad,"It seems the lazy employees get away with everything, gossip like high schoolers, poor lazy management. No teamwork or communication. Management stays hidden in the office and when they have to do anything it‚Äôs an inconvenience. No appreciation for hardworking employees."
bad,"As a Manager at Lowe's you were required to work around 60 hours a week.  In my role as Human Resources Manager, I managed around 180 employees alone while performing every function of HR.  This was very difficult."
bad,Don't work for lowes unless you have no other choice. i don't have anymore to say i not there anymore. i wouldn't recommend working for this company i do not have nothing else to say
bad,Terrible place to work if you're an adult with bills to pay and self respect. They treat their employees like dirt. I would only recommend if you're a teenager.
bad,Management is terrible. The hours are cut so much and employees can't help the customers. Managers don't support the employees because any issues managers dodge customers.
bad,"No comment, Except I expected more training and communications from management. Most of my coworkers were friendly, and helpful. There were opportunities for good discounts"
bad,Lowes took two years of my life. I put my heart and sweat into this job and they only took from me. Took them over a year to promote me even though new positions were created because of the work I'd done. The environment was extremely hostile.
bad,"One needs to be a management favorite or belong to a clique for advancement. Work ethics, dependability, performance, experience and tenure has no value. Spiteful actions take place too much. Not a healthy work environment especially toward stress and anxiety. I am indifferent and don't really care to be a contributor here"
bad,"Cliques in each dept made fitting in and doing your job as taught uncomfortable most of the time. While my hours were steady, expectations weren't and depended on which longer term employee was working with me under which manager, Favorites among managers were very obvious,and uncomfortable."
bad,"When I first started. Lowe's was a nice place to work.  Over the years, it changed dramatically.  Hostile environment at times, and way too much drama. I did enjoy my customers, and some of my co-workers. Nothing really hard about the job, but it was fun learning all the new things about Customer Service. I do like what the Company is all about, just wish they had better managers."
bad,Never go to delivery you  will regret it I promise. Management doesnt care they get to go home on time and we end up getting the shaft.  It is a giant unorganized mess.
bad,They had no control over their employees.  The Main store manager was sexually harassing most of the women and the store turnover rate is unbelievable.
bad,Lowe's was not a good place for me to work. I did not like most of the people I worked with. I was one of the few people willing to actually do some work there.
bad,"I worked my behind off for them for almost 10 years. It‚Äôs all politics and who does what with who for a promotion.  If they want you gone or a manager hates you or you make too much, they will make up an excuse to fire you and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it."
bad,"there is no communication, it is like being in high school people get promoted by how popular they are not by their job performance or experience, the managers act like they are better then the other employees"
bad,"I honestly don‚Äôt like the management here, they have lack of communication and over work their employees. A lot of people have left from this place amd found better job offers with better pay."
bad,This company no longer cares about its employees at all. It is solely about selling people anything. They no longer employ any one knowledgeable about anything they sell. Sad to see this company fall on its face so hard.
bad,"This is not a place for a person to work if they want a stable life and future. If you do work here or are thinking of working here . I doubt you are wanting to stay any longer. And if you aren't feeling this way that probably means they are treating you nice and are about to""let u go"" as they say."
bad,"Management seems content to sit in their office or at customer service and not manage anyone.  Hard workers get extra work loads loaded on them while slackers get away with doing nothing with no repercussions.   Raises are based on corporate and have nothing to do with how hard you work or how much you get done, and they are usually very low (worked there for close to 5 years and never got anything above a 20 cent raise).  There is no room for advancement as they slashed almost all management positions and consolidated them into 6 or 7 management positions that are suppose to cover 3-4 department each.  The only good thing about this job was the benefits but they came at a hefty cost which would cut your salary almost in half if you elected to receive them."
bad,Company going through major changes. Trying to find way to future. Company preaches customer service but scheduling one associate per department per day won't get job done. Limited compensation with no raises nor bonuses is a problem. Inexperienced managers is another problem.  Turn over is another problem.
bad,"Management are not leaders, rather bullies, they prefer bad employees over good ones...a lot of favoritism towards long time employees, treat everyone like a thief, if you complain about something you're considered a problem employee, Head cashier's act as managers, outdated system, scanners that don't work, backstabbing employees and managers, riddled with gossip, short staffed,  and major employee turnover...however, if you mention anything to HR, your told, ""it's all in your head"", ""your making this up!"" OH, and not to mention, but I've caught managers spying on me!! Totally crazy!! Everyone feared losing their jobs, no job security...."
bad,Don't work here unless you are desperate. Degrading atmosphere and no management or accountability.  Understaffed. No one wants to do their job leaving you with more work than you signed on for.
bad,"Compared to the Home Depot, this company is way behind and horrible. I should have done more research before taking the job. I found out they got rid of department managers and other middle management when I started working in Kingston my first store and felt so out of place and left out by majority of my own management team.I was hired as a ‚Äúbench‚Äù or a floater in other words, and they did a bad job training me. Then I transferred to the Newburgh store where I still work at but looking for another job. They throw you into the wolves with little training and get told you have to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù. Employees feel overwhelmed and you want to help them but asms and store manager give you other work to do with little time to get it done on time. I also heard rumors of them possibly getting rid of more asms, the hr managers and specialists and recently got rid of the sos/credit coordinator position. I stepped down and even if i wanted to move up the job isnt secure since this company keeps downsizing!  The pay is not worth the stress and you have to run the whole store when you‚Äôre scheduled by yourself. Also this company doesnt even do christimas parties outside the store they do it at either receiving or training room while employees are working. We do little fun activities and everyone is always unhappy, unfriendly and unapproachable. DO NOT WORK HERE THIS IS NOT A CAREEER!"
bad,No Managment support  and two few employees on the floor. Poor employee training.  Very little employee intervention allowed - do it their way or the highway.
bad,At first I thought this job was pretty good but over the years management has gotten worse and worse. The company is going through corporate changes. üëéüèª
bad,"This company has no transparency, if you have new ideas, it will not be received well.  Lowe's wants to evolve but does not want to make a wave in the ocean in order to do that."
bad,management sucks. they promote whoever they want. lots of favoritism. hire to fire. Also there's always one cashier available at night. Little to no staff in the departments so customers can't get the adequate help that they need. The store used to be way better when i got hired (2012)
bad,The management was terrible. They never backed the employees. They believe that the customer is always right. The employees were abused by the customers and we had no one above us to help.
bad,Company is trying hard to beat Home Depot while following in their past footsteps with cuts of higher paid more experienced associates.  Staffing on the floor is very sparce and does not follow their core value of customer service.
bad,"Lowes is a company that lacks initiative, they follow the market and their competitors, leaving the employees behind.  They cut hours or jobs, and expect the same amount of work to be completed.  Aside from that the daily tasks and management procedures are flawed and filled with judgement and sometimes harsh repercussions.  The benefits that made this a once great company are all but gone.  This job will give you a paycheck that barely covers the basics, stress that carries over into your personal life, and daily headaches usually revolving around a manager looking over your shoulder waiting for you to complete a task that never seems to be good enough."
bad,"I don‚Äôt enjoy working here. To many hours, and I feel like they only care about sales and not about the life of the workers. Delivery is terrible. I hate it"
bad,Lacked intelligent leadership.  Childish HR manager.  Would not allow good employees to advance to better positions.  Expected you to be able to do your job plus 3 other peoples.  Stingy with bonuses.  Don't expect to work your best and hardest for Lowes and get anywhere.  Insurance was outrageous and overpriced.
bad,"Micro manage, mngr doesn‚Äôt know departments nor job duties of other mange‚Äôs etc lost in the headlights, mgrs treat employees lousy in front of others at daily meetings, lots of soap opera drama unprofessional"
bad,I really didn't like working at lowe's the management is poor and they work employees way to hard. The employees had no corporate support. It was just a stressful place.
bad,Lowes is going through a shake up and is trying to fire everyone possible and use only part time people.  The management is cowering in fear.  I was harassed and forced out of the position I was hired for.  Runaway.
bad,I would pull order for the day and the next day. I would wright schedule for my team and I would deal with customer issues and solve them my self somtime .
bad,"Store Teams care, but Market Director and above don't. Lowe's says it stands for its values, but clearly does not. Market Director and others will ask and expect you to do immoral tasks.... when you say ""No"", you will be black balled."
bad,"Not sure about other locations, but the McComb Store management was poor at best.  If you are part time don‚Äôt count on being moved to full time. Not a place you want to make a career. Don‚Äôt count on other employees to learn their departments. Their are some great people that work there, but most managers are unqualified for their required duties."
bad,Not a good place to work. Completely bad and uncaring management. Applied for inter company positions a dozen times received 1 interview and no position. Unless your in the  management clic there is no chance for upward mobility. I am sorry to say I wasted three years of my life working for this company.
bad,Other than the co-workers the place went down hill the last 5+ years.  The pay is less than competitive with other facilities starting at a rate close to the top rate.  The schedule is nice with having 3 days off till overtime starts then you have no choice but to work an extra day from March until July.  Management has no idea what they are doing and has turned a good place to work into a nightmare.
bad,I do not recommend working at Lowes. You will be a slave to the corporate scheduling. There is no work life balance and the Management treat you lower than dirt!
bad,"Lowes is a company that actually promotes from with-in, the problem with this is everyone will throw you under the bus , lie, cheat and steal just to get promoted. The managers change so often that you never know who to talk to and depending on the manager you may just get told to figure things out on your own, just to let you know what ever you do will be wrong and that manager will write you up for not coming to them."
bad,Very poor communication from store manager down. Very little job specific training for the position. Employees did as little as possible and were allowed to get away with it.
bad,I worked for Lowe‚Äôs about a year and a half evidently corporate that it was fun to keep playing games with there employees by doing away with certain positions and by the way most that they did away with were the high paying positions not to mention they have such a high turnover rate because of the way the store managers and upper management when we needed people the most they would always drag there feet and take atleast 6 months to hire somebody I can‚Äôt mention how many times I‚Äôve worked and had to cover my dept and 4 others because they had nobody scheduled but management doesn‚Äôt care just throw it on you and do the best you Can when you have livid  customers that have to wait forever for help because there isn‚Äôt anybody to help them
bad,"Do not recommend to anyone. Racist hiring and promoting. If you are white do not apply. "
bad,After returning to work at the company for three summers in a row I found out that less experienced employees that I was training were paid more than me.
bad,"Terrible managers. Store constantly understaffed."
bad,"Very cut throat, the corporate culture generated back stabbing, a the lack of support for the workers, with management types climbing over the worn out shells of the disposable workers."
bad,Store is severely understaffed. Employees are expected to cover multiple departments and work wherever they are needed or whenever they are needed. Management continuously is shuffled around and no one really knows what they are doing.
bad,The management team didnt care of the employees so long as the sales were met as this reflected their bonus.  No support from management. Employees were out to push sales as this effected their pay. No sales  equaled no pay.
bad,"Terrible managerial skills leads to poor working conditions,  unrealistic work loads, little to no training, poor scheduling, team work is frowned upon and almost non existent"
bad,I loved it. it was a lot of fun. Felt like family. Management and co-workers were all cool. Even the customers that came in were easy to deal with and chill.
bad,Company shift to shareholder profits only & no longer values employees which deteriorated store cultures affecting ultimately service to customers. Do not recommend as a good employer. Issues very bad for the south area.
bad,Senior Management does not mentor those who want to move. They call all day while sitting in the office all day. Literally all day. Service managers do the duties of assistant manager while not being paid to do so.
bad,"The environment at Lowe's is very cut throat."
bad,"Poor pay and no opportunities to advance. New attendance policy is too restrictive. Starting next year you get 7 attendance violations and you are fired. For example, clocking in or out outside the six minute window or calling in sick. Managers operate based on fear."
bad,Lowe's was a good place to work when I started there however over the years it became not so nice. Management would tell you one thing then do something else. The LOWE'S culture is just constantly changing and the Management does not care at all about the employees. Everyone is replace able at any level. Stay away from Lowe's as an employer.
bad,"When it comes to management or promotions they do not look to their current staff nor do they look for experience. They simply parade their buddies up or in. Their basis of position interviews is  based on the interview. If you are a first class bull******* , this is a career for you. If your a hard working individual that shows what your made of and that you are good at what you do and have experience, then keep moving. They will put you where they want you and that is where you stay. Even if there are multiple issues with a certain manager and you go up the ranks with multiple people about said management, they tell others they think your being too harsh. Store levels are full of management that has severe vaginitis. They cant take constructive critissism and will shut you down if you provide a positive solution."
bad,no work life balance.  and no able to advance.  I enjoyed learning new things from different areas of the store.  Was very high stress when it came to what was asked of management.
bad,The title states it all. Bad culture and poor management lends to bad returns. This is clearly seen in the stock performance of the company. The CEO is worthless and needs to be removed along with many of the Managers that are still in this company.
bad,They are a terrible company. I was with them for 9 years. They overheard a conversation through a work phone that I had pocket dialed someone. They brought me into the office and said they heard an inappropriate work conversation. They wouldn't tell me what was said. Stay away.
bad,They didn't train me how to do my job then they became angry I wasn't doing it. I did all I could to help. I went out on the floor they didn't want me on the floor so I spent my time resurfacing the floor of receiving and sitting in a chair.
bad,"Good company/ Bad management! management does not have the skills to deal with drivers, most of them have never driven commercially nor do they know the rules of the road.  Delivery for most are 12 to 15 hours a day.  Not organized, drivers have to pull there own load.  truck is never ready for delivery.  Most drivers get to work at 6 in the morning don't leave store until 9 sometimes 10.  You don't have time to take a lunch break and they really don't care, just want all merchandise off truck."
bad,Everyone who works at the Lakewood wa location cannot stand the store manager. She's super rude. Many good managers quit because of her while I was working there. My direct manager never got anyones schedule right... I've never seen a manager so bad at making a schedule... Lowe's also restructured so they laid off a lot of managers.. maybe it was better before but not a good place to work now.
bad,Worked there ten years.  Saw them go from a great company with oppertunities to grow to an oppressive employer looking for any reason to fire most employees making above minimum wage.  They will treat you like dirt.  They somehow love lazy workers.
bad,"Very stressful. They could care less about you. They'll throw you into things you don't want to do and say it's mandatory and that everyone has to do it but you'll be the only one doing it. I applied for part time but had 40 hours every week so that was annoying. The shifts are 9 hours, and that includes an hour unpaid lunch. Working here was just an overall annoying experience and I definitely would not recommend it to anyone. You can't leave the building on your 15 minute break. The pay was amazing, best paying job ive had. But even that wasn't enough to keep me from quitting. That's probably why they pay so well because if not everyone would quit."
bad,My experience at Lowes was no good. The management was horrible. They always messed up my time card and would put that people were absent when they were not. They do not care about their employees at all and its better to work somewhere where you feel comfortable and not miserable.
bad,"What Lowe's has done is find a way to beat the system and use employees to the max and provide the very least. Instead of hiring 5 new full time or part time employees they hire 5 temp workers every 4 months or so because they don't have to pay temp workers benefits and they slash your hours until you're forced to quit so you aren't able to draw unemployment. They cheat the system to keep the bottom line low and profits high and employees suffer. Notice how they always have a ""Now Hiring"" sign outside."
bad,"Nothing but rude and unhelpful coworkers. New management setup has limited help even more. Very few peers do all their job requires them to do. Bad hours, schedule always gets messed up, never any help when it is needed, overall stressful and miserable work."
bad,The first 3 years I felt as if I were finally home. Then Lowes became Walmart and got rid of best(paid) managers and employees and hired young mgmt that can't manage themselves. Customer service now stinks. They have the market so they don't care! Terrible work environment now
bad,I was horribly lied to when I was hired. In delivery you have no home life. They overload the trucks sending you out on 11 deliveries and expect you to do all this in 8 hrs. You will work 10-13 hr days and they constantly mess up your schedule. Management is all about money and not about you. Oh and did I mention they send you out on deliveries without hook ups you need for customers appliances? Yep! Then your stuck trying to calm down an angry customer who already hates Lowe's. Kudos!
bad,"the job is good. The management only worries about how to make more money for themselves. when I made bonus pay, they changed the qualifications. when I made it again they changed only something in my job to delay us from making the bonus. when I still made the bonus. I was fired for a small error. They want you to work fast but only as fast as you can without making the slightest error. It is only cost you 1.50 an hour worked for working slow."
bad,Lowes as a company is moving in a very associate unfriendly direction. All new positions are hired on a part time basis and there is little to no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"all around a poor place to work. management do not work with you on a schedule if you have another job or attend school. they also always ask more of you and give nothing in return not even so much as a ""good job champ"". and no matter how many things or areas you cover and no matter how good of a worker you are they is no room for advancement to even a full time position."
bad,"Poor hours, changing schedules with little notice.  Management personnel substandard and probably wouldn't be successful in any professional setting. Managers should spend time training employees to do things correctly, instead of trying to catch people doing something wrong."
bad,"Lowes was a great place to work. Friendly staff, customers and enviroment but I quickly learned other wise. The management at madisonville lowes is very self centered. They only care about the sale rates and their own benefits. I've never worked for a more back stabbing company. If you are looking to have good relations at work and enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend this job."
bad,"Overvorked, no help from menagement.No time for brakes.Menagers do nat care if you did not have lunch brakes.Undestafed,no customer help.To much menaging & little support from menagement.Menagers do not care about employis,it is impossible to get any help & support from them.Very difficult please to fully dedicate your self to customer.There is to much things expected from one person to do in 8 hours."
bad,"store managers out of touch with the teams, they come and go as they please and makes sure sr team covers for him  atleast that's how it is at store I was at"
bad,"Over worked 12 hours shifts, unsafe equipment Osha would not approve. 10cents to a quarter raise. hardest part of the job was going into work. The best part of the job was leaving and never going back to that location. Company is good just not that area. I enjoyed my workmates but if the managers notice you work well together they break you up to balance the loads. let corporate know my concerns. will not go back."
bad,Job really sucks you have one manager telling you to do this and another telling you to do that everytime you talking to another employee about work they think your messing around terrible job.
bad,Did not provide employees chances to succeed in the company. no consistency with agents. the typical big company who think they're employees are replaceable
bad,"This job is a life sucking situation, not a one happy employee, including management. The 7,8,9,and 10 day straight day runs will surely make anyone unhappy in no time at all. Something must be done."
bad,"Working at Lowes is frustrating. It's hard to get any work done due to the store meetings that take place during the day in which nothing meaningful is ever said! There are too many rules to follow which makes getting anything done difficult. You are constantly waiting for someone to unlock a gate or baby sit you when running equipment. They don't allow you to carry a proper knife to open cases, you are forced to use the plastic case cutter they supply you which can't cut butter on a hot day. What a joke. The schedule is terrible with no consistency. I hate working at Lowes and hope to find a new job soon."
bad,"Management team only cares about making bonuses.  They don't know what they are doing.  Schedules 1 person to cover 3 or more departments. You will be working with a customer in one department and management is yelling at you to go to another department to help customers.  When you explain that you are working with a customer, they still yell at you.  Then they ask why your freight isn't up."
bad,Was hired as a cdl driver. Was forced to drive box truck and deliver appliances. Had to fill in at different departments when they were short handed.managers did not appreciate the extra work you put in.
bad,Too many teenie boppers coming in and stirring up drama. Unfair on advancement they would always choose who the liked not by who actually deserved the position
bad,Managers only talk to you to tell you what your doing wrong. understaffed  and no cross training. The floor staff refuse to help cash out or load customer purchases. Even taking a walk to get a drink of water or a bathroom break can get you the evil eye from you're manager.
bad,"I was a delivery driver for nearly two years, until they restructured the place, they hired all new managers to replace the old ones, for less pay and they haven't a clue as to how it works, and talk about laziness! I was lucky to work with a good group of delivery guys however, and made some good friends throughout the store, if it could be managed right I may still be there as the pay was fair for the area, my advice is think twice before you work there"
bad,"Management are fickle, whatever is trending corporate wide gets the attention for the time being. This changes all the time."
bad,"Lowes as a company had a great vision in the beginning, 15 years ago they truly showed that ""they cared for their employees"", however during my 10 years as employee...1 year as a Department Supervisor and 9 years as a Merchandising Manager, Night Crew Manager, and Administrative Manager, I saw many great employees get fired due to some small technicality or some personal vendettas by Poor  Store Managers. Their biggest opportunity has been finding the right Store Manager for the Job...and not the one that LOOKED right for the Job. Promotion to Store Manager from within the company was almost near done...however always preached"
bad,"could not get training promised and required due to disarray of management's lack of communication, computer problems  BUT held responsible for everything I was supposed to get in training.  Promised lots of hours only to get them reduced due to ""poor sales"".  Management does not have it together and they could care less about you if you are part time."
bad,"I love most of the people I work with and supervise. Majority of the employees look out for on another, but the ASM's and the Store Manager doesn't know what they are doing. As long as you are in the ""in-crowd"" everything is great. The ""management"" play favorites. The employees are absolutely amazing. I would enjoy my job more if the management would be more respectful of their employees."
bad,"I enjoy my time with Lowe's and I would not be pursuing other employment if I was full-time but since I am not I have to continue to pursue other options due to the fact that part-time employment is not meeting my financial needs."
bad,Dont work here. They are about to layoff mgrs. store almost closed. The upper mgrs yell and set goals that cannot be made. Most new people quit. No one helps each other.
bad,It seemed as if noone knew what to do at any given time so they just guessed. Thus leading to an uncontrolled environment with no respect for managers.
bad,"I was a Sale Specialist at Lowe's making them 20-30k a month while being paid 11 dollars an hour with commission incentives being taken away. "
bad,got me through college. bosses don't care. they just care about themselves. better than previous retail experiences tho. they pay more than average.
bad,"One of the worst places ever, ASMs at my location use threats of termination to intimidate associates and some are never seen on the floor, they hide in the office area and only come out to berate employees."
bad,"The Pittston location is horrible and very racist . Racial jokes , intimidation , racial slurs are very common . No respect among team members , Too many stupid and worried drivers too , for your own good and safety stay away from this DC location . Too many turn over , they easily get rid of team member for a little mistake , they keep bad team members for years . you can not win !!!"
bad,This place is mentally and physically exhausting. The management of this place is beyond selfish and inconsiderate. This company does not care about its employees in the least and is not loyal to its employees in any way. There is absolutely no way I would ever work at this place again. The co-workers are great they are the only thing that kept me sane. The typical work day involved management breathing down your neck every second of the day even if you always did your job right and satisfying customer at the expense of the employee. I have witnessed management call people back from their lunch breaks to come back to work. I had to ask 6 times for my yearly raise before I got it. The hardest part of the job was keeping a smile on your face after a day of your soul being sucked out of your body.
bad,"Management is terrible and incompetent at all levels. A typical work day makes you feel like your alone in the whole store due to insufficient staffing. The store manager who's supposed to be the leader, is unreliable and never any help. A complete burden and hindrance to the store. "
bad,Start times can vary from 5am to 2pm the same week. they can make you work up to 10 days in a row and than split the days you have off during that next week. ASM Management and support is very week.
bad,"I clean up the front end of Pro Service load customers, bring carts in from the parking lot .Some of them like to help . The hardest part of the Job is always being short handed. The most enjoyable part of the  day is going home."
bad,This is not a good management jobs. The demands are unreal and the pay does not match the responsible. Upper management and human resource are out for their self.
bad,"the management is horrible at the Statesville store, they have double standards and do not care about there employees. very un fair place to work"
bad,"this position is selling in the home windows, roofing, siding, gutters, fencing etc"
bad,"They hire a person on knowing they are hiring that person for a job they did not apply for or that they did not want. "
bad,"no support from management, they only take care of their own. absolutely no training in special fields, and pay is low"
bad,"Come to find out that it does not matter how hard you work or how friendly you are, I was hired as a Seasonal Employee, I worked all the days that they wanted me to work including day that I was off and they needed someone to come in. I come to find out by many people that were also seasonal that they got permanent part-time positions and went on to be in other departments. A good friend of mine that is a spouse of a military active duty member told me before going in to work for Lowes, she stated that they will not hire her because of her race, makes me wonder now if what she was stating was true. There were many that got hired with me and way after me and they were not told that their time was up."
bad,Management Would and will yell at you. The hardest part of the job was the responsibilities and they would pile them all on one person and they weren't organized at all. The co workers are great very friendly and makes you feel like a family. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the public. I love people and i gave them the customer service I would want.
bad,Simply put not worth your health have worked my self into the hospital do to the amount of heavy lifting on a daily basis hard to find help to lift and move items like concrete at 80 lbs a bag or 2x10x16 repetitive motions and co workers standing around talking most of the shift and management is included! Most CSA are expected to do everything including customer service to operating lifts and safety violation will get you fired quick! Stress only grows daily It is all about the numbers with the management at Potsdam and is not uncommon to have screw ups on a daily basis where you have to cator to the customer because of wrong orders or damanged goods.  Merchidice pick ups are often a nightmare with wait times longer than hour .  very few CSA can operate equipment and further more there is no pay increase to operators. PSE and psi are stolen from coworkers to get credit for the installs .  DM are seen many times Fixing numbers or disappearing all together And the pro loaders run the show !  Pro services treats you like you are there for them pulling their orders and yours several occasions I have pulled 12ft sheet rock with pro services and management not even offering to help ? Even had a family emergency and no one mentioned any program to help . if you like working as a mule apply if you don't please don't apply !
bad,"A good half to three quarters of the store barely does any work on a daily basis. They just sit around at their desks and get annoyed when you actually lead a customer over to them to get helped. If you do actually work, you'll quickly regret it. "
bad,be warned this store in Elmira is a bad place to work due to management and human resource manager they require you to violate dot regulations and have no respect for you your family or your license just to make them look good so they can bonus. they will follow you around to your stops and harass you and if you don't do what they tell you they will get rid of you be warned
bad,"Come on people. Don't waste one day of your life with this company. You will dedicate much time with little to no job security and the pay verses work/life balance is absolutely far far out of proportion. You can definitely find much better so run I say, run far far away!"
bad,"In working for Lowe's in South Scottsdale, I was very displeased with the whole corporation and how things were run. There is little to no customer service from employees. there is a lot of gossip and backstabbing and the management likes to play favorites with certain employees and manipulate and misuse company policy towards others."
bad,"Management although trying to look other wise, do not back up the associates.  Management has stated that Company Policy is a 'grey area', meaning it can be twisted to fit their agenda. The Management promotes and encourages a hostile work environment."
bad,This store was a very difficult store to work for because it was all about favortism. All management are friends and if they dont like you then you get picked on. They are fake smile in your face and talk behind your back
bad,I work there for almost 9 years. It was fun at first. All my coworkers were great. But when they changed the management after the first 9 months it was stressful I had to hold my words back in order to keep my job. I new as well as everyone else on the front end about our store manager having personal relations with one head cashier and found out that was the reason 6 of us were let go by him. Not a fair place to work for needless to say they both still work for lowe's
bad,"The harder a person works, the less respect they get. Only thing that matters to the management is the bottom dollar, they don't care about the staff. People always assume the worst about their co-workers. Only reason I stayed is because I need the paycheck."
bad,not a fun work place. non supportive management . all about the numbers. best part of the job was my coworkers. more of a chore than a job. overwhelmingly under staffed.
bad,"the worst job experience of my life. i was hired as an overnight stocking manager. the day i was supposed to start my position after they formally hired me for the position, the hr and store manager found out that there store was not slotted to have this position. they then forced me to take another management position in the store. they gave me the delivery managers position, they threw me into the position with no training, no help on their antique computer system and no one to help train or help me. when i told them i was overwhelmed with the position the hr manager asked me if i was officially resigning from lowes. i have never worked for someone that is so unorganized, i doubt that the management in place could successfully run a lemonade stand. i would suggest that you apply anywhere else that you can get a job instead of working for this company. also do not quit a job to work for them they will find anyway to screw you this is why they have constant job postings for this store. people will jump ship at the first chance they get. so much turnover."
bad,"The management is horrendous for this company. They do not have any accountability there what so ever. Their policies and procedures are also absurd and they also change policy on a regular basis. Management and HR also do not listen to anything that their employees have to say, or if they do listen it just simply does not matter.They also do not schedule enough staffing which raises customer complaints because they can not find anyone to help them with their needs. I would never work for this company again and I would not recommend this as a place of employment for anyone."
bad,"Great place at first, then management came in and said no more spifs or commissions.  Then they tell us it's for the customer. I moved 2.4 million out of one of their medium market stores in one year. I sold all appliances to a apartment complex and got told tough s#!t on the spifs. They bumped my hourly up to a fair amount but I was leaving 40 to 50 k on the table had i been working for a salary plus base style that is common in this industry. I hung in there two years then got an offer that I am very happy with since. Good place to use as spring board but they do not care about the people who really make them money. Upper level management making 100k and up I know first hand, plus 12 to 15 million to a race team. They have the money just not for you."
bad,"Try to give suggestions about your department you are labeled a crybaby. If you aren't in the management click then look out. Long work days and no appreciation. Its always do, do, do, and then you will do whatever they say."
bad,"What Lowe's tell you about the program is not what the program is really like.  You work long hours, no manager support, no lunches, or breaks, and no support from corp."
bad,"terrible company to not get the opportunity to work for. spent a year working like a dog and they changed my compensation 4 times. was making 14 an hr due to getting excellent production on the conveyor so they ""adjusted"" the percentages and sent me back to $9 an hr. one week i actually made 9.08 which means that they gave me an 8 cent production for that week EVEN THOUGH I UNLOADED A TRUCK A DAY FOR THE WHOLE WEEK!!! was eventually fired because i spoke out to hr about being passed over for hiring while 30 people off the street were hired straight on."
bad,The only good thing about this place is the ping pong table in the break room and some of the people you meet at the job. Management could care less about the people on the floor. They treat everyone as a number.
bad,"Retail is a special environment for people that love retail.  In a few words Lowes is a great company but you do have to have the retail blood in your genes or you will not be successful."
bad,No full time work available just do you job go home no overtime pay.
bad,Staff and Management have agenda and it was like going back to high school.  Management did not look at doing business as it should be done.
bad,"I needed a job so I worked here, wouldn't work there again, management was worthless"
bad,"Racist managment, no african american managers in store at all. Im white and i can even see this. These store managers lie to the employees on a daily basis. Drivers are treated like trash . Appliance salesmen have the green light to overload delivery drivers when ever they fill like it."
bad,"Management is awful. If one does well in a position, they will thwart any attemps to move into other positions. Completely void of any ethical behavior in the hiring/advancement process."
bad,"it's a job"
bad,The management didn't follow policy and it led to people being under trained and unprepared for the work they had to do. You won't be given the tools and resources you need. Injuries abound because of the excessive workload and lack of staff. They will regularly work you in eight to ten day stretches by load the back end and front ends of two work weeks. Some of the employees are really good people but it isn't worth the effort when you could be paid a similar amount for work that isn't dangerous or strenuous.
bad,Loading Customers and stocking inventory.  I learned that hard work at this company means nothing.  Management played favoritism too much.  Co workers all left the jobs because of unfair practices.  Helping make our lumber department be the best in Region and be rewarded with more work and no pay.  Only enjoyable part was having a job.
bad,"Preview"
bad,"This is a company that if your not part of the right clique, your going to lose your job no matter how hard you work. The location I worked at, the HR manager was a moron, if you asked any questions about benefits or anything, she'd just refer you to the website. I've talked to 3 other employee's whose benefits got messed up because she didn't know her own job. There's such a high turnover in every position, from a csa to store manager. Any attempt to change departments or advance in your career get blocked. The only benefit of this employer, is they pay pretty well all things considered. That's about it. Expect to work your butt off for no job security."
bad,"Too much drama. if you didn't suck up, you couldn't move up. front end was very unprofessional"
bad,This is absolutely the worst place I have ever worked. I am currently employed here which is why I am very actively seeking employment now. The hours drop dramatically between October and February. I have gotten as little as 8 hours per week. Management is out of touch with who their hard workers are and who is just here out of boredom. Some people need their job and others just want to occupy time. Management gives those in need 15 hours and less and those who do not need or want as many hours 30+!! They do not care about your well being and talking to them will only make your hours decrease even more!
bad,"I did delivery of appliances ,not one bit of appreciation, little support of management, just do what you are TOLD High expectations for short money no set schedule The most interesting thing is WHY are they ALWAYS looking for help??? I rarely see Home Depot looking for help. HMMMM ???"
bad,"The company sounds good on paper and online, but in practice, it does not care for its employees. Favoritism runs rampant, and unless you are on the ""good"" list, they try to get you fired."
bad,"The Temecula, CA location is the worst location to work for."
bad,"This is a horrible company.  The culture is highly political and relationship based.  Very high turnover rates in IT and Supply Chain.  "
bad,"A typical workday involves management playing favoritism, treating their favorites like gold, only these favorites are among the most lazy.  Ultimately, management has the power to treat you as unfair as they want.  There is no ""big brother"" looking out for the management team.  "
bad,"It is a good place for part time employees. Can set your hours, days. Full time, get used to not seeing your families. Your days off will be inconvenient, shortened by closing before your day off, and opening after your day off. Management has strange ideas about customer service. If applied with common sense, it would work."
bad,"This is a place for unprofessionals to work. It's all about being a favorite and they treat customers like they are nobody. Customer service is surely not a factor a Lowes.  They don't value the best employees, they go by likes and dislikes. If you are goal oriented and professional, this is not the place of choice. Only good for young ones as a first job surely not a for a career. They need to learn professionalism and leadership because their values is meaningless and pointless. They don't know how to talk to you there at all. It's a big thing for management to yell at employees and they take it. I won't.Very unprofessional place to work. I feel sorry for those that is there and continue to take being mistreated. I pray for better because you all deserve better."
bad,"The Lowes store 1201, had the worst managment. Although they had an ""open door"" policy and encouraged you to come speak with them about issues or concers you had, they would turn you away. Most employees in that store were under 30, so it was nothing but gossip and high school drama. I prefer a professinal atmosphere."
bad,"When I first started lowe's I loved it the managers cared about their employees and the well being of the store. Over the years though I have noticed that lowes has really taken a down fall. The way the management team is now ran is ridiculous. The company is very political and they do not hide it. I have personally seen many co workers become devastated because someone who was undeserving got the position that they wanted. Lowes use to not be so political, but I think with their way of change, Lowes is going in the wrong direction and will most likely not survive if they do not get back on policy. "
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and requested a maximum of 20 hours a week because I was a full time student. Not only did they ignore my availability by scheduling me for times and days that I had class despite me constantly correcting them, I was also scheduled 30-35 hours a week. "
bad,"Bullied, No Respect, management does not appreciate good associates, lack of concern or willing to help, lie lie lie"
bad,I do not enjoy working for this corporation. I do not feel that I apply myself by answering a phone for a living. I feel as if I am wasting my degree every moment I spend at my desk.
bad,"Seem to be trending to hire part time employee's vs. Long term experienced full time employee's. Management and floor workers did not work well together. All floor worker were good hard working individuals. Had a lot of knowledge of my area of work. they had nothing new for me to learn, other than Company proceedures. Very hard to get personal information from HR department. Would not recomment working at Lowe's for a career!"
bad,"Lowe's is enticing at first glance. It has competitive pay scales, benefits, and a seemingly laxed environment. however, there are many bureaucratically charged issues that will get you fired faster than you can blink."
bad,Lowe's is a good place to work while searching for other opportunities.
bad,"Lowes former store manager , admin manager, department manager and lost prevention , are mess up, unfair people. if you want to move up you have to sleep with the manager"
bad,Management are stupid and follow a written script from corporate. We can never keep an HR or someone that knows anything. A lot of favoritism. Customers steal like crazy and the company does nothing about it. Next time when you steal we will gladly walk you out with a smile and tell you to come back and steal again. ONE STUPID A** STORE!
bad,"typical day involved putting out the money, assigning registers, lunches and breaks. The most important thing that I learned at Lowe's was that management at the Lowe's I worked at could not be trusted. The co- workers were wonderful but the stress of working there made the employees dissatisfied and therefore on edge al the time. Hardest part of the job was to assure the employees that Lowe's did care about them and had their well being in mind. Was the day I left."
bad,"Life outside of Lowes did not exist. The only way to advance is if you were one of managements favorites. I felt like I was always looking over my shoulder and management was unwilling to listen to any ideas, nor did they show any appreciation when you went above and beyond."
bad,Bad company to work for.
bad,"Expect too much of associates for little compensation. I worked hard to show that I move up in the company, but there were no chance of promotions. I had no life, I practically lived for Lowe's. Lowe's does not want you to have a life, so you don't look for another job and you're stuck there doing what management tells you to do."
bad,"I started working for Lowe's at the age of 18. I was quickly promoted within the company, but I feel it had more to do with the fact I did not need as much training as the other employees who had applied for the promotions. The training in Lowe's stores is very limited. They go through an initial orientation and after that, all training is left up to the employee to do on their own. Unfortunately, there was a lot of conflict in the store when it came to employees respecting one another. I was never really involved in the issues, but I was aware of it all or told about it all. People lacked the ability to work as a ""team"" - and training people to work as a team never took place. Management seems to disappear frequently - to the point you can't find them anywhere... and in a lot of cases, they have left the store completely after clocking in. CSA's are left to do what zone managers should be responsible for. Seemed like if you asked for help, you were made to feel like you were stupid for asking questions. I kept to myself and just did my own work and if I had problems I figured them out on my own. I got to the point I knew the system like the back of my hand due to practice - not training. Compensation is tight - and benefits are not good. I would recommend a private insurance over Lowe's insurnace, especially for non-management employees. Overall - my time with Lowe's was less than satisfactory. I would not recommend working there - job security is a huge problem within the company now."
bad,Had very little team support and very difficult to support customers in the professional manner
bad,Nice people horrible culture and advancement opportunities
bad,"Company started out ok. I made good money but the hours were long and ur days off change. Company started taking little things away and before we knew it we had nothing, but were told at least u have a job."
bad,Managment is a joke. Hypocritical. Strung me along promising a promotion for 3 years and never recieved one even after contacting district hr about the situation. No one ever gave me a reason as to why i was not promoted or what I needed to improve on to get a promotion
bad,I worked for Lowe's for 9 years and was harassed my management on a normal basis for things that I did not even do.
bad,Lacks real direction and definition of priorities....concentrates on fluff stuff and shies away from issues of substance.  Has drifted away from genuine veteran appreciation to simple gestures of same...
bad,As part of the downsizing a few years ago I will never trust lowes again. I understand company changes but not the way they handled it. Management was very sneaky.
bad,I liked my job for the first few months I worked there but when the other full time customer service assistants quit I was left as the only one to help customers out and management refused to help out
bad,Their is no leardship and the customers are always rude to the cashiers and no sales associates help customers and they can‚Äôt keep anybody cause they cut hours and have to many people who are changing the schedule all the time and do not tell the employees that they have changed their schedule
bad,"I have worked in Lowe's for the past five years and have had the chance to grow within the company, travel, and have fun jobs. However the change on a corporate level creates friction in the physical stores. Over the past two years so many jobs and positions have been consolidated and with no advanced warning it makes you feel as if there is a day to day basis where the threat of you loosing your job is very prevalent."
bad,"People are nice,helpful and generally get along. Wages and benefits are good but having to work almost every weekend really is a downer. The upper management is very poor. They constantly, randomly change your schedule and don't tell you so you may show up to work to find out you were taken off the schedule.Certain dates are blacked out so you can't even request off. No family life."
bad,Lots of people steal and alot more complain. I got insurance working part time but the pay was under $10.00. I liked the hours of 6am to 11pm. We got to leave as soon as the store closed.
bad,To many employees crying about that they have to actually do physical movement and work. Most of them literally earn a paycheck for doing the bare minimum. Brown nosing is famous at my location. If you brown nose the so called in crowd of managment you will get by earning your check by literally doing nothing.
bad,Difficult place to have worked and would not recommend it to family or friends. This American company came and went like others before it. Out of the gate in a big display of bravo and quit on a city and its people before giving them a deserved chance to succeed.No further comment.
bad,"good place to work.  other employees pretty lazy and don't want to do their job which creates more work for others.  Drove a forklift in the United States Navy for 5 years, then was hired on with no experience while 90% of the job is driving a forklift."
bad,"Very negative leadership and negative energy throughout store.  Management intentionally left departments with no capable associate to assist customers. "
bad,Very stressful situations.  Was an ASM with this company was expected to work 50 plus hours a week.  Corporate has no idea what direction they want to take the company.  Often roll out programs that are not well though out and do not work.
bad,"I had obtained a customer focused pin within 3 months and yet was denied advancement by a manager i had complained about, instead the position was given to an associate who was extremely inert and received many complaints by co-workers"
bad,"Got a position in a brand new role to the company. Then a few months after I was hired, they changed the name/acronym of the job then fired me from that job and gave it a new pay grade with a raise of around 6 bucks and offered it to a tenured associate. Now I just work on the floor and there is nowhere to go from there. I know the pay ceiling for my pay grade and its not a livable wage. You don't feel appreciated in this company and you're just a number to them."
bad,The uninspired  are led by the uninspiring.management has nothing but kiss butts that  toe the party line.14 years 5 as a asm was more than enough thank you
bad,"Zippity bip bop boop no job security and they won‚Äôt let you know if they change your supposedly fixed schedule. Good for getting forklift certified etc., but after that look elsewhere."
bad,"Working for Lowe's was a good experience, personnel morale is low and communication was not the best between management and employees. Communication between employees and customers was awesome."
bad,"I would give 110% every time I walked in the door each morning"
bad,"I was part of the 1500 managers that were eliminated. At my location the three oldest managers were the ones left go. Since then the company has left go many other positions including hr staff, facility maintenance staff, and assembly teams just to name a few."
bad,Not sure if our jobs will last for more than a month or two due to poor management the new CEO is ripping a well run machine to shreds . Since he started noboy is happy and they don't seem to care. The new in sore management has nasty attitudes
bad,"Worked for Lowe's over a decade. The first few years were great. You felt like everyone cared from store management to corporate managers. Then corporate kept changing things, making it more miserable year after year to work for. Customers suffered while we were expected to get things they wanted done or we were wrote up. Managers were told not to help us any more. Just tell us what to do while they just stood around supervising."
bad,"10 hour work day,they try to teach you every thing  with in the plant to fast.I did not have time to pick up on things because they wanted you to learn every thing to fast,Not enough time to learn what you needed to.Very poor management,they do not care about any one in the work place,I was told I could be replaced any time.Work place culture they wanted 100% from the work force,Too many people getting fired for not making there goal of 100%.They gave all the heavy freight to the older works and all the light freight to the younger folks.I had No enjoyable part of my job at Lowes."
bad,"Do mot waste your time here, new CEO, new methods, that do not look like things for the better. "
bad,"I would not recommend this employer to anyone. There is no job security, especially with more rounds of layoffs coming, and little room for advancement. The management is lacking in experience and professionalism. I saw so many good people lose their jobs to layoffs and b.s. firings. They do pay higher to start then other retailers but you will find there are pay caps for all hourly positions. The management consists of many people that have failed at other stores."
bad,You will find out why people quit and why Lowe‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a good place to work. The coaches and PI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt on the same page. My training didn‚Äôt go well. I‚Äôll be looking for employment elsewhere.
bad,You need to make sure there is enough coverage on the floor in each department so that people are not overworked and your customers are taking care of
bad,You are treated like a slave.  They started 10 hour workdays and we don't get two days off in a row anymore so your one day off you spend playing catch up with your home and then back to work.  There is no schedule so you can't plan your life or have any family time.  Don't apply at Lowe's!!!!
bad,"Shifts varied. Head cashier's were "
bad,Lowes does not have a skilled management team and it shows. Never seen a company with such high turn over. If leadership knew how to lead and manage it would be a great place to work.
bad,"The pay is fair for the job, but your role is ever changing, changes are only vaguely explained, and training is very minimal. Workers are dissatisfied with unclear expectations and favoritism. Workers are promoted or demoted based on their close friendships with management opposed to skill and work ethic. Work/life balance does not exist. You either work full time hours without many (or any) full time benefits or you barely work at all."
bad,"Definitely a company that is struggling to figure out a direction. The company pretends it wants to supports a home life but management continues to schedule however they want despite new policies. If you want to make work your number one priority, then definitely the place for you."
bad,"Lowe's was in my opinion, a good company. I advanced from seasonal to ASM in 5 years. When they started their ""structure change"" they stopped caring about their employees. How little they could pay their employees was their only concern. On another note, following / copying every thing Home Depot did / does, is a mistake. If you always follow, you will never lead. Just my .02."
bad,"Companies;s CEO is making changes, without changing the training structure or old software. Always under staff, so who shows up at work is overloaded by work and on top, upper management doesn't want give over time. When you need them to help with customer, they just leave."
bad,"My store could potentially be an awesome place to work, we just have some management issues.  I feel like the moral at my specific store is way down and nobody wants to be there anymore... we are overworked and unappreciated."
bad,Customers will never find the help they need with us running 2-3 depts every day. Management trys to go in different directions instead of staying on the same page.
bad,"Working at Lowe‚Äôs, the schedule is different everyday. You cannot have a life outside of Lowe‚Äôs because the time you work flip flops everyday. If you have actives you like to do outside of work you will not be able to do anything except work because of the time of day flip flopping schedule. Example: If you have something you like to do that meets Monday nights, you will not be able to do that anymore working at Lowe‚Äôs."
bad,The only thing I like about the job is that I work 5 days a week weekends off depending on the role and position. Otherwise its more for retired people or students.
bad,Its a Great place If you have the right management and staff. I'm still with the company but Looking other places because the store isn't ran correctly. Love the company and the work we do.
bad,Everything is blamed on night shift and we are constantly cleaning up behind the day shift before we can even begin our own work. So if you don't mind working for a company that doesn't have  your back and threatens to terminate you for what another shift does. Go for it!
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs has changed so much in a short period of time, even the customers think it‚Äôs a joke.  The company is pretty much morphing into The Home Depot.  Why would you want to work for a company that lacks innovation?"
bad,"Dont work here. Your vacation will be fixed around the managers schedule not your own."
bad,"Too much favouritismin in most departments, they do job fairs but they already have the positions filled with friends or family members. Maybe review managers more often"
bad,"The people that you work with are fantastic. A friendly group of people that you can really get to know. The people you work for are a completely different story. Whether it be a lunatic who is a slave driver, or when you are outed to your department manager after being told that a complaint would be fully confidential. They treat you like a number and you are paid barely anything. Not worth the headache."
bad,"Just refer to my star ratings. Do yourself a favor, and seek out something better. This is a humble warning. If not, you'll be remembering my review while you're miserable."
bad,Management is terrible. They break open door policies and then punish you. I worked here for 3 years and I make 14 cents above minimum wage. You work can work your butt off but still get treated like you're useless . And God forbid you call in sick.
bad,"Joined Lowe‚Äôs in 16‚Äô, it was a pretty awesome place to work!  "
bad,"Head cashiers made working here drama central. If they dont like someone, then they single them out and make sure they know they arent liked. They push surveys and credit applications to a point that makes customers angry and uncomfortable.  The new rule about asking military discount members for an ID only a couple years after claiming the Mylowes account would make them never have to show ID again made the customers so angry I even got a death threat over it. They did a competition about who could get the most surveys and when I won with a large number of surveys they claimed that I cheated and took the surveys myself. Whoever was in charge of scheduling was a joke. We were always short staffed. I almost always ended up being the only cashier during the busiest times which would have 15 or more people in line all yelling at me. Management would stand over by customer service and watch. Managment would also shove me out of the way to change the prices of things and then give themselves a discount whenever I would ring them out. My location is rumored to be the worst in the region. I know people at other locations that didn't have such a rough time!"
bad,The Griffin store is an awful store to work at..Very poor management..The last manager quit really fast he seen real fast this store was not being run right at all..
bad,Lowes is like a ping pong table  but my store manager was kewl. Merchandising managers areas was weak. Too many people leaving not a good culture. Horrible work environment
bad,"Management is horrible about letting people go for coming in late repeadily and calling out or not calling at all for 3-4 days in a row. The atmosphere is bad within Lowe's, I hate going to work. Management has basicily said to everyone without saying a word that its ok to come in late without calling and its ok to NOT call at all for days. You can still come back."
bad,Boring and dull place to work. Managers do not care about you. Work there felt like a chore and I was not happy to go into work at all. The company only cares about profits and not their employees.
bad,"i learned never work at lowes again!!!"
bad,"So much favoritisms!  One girl lies and they believe her!  She flirts with Asst mgrs!   Toning happens!  She get pregnant with a service manager and all of that is okay!  Sad!  Lowes!  Allows this behavior and firers a hard worker!  "
bad,"Unfortunately I am not comfortable reviewing Lowe's as a Company at this time. Although for almost 11 years they provided for me and my family, there were always uncertainties with in the HR role, and they did not try to ease any minds. Until they told us they were eliminating our role, 60 days prior to our last day."
bad,Not a good place to work now that the new CEO has taken over. Not focusing on employees needs and do not recognize anything but the bottom dollar!  Look elsewhere!
bad,"So let's start with the assistant store management, since there are no longer actual department managers. (???)  40-ish year old men who basically have only been good at retail their entire lives...every morning there is a ""mandatory"" (as of two weeks ago) meeting about sales numbers and it's one of the most depressing things. Let's all get super excited about 24 boxes of so and so on a pallet that we can't find...first one to find it gets...nothing. "
bad,Definitely the worst place I've ever worked treat their employees terrible manager act like they're better than you don't get regular days off split days off just terrible terrible terrible
bad,"They expect you to give your whole life to the work place. If everything isn't 100% perfect you get written up for it, or just walked out. It forces all the employees to only focus on the negative, makes for a very difficult work environment"
bad,The store I worked for has terrible management and the overturn of employees is mind blowingly fast. Customer comes first? Yea right. They dont even care about the staff.
bad,"Management can‚Äôt decide on how they want to run the store.One manager tells you to do things this way. 6 months later another manager tells you to do things another way.Then 6 months after that a 3rd manager wants you to tear it down,rebuild it and do the same thing a different way. This never stops. Lowe‚Äôs is a revolving door for employees and managers. How you get treated depends on if you are in their little click"
bad,"At one time Lowe's was a good company, but now it's ran by numbers people on the East coast. The sooner they can cut staffing the better their bottom line looks. Management sits in the office instead of walking the floor so employees use their time as an extension of social hour. No accountability and full time jobs are being replaced with part time. Lowe's is spending billions to buy back their stock instead of investing in new technology and proper training from management to floor associates. Makes the stock holders happy while they quietly eliminate more and more jobs. Teamwork is a lost to finger pointing and the all familiar mantra of ""I'm the only one that does anything around here"". Constant short staffing and attendance problems have burnt out the few that stay."
bad,Very stressful place. Associates talk about each other like dogs. Mamagement don't care about your concerns. They just brush them off. Barely get hours
bad,New CEO has eliminated thousands of jobs in the past year. You could walk in for a normal work day and half way through your shift be walked out because your position has been switched to a third party company or eliminated completely.
bad,"Management is a joke. "
bad,"Very unsafe workplace.  Last in region on safety.  Too many mgrs not enough employees.  ( last morning meeting had 5 employees and 10 mgrs). None of the mgrs would help customers or employees.  They all tend to disappear in the afternoons.  The store manager was non existent and when he is there,  he would stand at the exit door next to his photo that said store manager.                                    "
bad,I work at a lowes for 10 and a half years and it even though it was a good place to work it is getting worse because they don't want to hire nobody and make people do multiple jobs and it is very stressful I didn't that it really bother me a whole lot work my hours and go home
bad,"The managers treat you like trash, they cut hours down to nothing, sometimes 4 hours a week. Employees are encouraged to screw over their coworkers and management will not back you up in any circumstances."
bad,"I can't speak for all Lowe's locations, but this one is the worst. I started as part time in lumber until they decided to just drop me in paint with no formal training. Management changed around so much in the two years I worked there that they can't even tell you who is in charge. For whatever reason, the seasonal employees make way more than sales associates, with some of the cashiers starting at $12-$14. The new store manager is a toad and picks who he wants for positions instead of doing interviews. Stocking crew do their jobs half-assed and completely destroy your shelves. Scheduling is horrible as well, with the closer coming in as the opener leaves, with no mid for lunch coverage; not that they even guarantee your breaks. Most of the employees know nothing outside of their departments, and if they do, they're oftentimes forced into covering those departments as well. All in all, I wouldn't suggest this location to even my worst enemy."
bad,"an a manager be ready to work anytime any day.  Lowes is a 24/7 business.  Very hard physical work.  No life and work balance.  In my district I experienced a culture lead by the DM of management by intimidation and bullying .  The district is obsessed with taking pictures by phone and sending to you as your ""to do list"". Rather than talking to you to let you know what is needed to be done.  District team members visit the stores and take pictures and send to the DM without telling the SM.  So you get nasty text messages at any time along with pictures.  I found this practice very disconnected from personal coaching.  I would not recommend working for Lowes in the Miami district ."
bad,Not really a good job at all. And the management team is really poor. No real support system. And no real pay honestly. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest making this job a career
bad,"For the first couple of months there was nothing wrong with the job, they worked with your hours and scheduling. After that it‚Äôs downhill. Horrible scheduling even as a part time employee. I was working almost 40 hours a week as part time while also trying to do college work. Even when i requested days off they would not allow it due to scheduling because management is horrible."
bad,"I worked for this company for 7 years, the new manager did not like me personally. She falsely fired me, which unemployment investigated. I reported her several times and know of other employees that also reported her and nothing ever happened to her."
bad,"The opportunity started out great; however, when promoted, there was little to no training for the new position. Management is not professional and did little to support managers in their new roles."
bad,Horrible management bad work atmosphere!!!!!  Nobody does there job and gets away with it. They hire people that have no prior experience in the department they are put into.
bad,"Store management is constantly pushed to squeeze more out of hourly associates.  Systems are being upgraded, but it is still an outdated hodge-podge of systems that people must navigate through.  District leadership is downright abusive and nasty and managers are often driven to being the same to get results from hourly teams.  District management will seldom praise the good and berate managers in front of hourly associates. No one is ever allowed to defend anything that might be less than perfect no matter what the circumstances are.  For the last few years, I‚Äôve watched the most talented and knowledgeable sales associates disappear because of the leadership culture.  Leaders are not given great quality of life and deal with text messages and phone calls when they aren‚Äôt even scheduled and in violation of labor laws.  Hard work done to merchandise the store is frequently rewarded with sudden changes to all the work you‚Äôve done on the whim of district and regional leadership.  You are constantly accomplishing the same work or task over and over because direction is slow or misguided. Store managers will often be slow to make decisions because they are frequently second-guessed at higher levels."
bad,"store mgr inexperienced & doesn't know what he's doing. employee moral is miserable because mgmt. doesn't care about employee. lazy employee gets away with murder. structure needed. "
bad,No accountability. Workplace discrimination takes place frequently. No help for customers or employees. Skeleton staff year around. People only last a few weeks and they are gone.
bad,"Not a team building store manager."
bad,Never enough employees to get work done. CA not provide enough customer service due to lack of floor associates. Rotating work shifts hurt the home life.
bad,"The management team did not hold employees accountable including themselves.Training was not a priority.They just wanted you to 'figure it out""on your own.When it comes to accountability there was a serious problem.Employees having sexual relations in the electrical room.Employees smoking in the outside garden area and back of lumber area.Vaping in the breakroom.Managers included.Employees & managers hiding clearance/markdown items from customers so that they could purchase the items for themselves.Most employees seemed to be much more focused on the product rather than the customer coming in the store to purchase them.Extremely poor management style/team overall.I was pleased with the pay and I did enjoy helping the customers."
bad,Super poor communication. I worked non CDL they had me carrying fridges up 30 flights of stairs with no regard for labor force orfood 30 F-ing fridges
bad,"Your co workers are what get you through the day. poor management. No way to go up, you either go right back down or out the door! It‚Äôs an awful place to work! The pay is horrible for what you have to do compared to fast food. Management NEVER listens!"
bad,The typical day is coming into a short staffed store. Management team were not on the same team and they were not nice to the ones that do their jobs and more. They were not very encouraging to the staff or help when they knew they were stretched to the max.
bad,For me it was not uncommon to have a closing shift leaving work at 11 pm and having to return the next morning at 6 am. As far a management goes you are a number. And if your day off happens to be on a holiday and the manager does not want to work the holiday; you are working that day.
bad,"I‚Äôve worked for lowes company for over a year now, at 2 different stores. I‚Äôm a cashier, previously HC. During this time at Lowe‚Äôs, I‚Äôve been treated very poorly by management and employees. Hours are long, but manageble, however, management makes no accommodations for scheduling. I came on as FT with open availability, however when I asked to step down to PT due to a lack of transportation I was told to simply quit and not waste any more of the company‚Äôs time. Ridiculous."
bad,"Insulted, hours cut, written up, said not working hard and yet I blew my back out twice and worked through an on going fire alarm. Everything falls under you even the managers job."
bad,Go to college make something of your self. Lowe‚Äôs is a slave labor job work u for little pay. All they care about is selling. No breaks unless u lucky. Always lifting heavy stuff
bad,"They have some real cut rate training. They have performance based bonus pay. Its not much. I performed over 150% constantly. That just made it so i could be used like a toby and was required to work more and harder than the average person. They used me up and i eventually felt ill just thinking about being there. The 10 hour shifts came with one smoke break of thirty minutes. Then they made us work 12 hour shifts. As if night shift was not a hindrance on having a life, i got to spend 14 hours a day on work. It burnt me out. Then they acted like i was not trying hard enough. I had a shift where i did 294%. When i wanted to apply for a.different shift and advancement they blocked it saying i was too valuable where i was at. Bye!"
bad,"Very low pay, they will change up your schedule without you knowing do always check your schedule. Lack of employees in the departments. Be prepared to cover or help multiple departments. They do not disclose or inform you of helpful programs within the company. Managers and Hr department rarely communicate to each other. Be aware you may have to tell more than one manger if your sick or want a vacation. Above all they will over work you for as little pay as possible."
bad,Your hours are different every day. Work night and weekends. Till 10 pm. Cut hours to save Lowe‚Äôs money. Can work as little as 16 hours per week. Never get overtime.
bad,"This is a very fast paced, heavy lifting, physical job. They say you lift up to 70 pounds but you end up lifting things way heavier, constantly, for a 10 and a half hour shift. Very under staffed so you are over worked. mandatory o.t. you will be working 50 hour weeks for a majority of the year. they no longer include a performance monthly bonus, but they expect you to still meet performance. Poor management. they hire management from the outside, which only hurts the workplace because they have no clue whats going on around them or how to help their team members. They are very strict with your breaks and bathroom breaks. You have to be on the MINUTE or you will be written up. They also have undertrained people training other people on equipment, which is a safety concern. Ive been with lowes more than a few years and they are really taking a huge tank. Work use to be enjoyable, and staff was nice to be around, and great incentives which no longer exist. Its changed drastically."
bad,Poor management keep telling you they are working on trying to make it better but just just empty promises.  I‚Äôm a flat bed delivery driver store is supposed to have loads pulled and ready but never do so you have to pull loads then deliver them yourself Management has no respect for your time or the fact that you have a family and kids that you want to spend time with sat the end of the day the managers are all about themselves and trying to work you into the ground so they can get big bonuses if you want to work at Lowe‚Äôs don‚Äôt work in the deliver department
bad,Company takes advantage of salaried individuals with poor work life balance.   CEO who has now departed had no vision and continually changed corporate path after poor investment choices.
bad,would not recommend to anyone with a family.  no home work balance. no training programs.  no team work. bias upper management . unfair work practices.
bad,"There are many payroll issues, with vacations being paid out in large sums due to an unknown policy, employees are stressed because payroll is rather thin, and the HR department is being streamlined so that employees have fewer resources available to them."
bad,Employees worked hard to help customers. Management  doesn't care about employees. Lost several employees in one month to the point of losing get almost 30.
bad,over worked under paid. management doesnt care about you or your life. customers come first. you dont get to go home till your deliveries are done and then theyll send you back out with more deliveries for complaining customers.
bad,"Horrible working environment. Our store manager is the most hateful person I have ever met. She has driven away most of our long term associates. The ones with the most knowledge in the store. As a result our customer service and morale have plummeted. We  have lost much business. The hardest part of the day is getting there and realizing our trucks are not loaded as promised some to all product not even pulled"
bad,"Loved working at Lowes but the pay is very low, do not give you very many hours or days of work so no over time. The 5th hour is not explained very will. New employee are treated some what nicely but with full time employee they tend to not be as friendly."
bad,"I currently work here at Lowe‚Äôs, and I work very hard to get my job done. When something goes wrong they blame me only when things are going slow. We have had a lot of employees quit or get fired , and the boss yells a lot."
bad,"Management was horrible,  they didn't want to do any work and would expect us to go above and beyond . We are under paid and over worked, short staffed and unappreciated.  They wanted the night crew to do other people's job, but if we needed help because we didn't finish freight the night before no one would do it, it would sit until we came in the next night. People would leave and they would not be replaced,  putting more work on us. The yearly raises where terrible almost nonexistent, compared to the work you put out. No communication,  you would find things out by other coworkers or last minute."
bad,Management is a joke. They live to bark orders but can never seem to figure out the solution or willing to help find one. Work till your tired and then  work some more but make them look good.
bad,I worked there for almost two years. Love the people I worked with. We still stay in touch. The work was hard at times but that's just delivery for you. Being on the road away from the store was ideal for me. No one breathing down your back. 
bad,"When Lowe's hired a new CEO from outside the company, the entire management structure changed twice in two years.  Jobs were eliminated and their duties were added to other jobs without compensation.  New managers were brought in from outside and we were evaluated by persons that did not know or understand our jobs.  They made empty offers of assistance. Many people were let go with no regard for the consequences to the operations of the store.  They are technologically backwards and any attempts to upgrade were disastrous.  It became apparent that decisions were poorly made; almost on the principle: If it ain't broke, break it.  My work experience their went from challenging to stressful to depressing to soul crushing.  Many of my colleges agree."
bad,"Managers, sales specialists and ‚Äúsenior service associates‚Äù are all lazy and expect the guys that are low on the pole to do all the work. The managers could care less what you think and they don‚Äôt want to help if your struggling with anything.  The sales specialist think you are their slaves and the ‚Äúsenior service associates‚Äù thinks since they are high on the pole they don‚Äôt have to do anything but sit back and play on the computer. They don‚Äôt want to help customers unless they have too. The pay is horrible and if you plan on moving up and you don‚Äôt kiss the managers butt then you might as well find a new job. If you plan on haveing a social life outside of work forget about it. You‚Äôll work weekend, Holliday‚Äôs, mornings, evenings. It‚Äôs retail so you‚Äôll expect that but normally you make a decent amount to compensate for that. Not at Lowe‚Äôs."
bad,Management is the absolute worst I have ever seen! Favoritism at this place is worse than high school! Too many incompetent managers who do nothing but be rude and belittling! The absolute WORST job I have ever had!
bad,If you want to advance in this company then you need to become a brown noser. That is how you get anywhere in this outfit. The management sucks. They make promises that they can‚Äôt keep. Management tells you to do something and you do exactly what they say you are still getting pulled into the office and talked to about it. They don‚Äôt appreciate the help they have.  They don‚Äôt pay  very good. They give you all these responsibilities for low wages. They expect you to cover multiple departments. Support managers through the smaller people under the bus. If you put in time for vacation for your honeymoon a year in advance they will just kick it out. Management are nothing but liars. Don‚Äôt waste your time working and putting anything into this store in . They suck the management does.
bad,This company is going in a direction that is not ethical and they are not a fair place to work. They set you up for failure and if you are not a brown noser you are pushed out .
bad,They always hire these Service MGR to think that they are helping the company but in all reality they always voiceing they opinions but not listening to the options that the employee has to offer or to the Customer on what they actually need
bad,No one really train you on how to do your job no one's willing to show you anything because they're all too busy to get you trained measurement complaints because you're not working hard enough you have to be really strong to do this job because no one's there to help you do it you have to use a pallet jack if you want get anything done with your job you only work 39 hours every week because they don't want to pay overtime you still get full benefits
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's looks like; Screaming customers, terrible management and a lack of communication between employees. A very stressful environment indeed."
bad,"Listen to your employees. More employees needed, trying to function on a skeleton crew. Customers and employees both suffer. Customers would complain about nobody around to help, and being ignored."
bad,"Lowes hires people that are unreliable, no experience related to essential job functionality, managers and supervisors are rude and inappropriate as well. My direct supervisor thought it was funny to make fun of his team members in front of everyone, when taken to hr about said issues, nothing was done, hr told me ‚Äú if you want, all of us can have a meeting and you can address your issues with him in front of me‚Äù you Would have better luck wining the lottery than getting promoted. Completely unprofessional."
bad,"LP use to be a great job, we lost our teeth, when our corporate leaders left. In my market, they have a absentee LPSOM, who's major concern is sucking up to those above him. They are all talk and no action. The store mgmnt team could care less about shrink, until the week before inventory and there is no LPOSM help, to convince them and oh did I mention the cut throat culture, I wa terminated, because of retaliation which is alledgedly against company policy and there is nothing i can do, because of texas law. Work somewhere else, Lowes will drive you crazy"
bad,"I worked here for 3 years. Management doesn‚Äôt care about you, only their paychecks. They don‚Äôt take workplace abuse seriously. Favoritism is inevitable."
bad,Wouldn't recommend working for Lowe's to any of my friends the managers play favorites.i ts always someone else word against yours.They treat people unfair.
bad,"The Lowe‚Äôs that I‚Äôve worked at was beyond under staffed. The management was very poor! Managers never answered calls when called for customer issues, and would always try to dodge associates when needed assistance. Managers never wanted to do their jobs , and even often had attitudes when asked for help! Employees often did what they wanted to do , such as taking 20 minute breaks instead of their 15 minute breaks. Newburgh Ny store has got to be the worst place I‚Äôve ever worked at, hands down!"
bad,"Outside of management, there is a considerable lack of enthusiasm and morale.  Bi-annual ""all-store meetings"" are held in an attempt to bolster morale, but employees are very much aware of the facade.  Staffing is constantly cut as is hours which makes it difficult to take care of customers - who takes care of customers when there's no one available to do so?  There is training available, but the majority of it does not really apply to the actual task at hand - the bare basics are provided, but you have to teach yourself (or learn from another more-experienced associate) how to actually do the job and use the required programs."
bad,management will try to disregard injured employees. the manager with ignore the doctor prescribed restrictions. what made it worth working at lowes was the employees not the management
bad,"Started out as somewhere great to be, had a flexible work schedule and good benefits, then went full time and got an opportunity to advance. Was cross-trained and kept to a set schedule, then when I tried multiple times to advance within the company again, I was told many times that it was either A) Not allowed for my position or B) I didn't make the cut, and it was handed over to others who were less qualified."
bad,Lots of cutthraots always have to be looking over ur shoulder seems like the management is only out to secure there own job and not the job of the employees
bad,This is a hard place to work unless you know someone in a managers position.  You never know for sure when you will get a day off even if you ask for one in advance.
bad,i work moday thru friday 40+ hours doing and picking up everyones hard work like down stocking helping customers and having to stay 1 to 3 hours after my shift is over to finish the work its no team its a job about doing the least and getting paid nd having others do your work.
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for many years.  It wasn't all bad, but lately it became unbearable, especially in delivery.  They tell you to keep your hours down, but load MY truck to the hilt, while other drivers had less items and promise next day delivery.  Management does not know what they are doing. Also, recently found out I was the lowest paid delivery driver there!!  Drivers who were hired recently were paid at least $1.00 more an hour, after I had been there for over 11 years."
bad,Lowe's changed its dynamics and did not give time to train in order to make successful. Treated management as less than hourly . Held no respect or standards.
bad,"For the position I was in, Lowes offered very little training.  I had to train myself.  Management was non-existent.  Not a good company  to work for."
bad,Aside from the nite manager the rest of the management team seemed to not care how the product went onto the shelves as long as it was there. Their lack of care for the employees left much to be desired.
bad,I will say that my experience at Lowes has not been the best I feel like they‚Äôre going away from what made them a great company to making them  just like everyone else.  They don‚Äôt have a really good worklife balance and is hard to plan something around the holidays.
bad,"The management staff at Lowes are lazy, rude and unreliable. They are not flexible even when they tell you that they are in an interview. They do not understand when you need vacation time and they do not like to negotiate. Lowes in Matthews, NC is unorganized and they do not know how to run a store. Very Poor Management"
bad,"Extremely understaffed stores. Employees lack knowledge of products due to poor quality training.  Lack of motivation and work ethic of employees due to management's poor treatment of employees. Scheduling is based on a computer program that is over ridden at the store level to give the ""in"" crowd good schedules while the rest suffer. Health benefits barely meet AHCA (Obamacare) minimum requirements.  Pay is as low as they can get away with and still keep people working for them. Do not expect management to honor any agreement that they made when you were hired."
bad,Everything was great besides the work rotation. Real tight knit group of people you loved working with and could depend on. They're trying to be too much like other retail stores. It's made them awful to work for now.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being understaffed and stressed.  One of the main problems was staffing.  Either call ins or just not employees to cover all of the departments for all of the shifts. Too often we were pulled from our departments to cover other departments but would still be responsible for the upkeep of our own departments.  Communication was also poor in the store I worked at. One manager would give employees tasks and another one would come an hour or two later and tell them to do something entirely different. Those employees never finished either sets of tasks so we would have a lot of things half done.  They didn't make sure that everyone was participating in customer service, cleaning the store and parking lot area.  Leadership was constantly changing and it showed."
bad,"Employee morale is low and management is non-responsive to this."
bad,"They should just do a complete overhaul of the management at this location. Every single manager that I had the displeasure of interacting with on a daily basis was rude to me, rude to the customers, and honestly did not care about their jobs at all. This management group was causing high turnover at that location and it was really not worth dealing with their attitudes and the high stress of working in a retail environment. The hours were a bit ridiculous as well. They would routinely schedule people to be working from 12pm-9pm thus cutting out a large chunk of the day and really interfering with a work/life balance. There was no balance. Only working."
bad,The job was simple go out and sell products that Lowes provides. The overall work week 40 depends on summer then a little longer. Ever since I heard about management changes everything became cut throat. Everyone is out from themselves and not the employees. The managers were even funny acting. There are a lot of fake people in the management positions. The sad thing is you have a a lot of good workers in that store that care about each other but now feel like the can't trust anyone anymore just sad.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Lowe's in South Carolina. No leadership from a managerial aspect. No advancement, no proper training. STAY AWAY"
bad,"Lowe's just reported that they are having a hard time getting the customer to actually buy things. As a company you got rid of 1000s of ASMs and Department Managers. What did you think was going to happen when you eliminated experience and knowledge. Worst store manager I have ever had in over 30 years of retail experience. The person at Lowe's is not important, at least at my store. All that matters is the store manager getting credit for everything and being a cretin."
bad,working with customers and customer service is a must.  Job is very easy to do and on the job training is provided.  If you don't like the general public this in not the job for you.
bad,No accountability of employees. Lack of leadership from majority of management. General overall atmosphere of store is negative with opportunities for advancement being very limited.
bad,I was expecting to be on my feet my entire shift excpet for breaks which usually got interrupted to help on the floor. Not all of the associates pulled their weight. Which left a lot of stocking and moving of ineventory to me because the Manager didn't intervene. I would reccomend it as a part time position or to a student.
bad,"poorly managed, No one wants to help anybody.  was fast paced for the unload crew.  They had us working full time hours, when job was part-time........"
bad,During my time with lowes I worked outside lawn and garden. This was during the busy season. I loaded  at least 50 bags of mulch and stones a day by myself without any help.
bad,"Lowes will have you working 3 departments and want you to cover a cash register. Then they will get mad at you because your department wasn't cleaned. If you like that type of work environment, then this is the job for you"
bad,"We went thru five store managers in less than ten years and as many if not more human resources managers.They eventually  just got rid of the human resources position all together. Maybe it should have been the store manager position. "
bad,"The management is very poor. The wages are decent, however, in order to get paid for what you actually know you must be a favorite. The benefits are not bad, I enjoy that."
bad,Great place to get retail experience and to help customers with all their needs. Working with others make the job fun. Lots of information to learn and lots of ways to grow
bad,"#Metoo workplace with no corporate protection. Often reminded I was taking a job from a man, my body was often commented upon in crude terms, the store manager said "" with how old you are why would you worry about being overweight"". A busy place with no real way to really do a satisfactory job. Turn over high. Out of date computer (DOS), equipment failure, customer theft high, air filtration system inadequate. Company is re-branding into an Amazon model, have built their delivery warehouses already and downsizing staff positions to adjust to that model. Unstable right now. Will be understaffed always. Stressful and hard to do a really good job even if you care."
bad,"I don't even know how to put it into words..."
bad,"The HR department is the worst I've ever seen, its like they haven't got a clue on how to do their job.  If you want to be treated like a dog, this is the place for you."
bad,lowes does a wonderful job of promoting the wrong people and only promoting people who interview well .It is a good place to work if you do not want to make anything of your life no careers to be found here
bad,Horrible management techniques. If your not one of the favorites you have no opportunity for advancement.  Corporate office does not care about local management issues.
bad,"not what it used to be - more interested in  impressing investors than employees or customers"
bad,The management is very poor.  I would've stayed and made a career but couldn't get over the management screwing things up for customers. I would not advise anyone to get a job there unless you want to deal with stupidity constant.
bad,"I was fire right after I was injured on the job.... "
bad,"would never want to work there again."
bad,"The store is always understaffed, the management structure is built to pass the blame down the chain and allow for the management to get away with doing minimal to no work at all. Very little support from the HR associate, no information on how to get complaints to upper management, store manager given way too much free time and a huge lack of responsibilities. The pay is decent and the benefits are decent, but not enough to keep me around."
bad,"Management isn't helpful.  They put new people in departments with no training or knowledge of the department.  Frustrating.  It COULD be a fun job, but uncaring, un- knowledge management makes everything difficult on the floor personnel.   One manager tells you to put up a display, 2 hours later another manager tells you to remove it.  Waste of time."
bad,"I thought I was going into a great place to work.  I was wrong. Management problems and company knowingly allowed unprofessional management behavior to go unchecked, which effected multiple employees.  Very sad."
bad,They make you work and do not pay you enough for the work you do for them. Lots of favortism company uses you to the best of their ability. Raises aren't given all the time either
bad,"Don't apply there. It's pointless. Managers are all jokes. You'll hate it. They don't care about everyone, only the ones who suck up. It was a nice place to work in 2012. It changed for the worst"
bad,It was truly an amazing place to work for. Since the newest changes that the company has made has not necessarily been good for the associates. Overall the people who work there are awesome.
bad,"The pay is horrible and there is no room for advancement even with a degree. When hired, they said my season would end in Aug then they changed it to July. While they are ending my employmen,they are hiring more seasonal workers so they don't have to pay them insurance benefits. Scam artists."
bad,"Lowe's is good place to start because you get good Experience  like "
bad,"The management is atrocious and there are some employees all in some kind of inner circle that gets on with some managers. Whoever makes the schedules literally has no idea how to schedule to have coverage for breaks, and just has no clue what is going on. To get anything out of HR takes a miracle. I had a day, maybe two of shadowing and was thrown out into my department with very minimal training and knowledge with a phone, a scanner and a good luck on one of the busiest days of the year. I am not surprised their employee turnover rate is sky high. Do yourself a favor, apply at Home Depot or another retail job before doing this to yourself."
bad,"Management is horrible on all levels is a joke, free range chickens get treated better. "
bad,"Horrible management! Disengagement of the staff especially long term employees ! Training issues ! New Company Restructure is causing  the constant fear of losing jobs results in the loss of ""customer focus"""
bad,"I have been job scared for the past few months With ""Lowe's restructuring 2017"" (google it).  Rumor is now that sales specialist position will be eliminated in October like the Department managers were.  Do not know if I will lose my job or take a big pay cut."
bad,"Limited advancement opportunities. By the time a position is posted they already have their mind made up on who they want in that spot and use the interviews as just fillers. Management will take advantage of those that work hard and make them do work that is above their pay grade. Stores will work seasonal workers over 40 hours a week for over 6 months without moving them to full time status to get their full time benefits. "
bad,Sinking ship. Management is not what it used to be and no one minds their own business do its a house of mess. Hr is a joke she should be at home not speaking for the people.
bad,"People used to put up with the low pay, mediocre benefits, and lack of career progression because Lowe's used to be a family friendly, work-life balanced culture. Since the last layoffs in Feb 2017, what little was left of the trust is gone. Every person on my team is currently looking for jobs elsewhere. All we see is divided vision from the executives who clearly are disconnected to the reality of the slowly wasting away corporate employee pool. We are getting ready for ""round 2"" of layoffs in July. I guess this is what happens when your CEO is an accountant."
bad,"Lowe;s offers great work times, first shift only,6-2;30. Low pay based on the area, poor management. Tm work hard and pull together to get the job done."
bad,"I originally started out at lowes in new jersey and LOVED my team, the environment, the culture, and management. I transfered to Arizona and my experience at this location was the polar opposite. The DM of the front end treated the whole place like high school. She viewed herself as a queen and treated others terribly. Management let her get away with this because she knew more than they did and they needed her help with things. As a result she thought she ran the place and treated everyone as her personal servants and worshipers."
bad,Not flexible at all. cuts hours. only plus side is you get paid sick and vacation days as part time. im just typing stuff cause it said i had too. blah blah
bad,"A typical work day consist of only a few people working and them having to carry everybody else.  Your manager will not manage you in any sort of matter, nor will they help you move up in the company. The feed back you are giving is all negative.  I spent a whole year getting feed back that stated I was doing a great job, but the annual review said I could do anything correctly and that it looked like I need to leave.  The hardest part of the job is working around employees with really bad moral attitudes, and the inability to help each other and work like a team."
bad,"I worked with the company over 5years. They do not care about their associates. It's a sink or swim atmosphere. Their goal is to weed out any associate who is full time or making enough to support a family by replacing them with associates who are unwilling to learn or care about a job beyond their next pay check. The future of this company looks bleak to me. You get what you pay for!"
bad,"The pay is horrible, the full time schedule is atrocious!  I worked hard to learn my position and could never move up or anywhere else.  They said it was because of my interviews where not good?! Funny, I interviewed just fine to get job and it seems I interview well at the other places of employment.  The fact is... if management is against you, you've got no place to go but out!!"
bad,Lowes was terrible for moving up the chain. They always hire from outside instead of promoting within. Store managers threatened your job instead of working with you.
bad,"when you first start they give you an idea of what it will be like to work for Lowe's, career advancement, being able t choose schedules, a work environment bent on helping people love where they work..around 3 months later they throw all that out the window..they do constant lay offs, constantly changing metric requirements..way too stressful of a job.."
bad,There's always changes so the company can save money and with doing so they cut pay roll and it's mostly senior management after years of dedication and time one day ur there the next ur not
bad,No enough structure no manager employee relationships. No morale or career building to advance to a higher level within the company. No review on how or what you are doing right or wrong.
bad,If you didn't fall into the night crews clique you basically worked alone. The manager would always pick on someone if they needed help and the environment was just filled with negativity.
bad,Terrible managers. One of the worst corporation Ive worked for. They will embarass an mock those with disabilities. The associates are rude. They are not great with training either.
bad,Used at be a great place to work that truly cared about is employees. Not anymore it's all about the CEO's bonus. Getting rid of experience in exchange for part time help will be this company's death.
bad,Lowes has a high employee turnover rate with hour and salaried employees. Very high pace work conditions and can be a very stressful environment. Rating this company would not allow me to select no more than a single star in first 4 categories.
bad,No regards for staff and life after work. Change schedule for only those in the clic. Managers have no regard for staff and over work them to the point of exhaustion
bad,"no place for advancement, Not supportive of their employees, only out to take peoples money, liars, Customers are great coworkers are lazy most enjoyable part of the job is when i get to go home"
bad,Working here is ok . But the issue is that at lowes friendship and preference is over really good hard working people. I would not recommend working for lowes in calgary.
bad,A typical day at work would start early in the mornings especially in the hot summer months due to more construction buildings being built. The job was ok difficult scheduling and very heavy lifting at times over and over. The atmosphere of the co workers were of course very opinionated and would talk like they know everything.
bad,As someone new to the company I basically had to teach myself how to do the job. They found reasons to write up everyone around me for every little thing. Then when I complained about an Assistant Manager yelling at people and treating them terrible per the Companies Open Door Policy they started finding reasons to write me up all the time. Managers don't act like leaders they are more like full time associates who are not good at giving direction. If you asked them to teach and train you how to do something they have no idea. They pay way better than every other retailer in my city but yet can't keep associates so that should be your biggest red flag.
bad,Makes you step out of your shell and embraces the greatest place to learn and shop pulling orders will get you
bad,Horrible company to work for that does not care about their employees. Co-workers are great and like a family with a disdain for management.
bad,"Most co-workers are great but say they would jump at the chance to work anywhere else."
bad,First of all the company was doing illegal tax exempt transactions. Even after knowing this the staff continue to do it because they didn't feel it was a big deal. There's a lot of Gossip a lot of drama. The management is very and skilled and has an I don't care attitude. The store manager told us in the company meeting to throw stuff into people's baskets where they were not looking because people are stupid and they wouldn't figure it out anyway at the register. There's no morals no integrity. It explains why there's such a huge amount of turnover. It's a great place for lazy people. And they get away with doing practically nothing for the customer.
bad,this place is very chaotic. Management is poor the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing. Just a horrrible place !
bad,"Worst job I ever had. People on the floor try to do their job and have some fun. But to a person, every worker (excluding management) despise corporate. Frightening. Plus, you will love the morning ""Lowe's cheer""."
bad,"Working at the call center was extremely stressful. Minimal support from management team, constantly berated on the phone, understaffed. We were all eventually laid off because the site was not willing to hire more support staff, and instead outsourced my entire department."
bad,"what they post about this job is completely false...."
bad,"Lowes used to be a good company to work for, fair pay, room for compensation/spiffs and advancement. They used to employ people. Now they only employ bodies, at least that's how management sees it! You mean nothing to the company/managers and they'll prove that to you repeatedly. They're campaigning for ""Lowes Experience of the future"" which just means treating their employees horribly in order to satisfy customers and earn another dollar. Don't get me wrong, this is big-box business in America today. Lowes is no different but they get worse and worse in their treatment of employees and their management, or lack thereof, everday. I'll never go back to this company, no matter what. I cringe at the memories of the 5 years I spent there and I thank God I was able to get out! Education kids, get one so you're not stuck at Blowe's!"
bad,"In all fairness the retail store i work at is a direct reflection of Jacksonville,florida.Its a socially constricted,hostile,angry and non diverse un imaginitive culture.This is being modest.As an Appliance sales specialist i basically sell appliances,however because of understaffing you will find out very soon your title means cover all areas as needed no questions asked.Survival depends on the buddy system of the DELEGATORS!,(managers).There is a pecking order.KNOW this! Its ALL about who likes who based on who does what for the Delagators.The delegators want BONUS MONEY and status,You are the fuel for their desires.You will see MANY Elephants in the room and Most will go ignored.If you are a thinker and problem solver be prepared to surpress those attributes for this is a place for Authoritarians to bask in the splendor of their selfish insecuritys.Enjoy the circus!"
bad,"You cant sweep dust (dirt) with just brooms.  You need a ventilation system.  Also need an oil based compund (recycled money) to keep dust clouds from forming when cleaning the floors.  The place is a pig sty.  Distribution center, Minersville. #961"
bad,"i try my hardest at work to give good customer service to individuals who need it my day consist of packaging, unpacking, stocking, and cleaning."
bad,Don't work here.  Its a terrible place to work. I would never in my life recommend to anyone to work here.  If you currently work here find a different job.
bad,Some of the management there should not be managers at all. They do no know how to treat other coworkers with respect and tend to talk down to them. The PSA Manager that I worked for should not even have the position that she is in without proper training on how to supervise.
bad,Worse place to work!! Your just a # to them and  run you around when they need u then.... then boom your off for days and have bills to pay. Mangers suck just walk around creeping and get paid 5x what we do the just tell us what to do. like lil ants!! Don't work here every!
bad,"long days, no chances for advancement, supervisors and leadership rude esp. if you're new. they say they want to seem as a family but will proceed with actions unlike a family."
bad,"A typical day starts with clearing the work area of trash and heavy appliances, then setting up pallets in preparation for unloading the freight truck and stacking the freight. Also gathering the carts and pallets jacks that will be needed. Preparation time takes about 15-30 minutes. Afterwards, more times than not, the Assistant Store Managers still haven't unlocked the chained warehouse door for the Unload Associates to even start the unload production process. We then have to get on the intercom to notify an ASM which will take them another 5-10 minutes to walk to the receiving area. Management seemed disconnected or maybe they just didn't care due to the fact that the gate was never unlocked for our scheduled shift, we were always undermanned yet we Unload Associates always had to pick up the slack no matter what to get the truck done as fast as possible. Guess what, half way through, tired and all, we still got the ""Not finished yet?"" or the ""Your suppose to be done by now!"" gibberish from ASMs like they forgot we were short manned. Time will tell when you get fed up with this repetitive manual labor position that makes you feel so irrelevant to the point where you feel invisible. My co-workers showed me the ropes and were easy to get along with. It just seemed like they were already disgruntled employees in the misery business and stirring up drama, bickering about others made their time there feel more meaningful.    I wanted to try working at other positions that had more relevance and purpose but the way they treated that particular department made me not want to work"
bad,"Fast paced environment, wonderful co-workers, management, however, was not really supportive.  Best part was working with the Public, met some wonderful people."
bad,"I worked at Lowe's for 2 1/2 years and was a good employee. I called in sick 2 times in that time I worked there and was late 2 times once due to inclement weather and 1 time due to oversleeping."
bad,"This company is not for everyone, the upper management is not real management just people playing mangement, you have to have tough skin and be very head strong. I thank thim for the employment but would never reccomend the company to anyone looking for employment."
bad,"Bad place to work , "
bad,"At Lowes you're a number not a name. It's always, how much more can you do for the company but, very little returned your way. Salary was below average, thank goodness for commissions. But, apparently they've gone away now."
bad,at first give you full time hours and then your hours get cut drastically.management is a joke I know more about running the store then them
bad,"Lowes was very bad experience"
bad,The job overall wasn't bad; the problem was the management and job culture. Never felt safe and secure in my position due to managements habit of letting people go with no notice and really no reason.
bad,"I was bullied badly at Lowes.  Oh did I try to fit in and talk to people.  I made it a part of my day.  I worked so hard there and loved customers and treated them like friends.  I really enjoyed the job and was thrilled to go in each day.  Loved it (at first)."
bad,Use to be a good place to work for till management changed hands.
bad,"Lowes is a large ""big box"" home improvement retailer that manages everything from the home office in North Carolina. There are no surprises. The expectations are articulated thoroughly via meetings and training videos."
bad,"If you work here, be prepared to give up your personal life and to be micromanaged to the breaking point with unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Worked front end and in less than two months went from a happy, friendly employee to a person that dreaded showing up for work. Managers were more concerned with extended protection plan sales than having friendly, competent and dependable employees. They made sure to provide daily lectures to this end. They had no respect for day off requests, even when requested far ahead of time. Shifts were never consistent and be prepared to work every weekend. I wanted a 20 hour work week and was scheduled 30 plus hours every week. One of the worst places I have ever worked!"
bad,"the company is okay and the people there are good, the job is easy but management there is sorry!!!!!! starting from the store manager, there mentality to run a business is very low... then they wanna speak to you if you were there on kid....."
bad,Positions and promotions are given based on who you know in the store or corporation.
bad,Lowe's is a labor intensive and inside political business. They scream about labor cost when their true cost is 8-10% on the net profit. One ASM has been with the company for 12 years and is not a store manager. Their sales environment is not user friendly for the sales specialist even though they expect you to be like a commission rep.
bad,"You will usually be short staff because their whole system is flawed. First, they don't have much of a training system, so you are going to have to deal with a few employees and managers who think they know what they are talking about (construction wise). There really isn't an education requirement so your bosses could end up being uneducated, rude, and very unprofessional."
bad,They say they value your opinion. They say they treat everyone fair. They say they have dignity and show respect. That only applies to the select few who become buddy buddy with managers. If you speak out. You're out......that should be their new slogan.
bad,"The company is Money focused. Bonuses for Management and no one else. They lie to employees and to customers. Management tells me to lie to customers. They do things the way they want to. It's litterally their way or the highway. If they don't like you, your gone! I've worked for Lowes for over 5 years and am and have been looking for a better job for some time. Ive stayed cause the money's not bad but not great and my hours work right now. In all honesty it probably wouldn't be a bad place to work if my whole management team would be fired and I worked Mon-Fri."
bad,I was part of the mass receiving team at the New Westminster location working very long hours. It was very rewarding when we opened the store in November.
bad,"I was hired on shortly after high school. I had driven forklifts, semi trailers, worked construction so I figured it would be an ideal fit while attending college."
bad,They are in the process of getting as much work out of every employee as possible while giving the fewest hours as they can. They will even have several departments being covered by one overexerted employee. People are quitting left and right because we can no longer tolerate this behavior. I'm even looking for a new job this very minute. It wasn't always like this.....
bad,Lowe's is one of the worst places I have worked for work/life balance. Constantly running the store at 50% staff. Working you late every day then complaining about paying you overtime. Would not recommend anyone working for Lowe's
bad,"I worked for them and I have never seen a management team treat their employees the way this location does. When you have a department manager raise his voice and scream at an employee in front of customers, this is not acceptable, especially while a store manager is present. No matter what you do you are too slow for them. You can never please anyone in that department. It does no good to make a call to their human resources department because it goes no where. I have never seen a place that department MANAGERS bully other employees."
bad,"management is horrible, poorly run, no communication, the only thing that was good was working with my co-workers"
bad,The co-workers for the most part are are helpful. I learned you cannot depend on the management team. A typical day is heavy lifting and taking care of customers. I enjoyed taking care of the customers and being a help to them and my fellow employees
bad,"A typical day starts with setting up the paint desk, doing freight going on to inventory replenishment and waiting on customers. Ive learned a great deal on customer needs, paint, and what it means to have great customer service and how to make customers happy.As far as the management team at this store it is constantly changing and there is no leadership. My co-workers are great and we work as a team. The hardest part is the schedual. One day you have to be in at 5:30 am till 3:00pm and the next day you have to be in at 3:00 pm. till 11:00 pm and then 10;00 am the next day till 7pm. They schedual you for 7 days and then get one day off before you work for 4 more days and maybe get 2 days off."
bad,"Shipping, was left alone to overlook 12 doors on my first night there. Management refused me help, even though they had up to 10 people at the ""pallet strip"", which is just putting product on the conveyors. Not ventilated, not good for someone with allergies, or someone who takes allergy medicines. Dramatic high school typed co-workers that act as if the place is a giant soap opera. Management fooled around with their employees, and showed favorites."
bad,"Start the day with restocking shelves, with group morning meetings letting us know what the store made and what they expect all departments to make dollar wise. This is done in front of customers, they keep nothing private. Store manaer does not care about her employees, had problem with coworker with witnesses, manager will make your life miserable and toss problem out door. As for promotions, you may as well forget it. Example: If you been there for years and do a good job and would like to move up, they will not do it. Will promote people who have been there for 3 months and goof off.All stores operate the same way. I do not recommend anyone to to apply,"
bad,"I believe Lowe's is a good Company, but not at the North Vernon Distribution Center. The upper management tends to be disconnected to the hourly team members as well as the coaches. New management has made the facilty a very unhappy place to work."
bad,"Lowe's (the store I was at) is a horrible place to work. They don't follow company policy so I can't say the company as a whole is bad, it could be the location I was at. People are treated horribly. They pay is low. Management has no people skills. Overall a really bad experience."
bad,This Company has poor management and human resources and does not know how to schedule people for there departments or hire someone for departments.
bad,"Here is the list of problems that happened within the store when i was an associate."
bad,"The manager for delivery didnt know how to do her job. Was promoted because of favoritism, no actual knowledge about the job. The customer was always right no matter what, even when the customer lies they get what they want lowe will bend over backwards to please a customer but screw an employee"
bad,"As a flatbed driver I was the only person who knew how to do my job. Managers would tell me to do things that were impossible time and load wise  Salespeople were just out for commission "
bad,There are managers that aren‚Äôt helpful when attempting to get help from them. There are a lot of associates who come to work high & do unethical things & have been getting away with it for awhile. I think they just don‚Äôt care as long as someone is there. You‚Äôre over worked tremendously because it‚Äôs extremely short handed which makes it a stressful place to work. Store Mgr seems to care but he can sneaky which makes it hard to trust him
bad,No matter how hard you work it goes unrecognized. Most people there are very lazy. There no leadership or management. But on the other hand they will work with your schedule so long as its under 12hrs a week. No advancement and no raises even after a year of work with them.
bad,"Unless you are a full time (specialist) you dont get benefits. The hours are never constant, constantly working 7-8 day straights with one day off, then called in on your day off. If you have children this is not a place to work."
bad,"Bad management"
bad,I think lowes treats their staff horrible .ive been closing 3 months straight and they don't care about my family that I have no time for .i get no help from anyone on this .when I applies I waa told I was required to close2 nights a week .niw they have changed it and I close every night .its not right its not equal oppurtuniy .employmeent.
bad,Use to be a great please to work. It has gone way downhill. They are turning into a different type of business and I am not looking forward to working there anymore. Way too much favoritism
bad,Do not know what to say really just been working Well trying to and get shoot hours  what else do I need to write   What I have to say doesn‚Äôt take 150 characters
bad,"The main problem with Lowe's is incompetent management. They never hire enough people, they constantly tell you to do the most stupid of tasks, and down right don't understand what they're doing."
bad,"Lowes doesnt care about its employees. When I first started working there the slogan was ""Retire a millionaire"". And it was true. We made great money and stocks. Slowly but surely they have stripped the general employees of all its incentives and benefits."
bad,"The management is run by a guy that is great at hiring people from church and is not equipped for the job responsibilities."
bad,"At first I thought this company was Amazing, but my supervisor walked out and because he wasn‚Äôt doing his job our OM decided to audit our team. She went back and pointed every member of my team and we all were on the brink of pointing out. Mind you this was my first supervisor and I thought this is how the company was. If you have a woman Om just walk away she is horrible. Standards are high pay is low and they give everyone the dream of moving up but you can only move up if your in ta click"
bad,Lowe's  is a place where they  tell you to lie to the customers. They don't treat the customer's right regarding their appliances. I was repair specialists at the call center. I worked there for 2 years my first  year raise was 18 cent. I knew it was time to go.  The second year I was looking for a job elsewhere  that would appreciate my hard work. It's stressful and by the time you leave work you're in a bad mood. If you go to work there anyway please stay to yourself.
bad,Nothing to great about this place. Training sucked when I was there. Co-workers were not the nicest. Trying to get time off was a nightmare. I wouldn't work there again.
bad,Numerous management changes in the stores creates a very stressful work environment.  The system upgrade do not offset the reduction in payroll.  Every year you must work harder to get the same results
bad,Going through a lot of changes. Management looks out for itself. Not enough employees put on schedule. Everyone feels overworked. Afraid my position will be eliminated like a lot of other ones were.
bad,"The concerns are with District staff, the stores are better off left alone or have district staff pitch in and assist the stores with tasks.  Team work is not high on their list as real.  They think everyone is a nail and they are the hammer"
bad,Poor management and very poor work ethic with some co workers. A lot of people pass the buck but mainly it‚Äôs good work. Management makes it very hard to work here
bad,"In the 19 years I worked there have been through a lot of changes but this last year was the worst which is why I no longer work there.  The new CEO has deleted many job positions, changed the schedule rotations and many other morale killing changes.  People are quitting every week."
bad,"Management shows favoritism. They will continue for months and months thinking you are doing something right. Then fire you and tell you that you violated policy, and will fail to tell you what policy you broke. Different rules apply to different people. They will punish one person and make sure of it while another person who does the exact same thing don‚Äôt. Favoritism. Management will change your schedule and not inform you to fit there needs outside of work."
bad,Very low morale customers unhappy about the lack of service. Managers are only out for themselves. No support from management.  Not enough coverage to help customers
bad,Very poor management not coverage through out building on a daily basis. No management seemed to try or create plan to correct this issue. Making it hard to do your job and management always blamed staff
bad,Management leaves all to employees. continual staffing restructures leaves a lot to be said about job security. Good pay and good insurance but overall job not somewhere I‚Äôll ever return unless I‚Äôm old and need part time
bad,"Good job, paid well but not worth the garbage you have to deal with through management. If you aren't part of their possy then you're a nobody & get treated terribly. Very immature management!"
bad,Surprisingly they have a hurry up and wait mentality for everything. The store I work for has a major issue with staffing. They don‚Äôt move proper people to proper departments for them because of being short staffed. Which leads to unhappy workers and the general population of good employees tend to leave the store and they cycle through terrible seasonal employees who they don‚Äôt thoroughly go through to see if they will work good for the place they are stuck into
bad,"I took a LOT of pride in taking care of the building & grounds (FSA). New CEO comes in and replaces us with a 3rd party. Noting (his own father held a position like ours) and still gave no notice, wonder what Dad thinks. My job was my retirement job. at 61 I had 8 years of service in Lowes. The pay stunk but I was able to do side jobs to compensate living here beachside.(I'm single) The hours were consistent (the only good job to have) so I knew I could schedule other work during the week. They promised I would have another job similar PSA so I did not sign up for unemployment, They said the 20th of August would be the come back date. I applied, told my SM I'm ready and waiting, nothing. I finally call on the 19th and the position was filled (by someone who shows up with his arm in a sling). Go figure. Yea, I'm hurt, and mad. I actually thought that the people I busted butt for cared about me. Wrong! "
bad,The culture of the store is to employee part time associates only with no knowledge of product. I don't recommend people even shop there anymore. Management wants nothing to do with customer interaction let alone speak to an employee with their open door policy. Though you have vacation time they often deny time off  while management is always off weekends. Stay away
bad,Going under a new CEO Lowe‚Äôs is not a stable place to work and it‚Äôs getting more stressful as the days progress. Do not work here. They are cutting jobs left and right.
bad,"This company from day one, will throw you to the wolves.  Little training,  but very demanding. "
bad,"I‚Äôd rather not list anything in reference to reviewing lowes. Every store is different . So my opinion would be biased, stores also have the potential of changing."
bad,"Typical retail atmosphere. Fast paced, and understaffed but you‚Äôll always be busy doing something. If high speed work environment is for you then you‚Äôll enjoy it"
bad,No one has your back. Can‚Äôt trust anyone. Corporate is about corporate not about the associates who deal with the public day in and out. Upper management will not take a stand for an associate for fear of getting written up
bad,"Lowes has the opportunity to be a great place to work, however the vaguely written policies have made it to where managers will use special treatment for who they like and will apply ""made up"" policies for people they dont like. Managers do not hide their special treatment."
bad,"Steady hours, decent pay but absolutely horrible management, rarely ever get help when you ask, you get managed by cameras that take pictures and get talked to like you‚Äôre scum, all of the managers besides maybe two are always on a control/power trip, if they don‚Äôt like you no matter how good of a worker you are they will do everything in their power to make you quit. I wish corporate would see what actually happens at this store and take action but sadly that will never happen"
bad,"I enjoy working here.  However, I've been denied several applications for promotions, lateral moves, even demotions; passed over for new hires and others."
bad,"You will work with some great people, who are willing to help others. Some just collect a paycheck, and could care less about customers or safety. Make of it as you will."
bad,Its a job. This particular lowes was so poorly managed. So much turnover. One manager says do this. Another that. And in the end you did both. Its great if you enjoy standing around and gossiping but if you have an actual work ethic its not for you.
bad,"No leadership pretty much all the way up the chain of command, workers stresses and overload in all areas of the store, incentives were great when I started, now next to nothing."
bad,"Its a ok work environment not the best it all depends what department you work in. i learned how to mix paint, management is ok, some employees are good to get along with than others, hardest part of the job is lifting appliances that were shipped to receiving, most enjoyable part of the job interacting with the customers"
bad,it was an ok work place I enjoyed my time while I was there and I definitely loved my contractors and they loved me. It was a fairly easy job but I was also good at what I did
bad,This company has issues at the management level and needs to take a step back a reevaluate their goals to hire better personnel. Loyalty is not their strong point
bad,"work schedule all over the place, day shift then mid-shift, evening shift ending at 11:00pm. Management will walk all over you then walk away."
bad,"They hire poorly qualify managers, even store managers. That don't make productive decision, to create a well balance work environment. When you use the chain of command, to from your complaint. It will only be a waste of time, because they choose and back up their favorite employees and any cost."
bad,"I worked for this company 16 years I am a veteran and one day I was brought into an office and told (very coldheartedly )""as of right now you no longer are employed by lowes"" I was Floored I was given no chance to transfer position or anything. They told me I can reapply at a later date gave me a severance pay and out the door I was sent .I've tried for a month to get rehired and was passed up many times"
bad,"Lowe's is boring and does not run the company well as losing lots of money from being open so late and opening so early, and barely any breaks are allowed. Typical day at work is I come in make my department look good and help customers. Manager gives a lot of busy annoying work that does not need to be done."
bad,I have been in this type of business and environment before. The way this store is being run makes you feel like you're nothing but a body there to take the customers away from the management team so they can go back to talking about whatever they feel like.  You can forget about getting help from any of them. Most of the time they are running bragging about who sleeping with who in the store.  And yes that was and is probably still happening now.
bad,"I and some of my co-workers were harassed by a manager and none of the managers listened or cared, even though that manager had been removed from another store and transferred to my store for harassing employees. They told us to just ""keep the peace"". After this they ""promoted"" me out of the department without a pay raise and expected me to be grateful to get away from the manager."
bad,That was bad enough but for them to tell you the same day that. Today is your last day and your insurance ends today was very unprofessional! And left no time for someone to tey to find another job
bad,"Extremely unorganized and stressful."
bad,"I worked at Lowes Distribution for 3.5 years. In that time I had been one of the most productive employee in the facility."
bad,"Never work for Statesboro Lowe's. Every manager, including the store manager, talks badly about employees and they do not care about you/your health, or your personal problems. They just want to know if you're coming to work or not. And if you don't come to work they talk so badly about you to everyone. The whole store will know why you called out even if it's a personal reason. Very unprofessional place!"
bad,No one was ever treated fair at this place. Clicks were made and managers have their faves. Cashiers were treated like nobodies and were talked to with so much disrespect. Jr didn't do any help either
bad,"Outside of the job most folks think Lowe's is a great place. Working for the company you find it's a facade. 1st off, the schedule is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. They work the full time employees 6 days on, 1 day off, 4 days on, 1 day off, 4 days on, 1 day off, 3 days on 2 days off, 3 days on, and 2 days off, then repeat. So in 16 days you have 2 days off. I understand the way a business operates, it wants to put out as much worth, with the least heads, the least pay, the least time. Thats how the money is made but, you can't expect your employees to complete 12-15 hours worth of work in an 8 hour shift.. its expect to complete a said amount but your shift alone isn't enough time to complete it. More barriers or hoops are created to add additional time to complete tasks which make it a bicious circle of late days never ending."
bad,The management  is getting paid alot of money an they don't do nothing an treat the customer real nasty .They don't help the customer  they'll come get a cashier to run the paint  dept instead of helping they'll let the customer  just stand there an ring the help button. They show alot of favoritism  an there customer service service is  horrible. I work
bad,"I was employed for a little over one month. I was the Freight Flow/Receiving/ Delivery Manager. Three  Full-time Positions into one. My schedule was 2am till 11am.  A little over a month I was written up because deliveries were not leaving on time.  At the time I had not had a delivery Cooridatior who is to pull all scheduled deliveries, call customers that day before and the day of and set up routs."
bad,Poor leadership..  half way through your shift they pull you in the office and tell you that your position is being eliminated.  And on the way back they‚Äôre joking and laughing.  I even asked if my position was being eliminated (two others were earlier in the day) and he said no.  Lied right to me.
bad,Very unstable. I loved working there until the day they had the manager cutbacks. We were told here is you severance package. I had over 20 years management and home improvement experience. We were not offered another position.
bad,"I worked there for over a year but left in 2017. The pay is great. Don‚Äôt remember many benefits for part time if at all any. The management wasn‚Äôt that great, there wasn‚Äôt a good management system in place. Unless management has changed since I was last there. If you‚Äôre looking for good pay then I recommend it only for that."
bad,Amazing coworkers but customers are horrible and management treats you like a robot ‚Äî nothing to work eight days in a row all over the place in terms of hours with one day off and another five day stretch (but somehow it‚Äôs legal?? It‚Äôs a computer generated schedule and nobody fixes it to make sense ‚Äî always issues)‚Äî always back to back open/close shifts with 11 hours between shifts multiple times a week ‚Äî NOT family friendly working environment‚Äî management WILL lie to get good work out of you today but screw you over tomorrow. Top heavy corporations
bad,"Taking care of Customers and my job personally was enjoyable. "
bad,"Lowe's in Stuart is like an upside down pyramid. Nobody know which way is up. Favoritism is huge in this store. Managers do not want to help, it is all a big joke. The CEO keeps changing policies and days off and is very inconsistent. A lot of people are leaving Lowe's because it is too stressful to work there now with all of the changes and uncertainty. They have laid a lot of people off. If you are required to sell and you do not make more than what you're supposed to make, they will write you up."
bad,brought in terrible store manager and assistant store manager worst management  I ever saw over my 50 year career. culture became very poor after new manager took over
bad,Marvin Ellison and his posse are slowly destroying a company for his personal vendetta for Home Depot passing him up as CEO. He worked as CEO of HC Penneys until his no compete clause expired. He cant change a 70 year corporate culture into a clone of Home Depot. The good talent is leaving for higher positions elsewhere. They are bringing in old HD leaders their prime. In 3 trars Anazpn  prime
bad,"At lowes there is one thing you can be sure of, and that is there is no guarantee that you will have a job tomorrow. Everything at lowes is about making their investors happy not you as an employee you mean absolutely NOTHING to them........"
bad,Once you put in over 10 yrs..watch out. No job security. The young kids come in and don't know how to work. They have friends as managers so they get away with stuff. The employee's steal all the time and get away with it because management looks away.  It's now how you work it's who you know..horrible place. Oh and the men discriminate if women know more than them. Joke
bad,"This was not a very good experience and I would advise anyone to think twice about a position at Lowe‚Äôs . The culture is terrible, they have no respect for the employees in the workplace.  The benefits are decent full time and pay was t too bad but other than that this is not a good company at all to work for!"
bad,"If you're an unloader, find another job. Management is beyond poor. They tell you to cover other peoples areas and then go stand around and talk to them. Some people are forced to work and some are let to just stand there staring at their phone all day. If you're an unloader you are the bottom of the pole and they will treat you accordingly. I can't stress this enough... MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE! They have no idea what they, you, or anyone is doing. But they'll take credit for it when you get a task done!. Ughhh"
bad,"Horrible job, night stockers get blamed for everything. We are expected to kill ourselves for 5 straight days. I was unappreciated , managers would lie in your face. I was getting paid less than what I deserved. I would consider myself a hard working dedicated ex-employee of Lowe‚Äôs but the manager i had for my night stocking would cause problems instead of fixing problems. I got fired because she thought I was a threat"
bad,If you work here or want to work here DO NOT voice your opinion or seem at all invested in the company they will walk all over you. The more you do the less you get paid especially if you happen to be female. Management is threatened by any employee who seems to think for themselves. They want people to that don't ask questions and to basically be mindless and do as they say regardless of the sense it makes.
bad,The pay is competitive but the work environment its really terrible. The company is not effective and you will notice that they only copy whatever home depot does.
bad,"They do not follow company procedures. "
bad,"This company has changed drastically in the last year and no thought was put into how these changes would affect things operationally. Over time has been cut almost as a whole company wide so associates are burnt out and scrambling to get things done which leaves customer service on the back burner, which then of course stores are reprimanded for poor customer service scores. You will be scheduled most holidays as the store is only closed two days a year (Christmas, Thanks Giving) and you will only be able to use your vacation time (only full timers get it) during the winter because most summer/spring requests are denied by management. ASM's throw all their work onto under paid department sup's and market management makes constant surprise visits leaving everyone feeling like they are going to be caught with their pants down at any moment. Honestly most people in my store are miserable."
bad,"A very poorly ran store.  The store manager drives the good employees down with constant criticism and extensive work hours.  The store is very understaffed, with the good employees always being tasked to cover the unmanned hours, even the assistant managers."
bad,"I started out as a full-time seasonal cashier. Everybody liked me and till I got hired part time per minute. I was moved around the store and I advanced to full-time with two new positions, customer service and telephone operator. And then the rumors begin that I was slandering and using racial slurs which is not true. It happened to bother one of the head cashiers that I was working in a room sitting down . "
bad,"They typically hire seasonal associates to help. The starting pay is good but you won't get over 20 hours per week.  During the process of getting hired it specifically says the seasonal position may last up until August. They basically use seasonal employees to achieve their goal to get a big bonus! The managers starting from the store manager to the front end managers are horrible. They walk right past you and won't acknowledge you at all!! If a customer has a complaint some tend to offer bad customer service. I witnessed one manager encourage a customer to go to Home Depot. At Lowe's they have better prices, bad attitudes & is all about making their sales for their region! Customers walked out numerous times with hundreds of dollars worth of tools the security for Lowe's in Houma is ridiculous!"
bad,"You will be on a rotating shift from the hours of 5am to 11pm. Seven day a week, with one weekend off about every two months. Days off may not be back to back. Staffing is kept at a minimum, largely for sales/ budget/ bonus reasons and is increasingly difficult to fill positions to the point that you are routinely short staffed. "
bad,As a sales associate i am use to working hard. they are lacking hiring enough people to work their and they don't have people scheduled right to fill a whole shift for a day. Because of that they would most likely overwork their employees.
bad,"This position needs to be full time. You cant do a weeks worth of deliveries on 25 hours a week. Uses 25 year old technology that needs a complete overhaul. There is no inventory system, people sell appliances that aren't in stock, and its somehow deliveries fault. You dont get health insurance, they offer you preventive care, which is only allowed at doctors care. If they have to cut hours, yours are first cut, without notice because you are part time. The drivers are great to work with, but they get burned out easily. Management expects 12 or more deliveries a day in 8 hours or less."
bad,"Lowes is going through a lot changes.  I have been here a few years. There is no schedule flexibility for full time employees. Most people are hired seasonally or part time and thrown on the the floor with inadequate training.Most new employees are there less than a month. Management is uncoordinated and you often have 4 managers telling you different things. Management often uses yelling rather than planning, preparing and leading . Understaffing is the norm before employee call outs."
bad,First day was ok came in early had restrooms/garbage taken care of before store opened. The following days had me coming in at noon to clean while open. Idk. Started training on daily duties then trained on how to work a register. Had me computer training on safety for a few minutes to be taken to help another department. Kept getting pulled away from one thing to another. All from different ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù. They didn‚Äôt know that the other had me doing something already.
bad,"Lowes as a company isn‚Äôt a bad company. However, the people in charge are some of the most incompetent people I have ever met. The management doesn‚Äôt hold themselves accountable for their actions."
bad,"Company is trying to do too many things at once and it is not being smoothly executed."
bad,They say they are going to change your position and then when you apply they will deny you that position. Anytime you refer anyone to work there they never hire them management is not that bad it's just you never get any help when its needed
bad,"Your sift is never consistent. They often schedule your two days off separate from each other e.g. you have Mondays and Thursdays off. Work every single weekend. No consistency in times, you could work a few days 6-3 and then switch to 2-11 or a 10-7. No work/life balance. Management doesn't care for employees."
bad,Lowe's is struggling and will continue to struggle. They have accepted mediocrity for so long; they no longer have a choice. The company is infested with the wrong kinds of management and suffers from a lack of leaders.
bad,I worked there for about 3 years . There were a few managers who worked with my schedule  . Pay was ok saw a lot of sideways stuff. I still have a few friends  that work there.  I saw a few hard working people and they got the brunt of the work .
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is a good company, at least they used to be. Now stores such as 1830 promotes an atmosphere of stealing from customers online orders and canceling them just to resale on eBay. I cant be around this activity anymore. I spent over 20hrs a week inside the stores and witnessed this. Enough is enough‚Äô"
bad,They are very unprofessional at Lowe‚Äôs of brenham texas. I do not recommend any one to that Lowe‚Äôs there management is horrible and the customer service is as well
bad,"Lowes has become an example of corporate greed and dividends to shareholders. Customers are increasingly aware and dissatisfied with the lack of real customer service and appreciation. Poor service is a result of a constant influx of temporary workers, part timers who have no ability to advance, store management being micro managed by corporate, crucial and critical decisions are made 350 miles away, hard work and initiative not rewarded, promotion given to favorites and incompetent employees, those who do have a work ethic and take pride in their performance are grossly taken advantage of by other workers and management. Horrible communication, incredibly outdated DOS computer system that makes fulfilling an 11.00 dollar internet order a task of over an hour searching for stock."
bad,"Lowe's doesn't work with their management team at all for career development. Once you become a Service Manager/Dept Supervisor you're stuck. Regular associates are treated better than the management team. They have better hours and some are even paid more than the managers. It's sad when Drivers make an equal amount to the managers, yet managers are held to a higher standard and deal with all of the irate customers. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend Lowe's to anyone to work there. Poorly manage. Management very rarely done there jobs at keeping sertrine employees on task. They always preached team work. But I got jumped by an ASM for been in receiving helping unload an appliance truck. My job pulling orders was done for the rest of the week. But all she said is what are you doing  back here. That was what drove me to quit
bad,Lowes was a very bad place to work. Went through many supervisor changes and offered to be moved up multiple times but every time I would ask I would be blown off and told to answer phone calls and I was on break. Supervisor would only speak once a week. Went without a sync up for months so never knew how metrics were. Pay was great. Benefits were great but always found myself dreaded to work here. Too much favoritism and way to much false hope supervisors would give to employees trying to get somewhere.
bad,This company's expectations and demands are beyond stressful for the limited amount they actually pay. They are very poor at communication and they are very inconsistent. They are last minute planners and a very stressful place to work for. I would never recommend anyone work for them.
bad,"Low pay, raises are horrible!! Have to work two jobs to pay bills. Management pawns all their work to everyone else. Always saying sorry to customers because the store is always out of merch.Moral is horrible!! Everyone has it's ""not my job"" attitude. Management is not reliable when it comes to helping with something. If you just want to get by in life and not grow as a person then lowes is for you. If you want better things in life and grow in a company stay away from this company!!"
bad,Not a good place to work mangement on nights is horrible they put your back against the wall !Work should be eviromently safe and fun .And it‚Äôs definetly not that not all shifts is like this but I would not recommend working in night shift whit or black it‚Äôs a slave plantation !!
bad,Too many decisions made by people who have no idea about how they affect anything and not enough pay or hours to support any sort of lifestyle. Decisions that caused product to become damaged were retracted only to be put right back in place with different product with the same results; product becoming damaged.
bad,i really dislike working for lowes i couldnt get off the manger wasnt good he had me doing his work and i wasnt getting paid to do mangers work found a better opportunity and left
bad,Angry people - Management shorts the staff by not hiring to save money to enhance their annual bonus.  Employees are stressed and angry because they are overworked and expected to do the work of 2 people because they are so short staffed.  Management targets those that cannot do the work of 2 people.  Management targets those that have maxed their hourly wage to eliminate and cut costs by replacing with employees that are paid substantially less.  Employees are so stressed out they target and back stab each other.
bad,Lowes was very difficult to work for. You would go on deliveries and not know how to put appliance together and managements attitude was just get it there. They scheduled deliveries with the flatbed to area where the truck was not allowed to be because of weight limits and again it was just get it there
bad,"When I just started at Lowe's I was happy with the starting pay. They took my college degree into account and my previous work experience so my starting hourly wage was great no complains there. Unfortunately, no matter how much my hourly wage was my checks were not  good as I would get scheduled 15 hours a week sometimes even less some days I was scheduled for 2 hour shifts. I waited it out to see if things got better but they didn't positions would open up but they promote based on seniority not education or experience which is unfortunate as I had more managerial experience and a higher education level than the hiring manager. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to a person with a family if you're a college kid living with your parents I would say yes other than that no."
bad,"boys club "
bad,"This career is not recommended for working professionals. the workplace culture does not promote respectful, long-term positive working environment. If you're looking for a place to build confidence in a job well done, build respect for yourself over time and gain skills... this place is not for you."
bad,"Lowe's was, once upon a time, a very good employer for which to work.  However, over the last 10 years, a ""Bottom-line"" mentality has taken over and corporate management's only concern seems to be increasing Lowe's stock price to the level of Home Depot's stock price.  Unfortunately, this is being done on the backs of the employees.  Sales commissions were eliminated years ago..  Quarterly bonuses, which were once so common as to be taken for granted, are now based on metrics that are obviously designed to allow management to hand out bonuses MUCH less frequently and thus greatly reduce the amount of money the company is paying out.  Under-staffing is rampant.  Employee dissatisfaction is widespread.  Staff turnover is constant.  And though employees work on a scheduled rotation, daily shifts constantly change, making a stable home life difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.   Local store management is ineffective and those managers are mostly concerned with surviving overly long, overly stressful work days (as are the rest of the employees).  On a positive note, Lowe's still offers decent benefits (including health) and that's why most employees are there.  (Or they're in a small market where job opportunities, even in this booming economy, are few.)  Plus, Lowe's has a decent (but not great) pay scale. However, once you hire on, your yearly pay increases can be minimal (as little as 3 cents an hour). But, while Lowe's continues to increase the pay scale, which is great, that means new hires are almost always hired in at a rate higher than long-term employees are earning,"
bad,It would seem as though that customer satisfaction would be of utmost importance but according to the store managers. Making sales are more important. They always preach the customers choice needs to be important but they always put quantity over quality.
bad,"The amount of work you put into the lumber department and only get paid low, not enough to work on my days off , it was the point of not getting paid enough .Corp stinks and they wonder why their losing employees left and right . And getting paid by weekly stunk"
bad,"As an Assitant Store Manager at Lowe‚Äôs you are required to work and scheduled for 55 hours. Your pay is based on 40 hours though. The market directors and market team treat you like you are insignificant. You are also on call 24 hours a day and there are many times when you are required to go to the store for alarms in the middle of the night. You can not spend holidays with families as all Holidays besides Christmas are black out dates. ( Memorial Day, Labor Day, 4th of July, Easter, and Thanksgiving the store is closed but Black Friday you may have to be there at 2am so no out of town travel.) Your entire life will be consumed with Lowes and then when they have an issue with you it isn‚Äôt discussed they don‚Äôt want to hear your side...you get written up and terminated. Other associates you manage you have to jump through hoops to get documented for work performance."
bad,"If you cannot work days, or full time do not expect a fair shake at lowes. Front End Management avoids responsibilities, and allows for other employees to take advantage and not show up to work with no discipline only problem is their duties are now yours. Example- Coworker went to lunch and never returned, no call or explanation manager ""You don't need a break do you or a lunch?"" due to not being staffed well enough cover this person leaving. "
bad,"The managers run the store on a skeleton crew, there are at any point in time at least 20 customers per 1 service rep so you can never find the help you need and it's understandable that customers leave at that point. The previous store manager hired overpaid and underexperienced teenagers and early 20 year olds for all manager roles and the store is showing it. Lack of reliable leadership lead to me taking on many of their roles and getting paid $10 an hour less for it."
bad,I would go in at 4am to scan the store with it's outs. And then i had to do a report and hand it out to my co worker's so that they could fill their shelves. When i was done i would help with the price changes.I started out as a cashier.
bad,The drama was unreal. Management never backed anything you said or never backed anyone. No room for advancement if you were not a favorite of a manager. Hours sucked used to work way to many ‚Äúclopens‚Äù which means work 1-10pm then 6:30am to 3:30pm the next day. Head cashiers have nothing but bad attitude and do little to no work while customer service does all their work for them. Will most definitely never work for Lowes ever again I wasted 3 years of my life to get nowhere even when the management team kept saying they wanted to make me part of the head cashier management team. Ended up working for a competitor called Runnings as a head cashier and I live this job so much more!
bad,"I would never work there again"
bad,Poor communication between managers and disrespect toward anyone who isn't a manager. This company states that they are an equal opportunity employer. This is a false statement.
bad,"When I first started working at Lowes I thought this would be a good job to work for until I found a much better job, unfortunately I learned the hard way about the horrors of working at Lowes.  Horrible managers, always cutting hours, the workers they have the maturity level of high shoolers.  You'd be lucky to even get 25 hours a week as part time.  Management will always find a way to cut employees hours.  Lowes practically frown upon upon taking breaks and if you work outside, be sure to bring a water bottle with you, they frown upon going inside to use the bathroom and to get a drink."
bad,"Was looking to get back into the workforce after being laid off, started with Lowes.  Management was not good.  Was told breaks were not guaranteed.  Stuck it out for 3 months."
bad,"Where do I start...the main issue that all drivers share is the rollout of a program called ‚Äúclick‚Äù which basically has a central dispatch office out of state operating the routes and scheduling of trucks without knowing the geography of where you are. So you can potentially be doing deliveries for stores 2 hours away from you. Not only that but because of drive time the dispatch office and managers would take time away per delivery to be able to cram more deliveries on in case of irate customers. Basically you come in for a shift at 7 or 11 and they are expecting you to already be at your first customer...it is impossible to ever leave the store on time, you are expected to locate and pull your deliveries AND unbox everything and that‚Äôs if you can actually find have the stuff so don‚Äôt expect to leave the store till about an hour or more after you clock in. No matter what your behind everyday you come in. It got so bad we held a meeting with corporate higher ups prepared with driver statements explaining the issues we have on a daily basis and all we got or if it was ‚Äúwell unfortunately that‚Äôs the scope of the work‚Äù. It‚Äôs ridiculous what this company puts its workers through, there is absolutely no work life balance it‚Äôs 10% life 90% lowes. We lost 3 great drivers in two months cause they got sick of which I don‚Äôt blame them but now because of short staffing they are expecting me and the only other driver to pick up the slack. STAY CLEAR OF THIS JOB!"
bad,"To start off with, there isn't any training. They place you in a position and expect you to be able to do your job within a month because you worked side by side with another employee (not a manager or supervisor). It takes forever to get power equipment training, which that's what you need to do your job. So they expect you to shelve boxes over your head (5 feet to 10 feet) weighting (1 lbs to several lbs) by climbing ladders several times. Advancement is a joke! it's who you know, not what you know. I have seen employees you just started with Lowes ( 4 months) and move through the ranks faster then employees who have been there for years. The structure is horrible, no one wants to fix the problem, all they want to do is point the finger to each other. Why have managers if they are not going to do their job. People get away with anything there, Late to work, eating up the clock and not working, Not working at all and walking around while others are busting their butt. When you bring this to the  managers attention, it goes by deaf ear. Ever department and ever shift talks about each other and points the finger. No one wants to do their job in management but collect a check. If corporate really wants to know what's going on in their stores, speak to the people that really care (the employees that work)."
bad,"When I first started working at Lowes under management things were good,after management change went down hill and never recovered, I dreaded walking through the door everyday to go to work as every other employee felt the same way."
bad,"HR is unavailable. No support from managers or above. Consistently understaffed and ill equipped. Lowe's is the epitome of modern, corporate nonsense."
bad,"I worked at Lowe's for 14 years. The last 5 were the worst. Management gave very little, if any positive feedback to employees. There was a lot of negativity circulating throughout the store."
bad,I worked at Lowes for almost 13 years. In the beginning it was great but over the years employee morale dropped tremendously  because of poor management.
bad,"Having started with Lowes before the current CEO took over, it was a place you could build a careeer, after however, you were a body and had no value."
bad,"poor management and staffing, needs to put store managers through evaluations for mental health.  poor business decisions by a fortune 50 company....."
bad,As long as you don't mind working with lazy people and poor managers it is an ok job. Managers just walk around and will not help unless begged! Very two faced managers and the open door policy is a joke. I had not had a raise in over 5 years!
bad,"Early start sometimes 6am, busy helping customers, and stocking shelves with forklift.  Learned that there are many names for one tool.  Training was min."
bad,"Discrimination, no equal pay, does not care about employees and does not promote minority growth. "
bad,"all i can say is Lowes is stuck on management   boy do they all kiss each other's butts and its disgusting   the way the treat the employees is insane let alone the customer   lead the employee on and NOT produce what they said they were going to do unless the employee threatens to leave or something extreme   and these employees were actually good workers, jumped through hoops for them  they weren't someone like me who just showed up and tried not to work..."
bad,Stressful environment where customers are rewarded for treating employees like garbage in order to get whatever they want. No backing from management when trying to uphold corporate policies and no support when dealing with abusive customers. Very little corporate loyalty and one can never be sure when a position will be eliminated with no notice.
bad,The management at the location I worked had no professionalism.  this was the worst experience of my working life.  they treated people like they were idiots and that included the customers.  Archaic technology and management practices.
bad,"These people will work you till you bleed if you can. Avoid this place. Management is terrible, they have no regard or respect for the position that you were hired in and have no problem working you for minimum wage."
bad,Company was great place to work for initially. Today's Lowes is no where close to what Lowes was when it had good leadership. Lowes management is now only worried about making bonus for THEMSELVES. They really do not care about employee's who make a  true contribution to the company ( taking care of the customer).
bad,"I started out as a temp. Made it to a part time associate. Then when i applied for full time, everything changed. Management wanted me to do a job i was not being paid for. When i said enough is enough, they cut my hours and would send people to me that didnt need anything in my department. The closer it got to christmas the worse it got. If you work here in the spring, its okay. After that, run for the hills!"
bad,Managment is a joke.they hire low class installers and don‚Äôt support their sales people. Installer constantly messing up projects and managers let them get away with murder!
bad,You to be a good company until they got the corp. greed thing going on. The management is poor and they do not do any work at all.They are not consistent with discipline.
bad,"Metrics are unreasonable, and they are the ONLY thing that matters.  Customers don't matter and neither do employees."
bad,The workers get over worked and the do notthings get left alone.Hr is not there to be a go between. Hr  only there to help managers bully the workers.
bad,A female threatened male coworker with work place violence and falsely accusing of inappropriate harassment. Management was informed and did nothing about it.
bad,Meet two of most amazing people/co-workers but other than that is just a job. Pay is a joke and management is typical with the do more for less attitude. No performance based incentives so work as hard as you like you get paid as much as the slackers do.
bad,"I worked for Lowe's CPO as a Project Exterior Coordinator. The job intel on a typical work day."
bad,Working for this company has become  stressful  due to the fact of all the job cuts.The keep cutting jobs and different ways to make everyone to do more and still take care of the customer
bad,This wouldn't be a bad company except that they don't care about their associates. It doesn't matter if there isn't enough people to do the job or how many customers you have you need to get all your work done. Their expectations are unrealistic and stressful.
bad,They do offer a bonus program but they are making it impossible to make your numbers to get your bonus. They don't want to pay out the monthly bonus anymore because they are constantly over budget. The do nothing about what the team members need. They only accommodate the hire ups. They hire people to tell you how to do your job but they have never done it and they don't understand why they're way won't work. They are just an overall shady company.
bad,"Typical day at work is fast paced."
bad,it is ad what lack of decisive leadership can do to a company. Lack of leadership following every passing market trend completely forgetting what your company did well to begin with. Finally ending with a total loss of all competent employees.
bad,very poor management with very little knowledge. Most people are just in wrong positions and a lot of people that should be promoted never got that chance because management gave the jobs to people they wanted there not who deserved the position
bad,"assist customers, load  run equipment stock freight."
bad,"The management wasn't that great, customers would have to wait an outstanding amount of time for little things. Nobody seemed to care about the well being of the customer nor made them want to come back. I worked in Lawn and Garden and it was peaceful, learning about plants and making my customers feel welcomed. I tried to answer as many questions as I could when we were thrown out there with no knowledge. I learned almost everything in a few weeks, and was let go after the seasonal period. I liked it because it was fast paced and I was loved by all of my customers outside."
bad,"The pay was decent, but hours were bad. I was not allowed to clock out until everything was done even the stuff that I was not held responsible for. Customers were down right rude and management didn't do much but walk around."
bad,This company is hiring part time associates mainly. There is no real advancement worth pursuing. The new leadership roles are not effective. Seems as though the tides have switched from a people caring company to a profit/shareholder focused company.
bad,I work at this Lowes In Daphne Al  worst management ever ... The store is a mess from back to front employees don't know how to talk to customer ... Store Mangers are worst then part timers... This entire store needs to fired...
bad,This job is so terrible I developed a wart on my right foot and hemorrhoids. Basically they work everyone too hard and they don't admit it. I never want to go back there.
bad,"Lowe's is currently a very stressful environment. The company is going to open a new Bangalore, India office with an additional 1700 seats. It is evident from the culture in the office that many more positions in the Mooresville CSC will be eliminated and reassigned to the Bangalore CSC"
bad,Although I'm very gratefull for the experience I gained here. Its not a Company if your seeking development. Management is also extremely inefficient.
bad,"Awful, short-sighted leadership (worked with CEO and executive team known as L2s and L3s) with zero appreciation for diversity. Dominated by white males. Limited career advancement or professional development opportunities."
bad,"The work is interesting.  The pay is decent.  The management flies by the seat of its pants.  Long term workers can have a distinct attitude of superiority over new workers.  Co-workers can pawn their work off on you if you are new, too.  You receive good general training from HR when you start, but the actual training needed for the department can be very lacking, as in, they don't train you properly and just expect you to know it off the top of your head.  Poor management exists at all levels from the Department Managers to the Store Manager."
bad,"Working here makes people feel like they just rode in on the short bus. Customers treat you as if there's drool on your shirt and managers talk down to you. Asking a manager for help only gets you a lecture about how busy they are. ""You really can't appreciate all I do here"" Just a tearing down, not actually helping. There are several men who do absolutely nothing all day and take loads of breaks. Customer service people get the short end of the stick. No other registers open 5 or 6 calls all ringing and not getting the department people to take their calls. Department managers being impossible to find or so arrogant no one wants help from them."
bad,"I wish a union would come in here. Managment is freaking out over how well Home Depot is doing and is trampling all over us in the process. They want us working harder for less money. They've fired great coaches or all the good ones have left. I come home in tears at least once a week because how my coach speaks to me, when I speak with HR, my words are twisted and never does anyone see my side."
bad,great place to work they pay good give good benefits and they are never understaffed management is somewhat friendly but they don't keep a good eye on employees
bad,"The company cant seem to stick to core values no matter how much they try, as it's all about this quarter's stock performance.  Every Manager is waiting for ""their time"" as they never know how loyal the company will be towards them.  "
bad,I was hired as a seasonal worker but was lead to believe I had a chance of being hired in as full time . Not the case as I learned only 1 percent have even a slim chance of even coming back for another season.
bad,"Was fired for claims that the management when confronted about could not back up with proof they claimed to have, thus making it impossible to get unemployment. The company has good benefits and decent compensation but if you do click with the management or you suggest things that could possibly help the process, if it doesn't line up with the managements ideals then you're out. Spent 2 and a half years here. Hours were long and expectations were unrealistic in most cases."
bad,Sacrifice any semblance of a life be willing to be stressed out by multiple managers who don't communicate to each other oh and the custom of not receiving any incentives for the massive work requirements put on by the very Ill equipped managers who don't know how to work a schedule. I worked then and couldn't find a spotter or an reach operator or he'll a manager at times. Horrible place to work only bared through it cause I really needed a job but that soon stopped being enough.
bad,Terrible company to work for that really couldn't care less about you. Management is useless and have no idea what they are doing. Stay away from this failing company.
bad,Not a bad job the management is what makes it a not so nice atmosphere. You will learn a lot about the store daily. The hardest part about the job are the hours.
bad,"I was excited to work at this location at first. The way it was pitched to me, it would be fast paced and team oriented. So far, it has been me cast out into the wild to figure everything out for myself. There isn't very much direction with exactly what needs to be done. Also, at this location, it seems as if it's every man/woman for themself. I really didn't think it would be like this. The job itself isn't that bad, they've been somewhat understanding about health issues and whatnot."
bad,"Don't treat employees right, abuse the employees and very disorganized, I lot of employees left already. Because can't accept so much abuse is not a nice atmosphere to work for this company or at least the store that I work is a mess"
bad,"you get screamed at, and managers look the other way day in and day out. Most enjoyable part of my shifts were leaving for the day. They promote suck ups that look good, but really undermine others to get ahead. Waste of 3 years... I quit due to co-worker harassment that was never looked into and I was told to walk away from, but get my work done in the same space as my harasser....it was ridiculous."
bad,Management will take up for the customers and not the employees. It is a very structured atmosphere. The customer cares more about the customers than they do the employees.
bad,Worst place I ever worked.  You have to remind them when your raise us due.  It takes almost 8 months to get benefits.  You have to bring something for pot luck when the managers bring nothing.   If you ask them something you get walked out the door.
bad,it is a nice place to work but the systems our out dated and the set up is not the best for productivity and in my short time there I have seen it hard for people to progress in the store
bad,Working at Lowe's is usually fun and relaxing when everyone does their jobs. When everyone does what they're supposed to do it makes working there a whole lot easier.
bad,Cut the compensation and commission- no more salesmen. Lowe's belief system is in whoring out stock to their officials who then just sell it.  Great strategy!
bad,I was forced to quit after my auto accident due to their attendance policy. None of my absences were excused so It was either quit or be fired.
bad,"Very physical demanding employer. I find it to be a high stress employer.  I think people on death row should be made to do this job.  I'm all man but this a tough gig, mental and physical"
bad,Ok place to work .Lowe's is a good place for all hourly dmployees.If upper managment would focuse on customers instead of profit it would be great place
bad,The pay is good. The management is pushy. The job is stressful and emotionally taxing. The occurrence policy causes so many to be fired. Lowe's is a joke. You need a part time job this is good pay otherwise I wouldn't even bother applying. The turn over rate is ridiculous.
bad,"Not much good I can say about working at the Charlottesville location. Management is clueless, ASM's really do nothing but walk around looking for things to gripe with. HR is non existent unless management needs them involved with someone. Really not there at all for you once you are hired."
bad,"bad management makes it a hard place to work at. "
bad,"Where to start? Management sucks, ridiculous schedules(days off and hours). You will only get 1 weekend off a month and will work late very often. Favoritism. Benefits are not worth it. The deliveries for the day are not planned well. The only good thing about the job is meeting some of the customers, but then again some of the worse things about the job is meeting some customers as well. If you need a little bit of help with your family forget about it. All management worries about is the customer not you. If it's time for you to go home and a manager promises a customer a last minute delivery you will have to take it out. When you need a manager to stay late to solve a problem they won't. Also if you find yourself in a unsafe position at a customers house management will make you delivery anyway. For example I had a ton of tile going to a new construction home and it was raining. The yard was mud, no driveway. I called a manager and told them I can't make the delivery and the manager made me do it anyway. The result was getting the truck stuck in the mud. This company only takes never gives. Save your self stress and don't apply for this job unless you are in desperate need for a job."
bad,Unfortunately working with the company is not that bad... it's management that sucks! This company runs by favoritism...you have to be someones puppy in order to succeed! No FT position gets offered to you unless they like you! Little to No hours! üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ
bad,"Management at my store was obsessed with squeezing blood from a stone. We had only 70% the manpower of an average store our size and management refused to hire enough help to get by. When enough people weren't available, corners had to be cut to get through the day- you almost never get your breaks, there's never any help available for heavy lifts so expect to have to wrestle 150+ pound items on your own, and you can never find a manager around to provide an override code when you need one (which is constantly, since their archaic computer systems are older than I am and weren't very good when they were new.) The Easton store has been in a death spiral of understaffing since with everyone being so overworked, people burn out and quit. Then with every person who quits, the workload gets that much worse on those left behind in a self feeding cycle. There is no excuse for a $44 million a year store to be run like this."
bad,Extremely poor communication between managers. The poor communication between employees and management makes things extremely difficult.
bad,"Been there since the beginning from 2008 in windsor, no other jobs were around due to recession, and lucky for lowes there was recession because they would have lost most of the good workers alot sooner, now jobs are coming back to the the area, theyre starting to see a high turnover, anyway, upper management is useless, dm's are actually better and know more, management will stab you in the back in a heartbeat, nepotism is the biggest issue, unless you came over to lowes from the start from walmart or the grocery business you will be an outcast no matter how hard you work, they will tell you what you want to hear but never follow through, policies change on the fly without being informed, they lie about pay scale, so much more to list i can write a thesis on it. All in all dont work here its a dishonest and brutal company, they only care about profits/sales= thier bonuses, this job is really for students for the time they are in school, and for retirees or people who are about to retire, other than that if you are in your prime years dont waste your time with this bigot company"
bad,"Lot's of rhetoric about family and how they care about their employees, but ultimately they are more interested in the bottom line than your family time.  This isn't really an issue, except that they tout themselves as so family oriented and so caring about work/life balance.  They really fall short in this category."
bad,"Horrible Place to work, no advancements, everyone defends there own jobs and doesn't attempt to allow advancement, must apply for advanced jobs. Pay is minimal for starting wages. Demand is typical for employees to act like Managers as well as current job, but only to get paid as worker bees. NO TEAMWORK - supervisor don't care!!!"
bad,"A typical day consisted of serving tables, running food and dealing with other workers. You never got a break no matter how long you work. Management was very rude and not prepared for problems that might have come up with customers. Other co-workers were fun and there are some you do not want to be around."
bad,"I would rather not comment or rate this job. Please think twice before you apply management does not have your back, and you are expendable. I wish I would have never applied or worked for this company"
bad,"Liked working with fellow employees, enjoyed helping customers, most of management was good to work for. A few employees were able to get weekends off, but most are stuck working every single weekend. Many employees were written up for working less than one hour overtime during busy season, i myself was lectured twice for working 10 minutes of overtime. In the winter months my hours always got cut to 10 a week, as did some other employees. Theres alot of responsibility for the pay, even had an associates degree and was only paid 2 dollars an hour over minimum wage. Training was poor, was forced to run power equipment i had never run before. Not allowed to miiss much work, even with a doctors excuse and being on fmla, was written up for missing. Lumber and lawn and garden are the worst places to work for lifting, your often pushed too hard to lift too much in 90 degree temps."
bad,"I work for Lowes in McComb, Ms and I can agree with what a lot of ppl are saying. I thought I was just the Lowes I was working at but to see the same exact thing at other Lowes thats going on at mines is a same. They have a good pay but not good enough from all the drama u have to deal with. Its very messy and not professional and management is right along with all the drama."
bad,"I worked in the lumber area as a cashier. I dealt with mostly commerical customers and enjoyed them.The management left a lot to be desired,I think that there were entirely to many people in charge ."
bad,First few months were fun but it didn't take long to see the cracks. Money. That's all that's important to the managers and company. Very little respect for the ones who make the store work....the employee on the sales floor. Mentality in this particular store reminded me of middle school. It's not what you know or how hard you work but whose backside you're willing to kiss. Management has their favorites and the rest share the burden of picking up the chosen few's slack. All but a couple of the management team are worthless. This store needs a drastic management change. Until then their turn over will remain to be high and the employees that stick it out will be unhappy and that shows in their productivity. I know it's a big company and this is typical work environment but it shouldn't be. It hampers productivity when your workers feel like and get treated like garbage.
bad,"the main manager would let a customer curse you out and possibly spit in your face and it will be your fault he does not like to be cursed out himself and wishes everything to run like a dream even though that's exactly what hes being paid to do is to handle difficult customers but somehow its your fault do not recommend Oxnard lowes to anyone unless you want to be treated like a in all a piece of sh  *t by the main piece of s"
bad,Loews is not a job just for anyone. I understand that they need and what there people to be at work when asked. but if you are needed by your family for even a death or birth of a child for get it. they what you to have in righting that you had a death in the family or other family matter. they are not nice about this at all.
bad,"stocking experience, ok shift to work, not much advancement, pay was ok but raises not easy to get. I want to dance and jig and eat some banana pudding, yum"
bad,"low pay,"
bad,"Supporting all members of staff and students in the college"
bad,"If you like to work hard and sweat this is the place for you.  It is extremely hard to advance in your career, and management is really new and inexperienced. The regular team members make the place what it is."
bad,"Lowes as a company I thought was a professional company when I first started working with them in 2008.  I come to find out that they are the farthest from professional.  The management team looks to find reasons to write you up and terminate you.  I was out on a Dr. note when I was fired and not even notified until two months after the termination date.  They lie, they use you to train new people and then they terminate you so they can hire the cheaper labor"
bad,Business for home improvement went bad 7 years ago and now slowly coming back. They should get busier as house values go up.
bad,"I have a poor review of Lowes,unless you were part of a (click) you are treated poorly."
bad,Once a job I absolutely loved. Turned into a job I never wanted to go to...
bad,Its a great place to work if you like to work on your house and any other projects. Management doesn't work with personal life and if you attend church. It pays decent and above average for retail environment.
bad,Management suck. Show favoritism and you will get fired over some he say she say. I hate it
bad,"I worked there for 10 years. Transferring to another store is nearly impossible. They have done a lot of changing in the last 3 years. Made things a lot harder on the employees. Took away our commissions, monthly bonus and some of our employee discounts. They said it was to be able to lower the cost for customers. Funny thing I seen more prices go up in that time then ever. I had only a few managers that worked on getting their people adviced the others could have cared less. Oh, and heaven forbid you start having health issues cause they will try and get you to resign. Hiring system is a joke. They are trying to get all the folks that been their years to leave so they can bring in people that don't know what their doing. Pay is also a joke. I know of sales specialist that got paid more then their managers. Talk about degrading."
bad,"Customer loyalty is the biggest part of working for Lowe‚Äôs Corporate. We are expected to meet extremely high standards to take care of the customers and retain them.Order processing is a large part of the responsibilities within the Sales Support Administrator position.  The customer may be experiencing technical difficulties, so the actions needed to fulfill the customers‚Äô orders would be implemented. Troubleshooting Lowes.com to provide the customer with a seamless experience while using our online features."
bad,The IT part of the company is in a large transition.  Senior staff has change a lot over the past few years.  This translates to not much vision that stays.                                         .
bad,"this job is horrible, it has so much potential, but with the new policies and procedures and the company seems to be cutting back"
bad,If your not hired full time you would only get about 15 hours per week for part time
bad,"A day a typical day at Lowes involves 10-12 hours standing on your feet picking, moving and loading boxes of various sizes and weight. The operation of powered equipment to accomplish various jobs. I learned how to operate powered equipment, to pick product out of perm racks and to load trucks.I also learned that Lowe's care nothing for their employees. I work and got along well with my co-workers and was frequently sought out by them to answer question about jobs they were doing. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,"Management does not care for their employees. However, your coworkers will be there when work needs to get done. Great staff of people to work with."
bad,"Training on equipment like forklifts was good. Training on your job details poor at best. Coaches were mostly not very competent. Advancement available if you fit their profile. "
bad,"they lack people skills"
bad,"Although I've met many people I have become good friends with while working here and have gained some wonderful job experience I feel as if the company as a whole does not care about the wellbeing of their employees. Management and corporate executives work for a salary therefore are not bothered that 300+ people cannot afford to pay their bills on hourly pay when they only offer 10-15 hours a week after saying 30+ hours will be available upon hiring and require open availability,"
bad,Unfortunately my team I had to work with did not get a long so we were not as productive as we should have been. The management was not friendly and where not truthful as i feel they should have been and they job was causing major health issues
bad,Always having to change with the incoming management team (ASM'S and store manager) there is no consistence within lowes. If you don't fit in with the ASM's you will be sorry.
bad,"They messed over a lot of good people just to replace them with part timers and rob them of "
bad,"On a typical day you will either stay busy, or fight for work, one or the other. Team Members are on what is called an ""E2"" program. This program tracks where you are and what you are doing every day throughout your shift. You have the ability to make more than your base salary due to this program, but on slow days you also have the ability to lose all the extra money that you've earned due to working your rear off on a busy day. The base starting pay is low, but more than minimum wage. During the warm months, it's extremely hot, during the cold months, it's extremely cold. It's an extremely dirty and dangerous atmosphere. There are groups of Team Members who are unbelievably dishonest, and they enjoy attempting to gather personal information on other Team Members so that they may spread rumors. Writing adverse statements on one another is a big hit at this place. It happens all the time!! Management is extremely dishonest and bias. They will look you in the eyes and tell you one thing, then leave you to do the opposite. Management encourages Team Members to write false statements against one another, and will attempt to intimidate Team Members who are not on their ""favorites"" list. The hardest part of the job itself is to deal with the elements and lift heavy product. The most enjoyable part of the job is to punch the clock to go home at the end of your shift.  "
bad,"Some management, not all of the management, need to learn to work with the people who want to advance with the company. The ones succeeding in the company are the ones who are friends with management. Some of the management do not know how to take control over staff and have everyone work equal instead of having favorites. "
bad,"You will be disrespected and abused, lied on, terrible place to work"
bad,Low low pay. . Management is very unorganized..lots of drama
bad,"lowes used to be a great place to work. awsome people awsome customers and great management. over the last year lowes management has gone way downhill,"
bad,due to poor managment skills and favorits in the store not a fair work place at all
bad,"The management staff is a joke. They treat their employees like garbage. They keep around only the those employees who walk around the store all day. They call favortism ""mentoring"""
bad,"Hired as a CDL Driver for operating the Moffitt and Tandem Vehicle for commercial deliveries, I had the pleasure of working with some very nice helpful co-workers. Management at first seemed caring and enthusiastic but in a very short time came to understand they were false in their presentations. The hardest part of the job was like any other just trying to learn the everyday resposibillities and routine of day to day work. All aspects of the job were enjoyable after getting through the hurdles of confusion set forth by upper management."
bad,All Lowe's aren't this way. This one in Lubbock is horrible. Store runs on a skeleton crew. You deal with angry customers all day and are overloaded with tasks which can never be accomplished with the staffing issues they have.
bad,"If you like hard work, low pay and pitiful raises all while your managers are telling you that they started in the ""good ole"" days and that they are millionaires, this is the place for you!"
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company. The Management team does not talk to each other, therefor the employees are lost as to what is need to get the job completed."
bad,This company used to be a good company to work for but the new CEO changes are making it a terrible place for anyone with a family. You are only guaranteed 1 weekend off every 8 weeks. That's SIX WEEKENDS OFF PER YEAR!!!
bad,Managers are always impossible to find and overwhelmed. This effects their relationships with store level associates in several negative ways. I always anticipated some sort of panic. Managers hardly listen if at all. Company really has declined over the years. I don't believe Lowe's genuinely cares for their employees' well being.
bad,"People texting all the time "
bad,The WORST company I have ever worked for! Management is a joke. All they care about is the bs surveys and their precious bonuses that they never deserve because they don't ever help you do anything. All they're good for is nagging on you and nothing is ever good enough for them. Don't waste your time!
bad,I started in April of 2019 and I was not properly trained AT ALL !!! The back end manager fell short of her responsibilities 100% I had to reach out to other delivery coordinators in different Lowe‚Äôs locations  to see what I was supposed to do properly .. I was 100% set up to fail leaving me no choice but to quit ( walk out) after busting my butt to learn my job on my own .. store 52 needs proper management
bad,see above.  I have absolutely nothing more to say other than that.  Corporate isn't even trying to hide that they no longer care about their ground level employees.  Every employee in every store either needs to leave for greener pastures.  Or organize and unionize.
bad,"Learned a lot about receiving stocking and home improvement but with no room for improvement I do not see my self staying in the position, if a person is looking for a good part time job its the prefect place to work but with no advancement opportunities it is not the place for me."
bad,"Management quite literally is impossible to track down when needed. They refuse to train anybody (including people with far superior knowledge) on pickers/forklifts but complain that shelves aren‚Äôt stocked. Watched one of two of the only specialists in my department get canned for something trivial like a paperwork error- it‚Äôs very cult-ish as far as atmosphere goes. Some people drink the kool aid, some folks swim in it  very poor experience all around"
bad,"Extremely poor corporate and store management decisions have made Lowe's Companies LLC a poor place to work if you do work. The store I was with hired individuals off the street with absolutely no knowledge of Home Improvement or management skills. They advanced individuals into support management positions that miss work, spend more time in the break room, quit and then rehired them, let individuals stay in their current positions without fulfilling the job requirements listed in the job description. Lowe's is following the part time hiring trend in order to eliminate cost. 10 years ago Lowe's was a good company."
bad,They overwork the good employees and do not discilpine the non workers.  Expect to much and do not praise the hard work put in by thier employees.  A simple Good Job from management means a lot to some people.
bad,"It's a job that retires you not a job you retire from, if your thinking of being a delivery driver. But hey at least there health insurance is good. Cashiering is the same as any other place."
bad,Horrible place to work. Like every other retailer. Cutting jobs. Plans implemented then stopped a year later. I would not rec the them. Made good money but run by idiots.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and never work there. Not a well-managed system. The Store Manager and ASMs are terrible. They're arrogant, demeaning and don't listen to reason. The only way to get promoted is to suck-up, and they don't value experienced associates."
bad,One of THE worst jobs I've ever had!  Infested with bullies.. And if you are not apart of the clique they will prey on you every single day! Glad I left!
bad,As a headcashier there is alot of responsibly managers get upset when asked to help.  Over all i would say job is stressful and just wasn't for me at all .
bad,Not a good company to work for .To much favoritism .Not enough pay.Management not on same page as others.They are not customer friendly. Job ended without warning.
bad,Extremely short staffed for employees and customers. Most stores are not run by competent managers. The company has become very short sighted. There is a new CEO and not all the changes are in the best interest of consumers or employees.
bad,I was there for two years and they gave me a 50 cent raise but the people there are good people and other departments and nobody knows what to do they don't want to work and help you out there are few good people the manager store manager is an idiot
bad,Would never advise working here & have 1st hand experience into the working for many years and one day told you're fired as we have outsourced you....
bad,Management at my store was atrocious. Terrible communication and no accountability. Understaffed as well. The employees that ARE there are expected to do TOO much work to make up for the short staffing. No loyalty to employees.
bad,Hey have their favorites that get by with anything. Everyone else gets chewed out for doing some of the same things. Rotating shifts. Get off 9:30 pm and sometimes have to return at 7:00 am.
bad,"Working hours bad. Day night,  mid, close. No regular schedule. Hard on family daily functions. Have been there for almost 9 years, would like something different. Would like stability and comfort"
bad,"This job sucks "
bad,"I started at Lowe's for 9 years started as a part time associate  worked up to a specialist,  to much favoritism I was side stepped numerous times for promotions,  because I was too good at my job( flooring ) managers just bark orders they run and hide from customer complaints and have service managers do everything , there were two store closures within 50 miles of the store I worked at , got called in the back on a Saturday after the store manager had me deal with a bad install issue and said we got to let you go because of customer complaints really shame on you Lowe's"
bad,"The current management is not knowledgeable. They can't offer you any support and don't have any cross-training. This company has been working in increasingly unethical ways, especially after out-sourcing their HR Department. Avoid at all costs."
bad,The best part about the job was the regular customers that would always come to you each time because they received good customer service from you. The worse part was the managers were terrible and if you weren‚Äôt in there little favorites group then you couldn‚Äôt advance in the company. If that store had a entire management makeover it would be a great place to work.
bad,"This place used to be so amazing. The pay, the advancement opportunities, everything was great. Commissions were taken away, bonuses were taken away, department managers were all fired and the culture bled. I miss working here when I had first started but now it's a sad distant memory"
bad,"Lowe's has taken a sharp downturn in quality over the last decade. Most corporate decisions seem sczitophrentic and lack any real world knowledge about how the stores actually operate.  Management, however it happens to be structured that week makes or breaks a store. Unfortunately all of my experiences over a decade were with management hired from the outside (,little promotion from within) who couldn't keep it in their pants, and or were horribly vindictive in nature, which seems to be the type the company liked in those roles.  The family atmosphere was very nice, it just seemed more a family struggle most of the time."
bad,managers leaned on the employees who did more and the employees who did nothing kept their jobs but the people who busted their behinds got fired no follow through on things they would say
bad,In 2017 LOWE‚ÄôS laid off an entire division of account manager specialists across the country with no warning whatsoever. Not only was this disastrous to the long term employees and their families but also destroyed their contractor account base across the country.
bad,"If your nose isn't in someone rear, your not moving anywhere. Lasts years pay raises everyone got a 3%. Not fair if your meeting all your stats and doing really well you get the same raise percentage as lazy Susan."
bad,"Lowes pays fair wages, actually the money is decent. You do work a set schedule which is helpful for planning home life. However the work envionment its self is stressful and fast paced. The trainners are terrible and do not take the time to fully train the new hires. There is absoutley no consistency with the work or the environment. The management is incredibly unprofessional, and is unethical at best. the amount of favoritsim and politics is discusting. the truth is the ONLY good thing abut working for this company is the pay and and the set schedule."
bad,"I don't like to pilfer from someone else, but I read another review for this job that stated: ""I left to pursue something less stressful, such as crash-test dummy or rodeo clown,"" and that really sums it up beautifully."
bad,"i don't remember much about this company it has a lot of turn over"
bad,They are very unorganized and could use an engineering upgrade! The PANDA area is so redundant and the receiving lanes are marked poorly the entire warehouse needs a major upgrade. Slavery at its finest!
bad,"If the managers are a reflection of who the company says they are, then, I'd advise against considering employment there. Over all, the CSA are overworked and under appreciated."
bad,The coworkers are the best part of the job. They can't keep anyone here because of micro management and cutting hours dramastically. It makes the job really stressful and you are always looking over your shoulder because almost every manager has something to say about what your doing wrong or not enough of.
bad,I've worked for Lowe's 18 years and it has gotten worse as the years go by. Lowe's used to be pro  employee and cared about it's people. Now it's just pro customer at all cost to it's employees. Very rude cliental as well
bad,"Would not recommend this place to a lost dog looking for work. So many false promise's fake people fake expectations. To much work understaffed. Even their customers agree there awful people. These folks really do not appreciate good people your just a number to this large corporate entity. Please avoid them and just don't do it unless you're just desperate."
bad,"If you would like to deal with mangers that act like your scum of the earth, then by all means this job is for you. The management team does not communicate with anyone; then when you ask one question to them they are very rude. They treat employees that show up and do their job bad. They're so poorly staffed because of how they treat their employees. Most of their departments have a high turn over rate because everyone quits within 5 months of working there. The only people that actually stay are the full-time employees. If I were you I would just look elsewhere this place is awful and if I could give it zero stars I would."
bad,"Lowes often doesent have enough people to cover all of the departments. Most employees do not know all the ends and out of the departments, but are constantly asked questions they dont understand.Managers dont know the departments either. The compensation for the amount of work fequired (especially Lumber) do not match. $10.00/hr for a forklift operator moving Lumber. Lowes does not take care of its employees financially."
bad,"I have worked for lowes 4 different times. Every time has a different story, I have seen good  aND  bad managers more bad store managers than good. This last time I was very disappointed how I was treated."
bad,"Most days we are terribly understaffed to the point that we have one associate running three different departments. We run out of receipt paper and bags regularly. We constantly have angry customers due to long lines, hold times, and mistakes related to lack of coverage. Managers are not on the same page. Rules are not enforced. New associates are left on the floor alone without proper training. My particular location is an all-around disaster of a home improvement store. In general I enjoy my job, but it is extremely difficult to do your job when you aren't provided with the tools you need to succeed. "
bad,"i worked for this company for a long time, and as the years went on, managers became less and less knowledgeable and poor managers with poor communication skills. They became more about training the employees to fear getting fired instead of loving what they do for a living. Making sure the customers were happy is what Lowes used to instill in you, making the atmosphere a team atmosphere instead of everyone being out to get you. It is also extremely understaffed  and underpaid for the things they expect you to be able to do in an  8 hour day. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Would be an ok place to work if they would hire GOOD help...  The people they hire don't even want to work, the HR manager is just hiring for the sake of hiring...  How about hiring people that actually want to work!"
bad,Very unorganized management team. Customer service is a big focus and should be. A little behind compared to other companies. Inventory every day of the week.
bad,They don't care about the employees been with Lowes 10 years and you decide to terminate me because I was in Rehab.  Good luck to your employees.   Because your company sucks
bad,Lowe's is a company thats make policy changes every year. They make promises that they never keep. They hire managers that are lazy and wanted the associates to resolve all the issues. Management is super Shady. They don't acknowledge hard working people. They Praise Laziness
bad,"to much micro management and bad organization. One manager tells you to complete a task and another manager says forget that just do what I need you to do. I was told the last two days before my seasonal job ended that I was not trained or qualified not to operate electrical machinery, but I was trained and that was the job I did picking and pulling appliance wilt a forklift and order picker so that is fraud."
bad,Worst part of the job is without a doubt the management. Terrible people who are only out for themselves and more worried about their bonuses than they are employee fulfillment or advancement. More often than not when presented with a valid question or need for equipment to complete a job you are often blown off or over looked. Unqualified employees are allowed to remain in their positions despite the fact that they present a clear hazard to others around them
bad,"At lowes home improvement you were required to complete the most demoralizing tasks. Its 105 degrees outside and your required pants long sleeve, good luck fighting back, managers make way more then they should be to treat you like they do."
bad,"No training, trial by fire dropped in the lions den kind of introduction to new hires. deceitful tactics in selling products and installations. Despite knowing otherwise, employees are told to lie to customers by promising product lead times and installation dates that managers know full well cant be met. Instead management encourages sales specialists to lie to get the sale processed and once we charge them for the project they are at our mercy. next to impossible to cancel and its like pulling teeth to get your refund in a timely manner. A big part of the sales specialist position is being a punching bag for angry customers and getting constantly berated over the phone by unsatisfied customers."
bad,"not enough employees to take care of the customers and do all the packing down and stocking the shelves that is needed"
bad,"Delivery is very unorganized, can‚Äôt keep delivery drivers or managers; went though several drivers working here....decent pay but overworked, very insensitive to ppls needs"
bad,"When I first started working at Lowe's in 2014 it was a good company to work for and I was excited to work there. I saw that there was the opportunity to advance, and I did so. Then in December of 2016 the company restructured management and benefits greatly hurting the morale of many of it associates..."
bad,"I worked as the lumber/ pro services cashier. The management could careless about that end of the building they only came down if something went wrong. When the customers would complain daily about not having any help the management would blame us instead of finding help or a solution. After the restructure happend the management got worse, we never saw our store manager and if we had an issue they would pawn it off on the service and support managers instead of helping and getting involved. Overall it is a poor company to work for and I wouldn't recommend anyone working there at this point."
bad,"Due to restructuring of the management positions at Lowe's Home Improvement, job loyalty has not been valued. Tenure and experience are being replaced by lower paid employees."
bad,"At any given time throughout the day there will be 1 person to cover 2-3 depts for 2 or more hours.  The buying office has discontinued, or only orders minimum qtys of product needed.  & then they wonder why the competitor is busier."
bad,Lowes has decreased its staff by almost half and expects productivity to stay the same with no support to departments.  Serious lack of communication and accountability.
bad,Minimal work life balance. Stressful environment. Management doesn't back you up. Customers are given everything no matter if its right or wrong. You have to work every weekend.
bad,"management team treat people like animal,very rude,skin colour matter,overall company good,managment garbageüëéüèºi suggest if you looking for job,this is not the place to go,the treat very badly,hyper management overthere"
bad,"they don't care at all for the delivery department. they leave you outside at the end of the shift for 15-20 before they get the ""time"" to let you in. always over schedule to where you're working 12+ hours a day. they play the schedule to where they work you 9 days straight. they need help in the management department bad."
bad,"i learned in order to make real money i had to go back to school, it was a fun place to work in the summer but poor in the winter the manager would cut hours on purpose and start with the part timers it made it difficult to save for college."
bad,"We needed to be prepared to create a kitchen for anyone who approached our desk!  This was fun and challenging.  I learned to use the 20-20 design program from a co workier who trained me.  There was very little support from management regarding the position.  The front desk was not allowed to take messages for us from customers because then ""everyone will want that"".    The workplace culture was sort of a work camp environment.  Most people were trying to find a way to get out...  "
bad,At the time I worked at Lowe's the management was the problem.  I liked the people I worked with and the customers.  But the management was the worst I had been exposed to in my 25 years working.
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work at, The operations supervisor has poor customer service and is prejudice against certain employees. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Hated this company. While the pay was good, the management was awful. I could throw up on the job and they would just tell you to deal with it. Not flexible with schedules and will laugh at you for asking for certain days to be unavailable. Sexually harassed on a daily and management did nothing about it. Hostile employees were hired and kept on even after they had altercations with other employees."
bad,When I first started with the company it was a great place to work and the company cared about the associates. As the years went on and many changes were had the security of one's job was no longer there. They made drastic changes in the company's philosophy and many good employees were let go as to fine tune the port folio with Wall Street. I could no longer in good moral values recommend anyone to apply with them. I was let go after 16 years of service with no notice and I was the most tenured and one with knowledge .I along with 3000+ were let go with no notice at all.
bad,Fast paced day management dose not care about their employees  a lot of drama the only way to move up in the company is through brown nosing.
bad,Wonderful company to work for. The most pleasant part of my job was customer service end. I really enjoyed the day to day customers that really wanted to know about home improvement. Cooperate does a great job. However they have taken away from the associates over the last few years. Have found no ways to boost moral and don't seem interested. The upper management to me that are being placed into leadership roles are not good leaders at all.
bad,"Working with customers can be both fun and challenging.   You may have great experience or you may not.  Depends on ability of store manager to be fair and get to root cause of issues.  If you have the word manager in your title, you may be held accountable for things you have little control to change.  The environment is political.   If they like you, you can do no wrong.  Pay is above average for retail but you should prepare in advance for management turnover when things do not go well.  Used to be a great place to work but they have tried too many times to reinvent themselves with change rarely implemented or budgeted well.  With poor staffing, hiring and training over along period of time the last 2 years were difficult to endure.  There are stores that are well run but not in Greece NY."
bad,"Every year it gets harder and harder with less employees, more demanding customers and an out of touch market team. "
bad,"While working here there was little to no team work, managers always had an personality problem with team members and did not try to uplift employees to receive better results, and talked down to employees."
bad,"Would be a great place to work if Poughkeepsie location would have the right employees working there.. Horrible workers, unprofessional  and unqualified management. Constant call outs and don't come back for lunch, and excuses to go home early. The 3 months that I was there I have seen 20+ people leave due to the lack of professionalism in this place and mistreated of some employees its like working with a group of kindergartners.. All I can say is don't work in this loaction, you won't like it and end up leaving because of all of what I stated above...fair warning!!!!!"
bad,"After putting up with Lowes for 2 years as a Delivery Driver I finally got tired of the worst management ever,  They continue to change the schedules for there convenience.  They do not respect there employees.. Drivers do not last there because of management. Although I like the job management is really bad."
bad,"I worked for the ITSD in Wilkesboro and the pay was decent. However, everything else was horrible. There were so many changes in such short periods of time that none of us knew the applications we were supporting anymore. There were also no opportunities for training and when management was confronted with this issue they did not know how to handle it. Sterling is the worst application that caused so many issues with numerous customers (getting charged more than once, product never arriving at their house, etc), but upper management refused to get rid of it. Overall, I would say this is a decent start but leave as quickly as you can. The last two months I was there we had seven people besides myself leave. I have never worked anywhere else with such a high turnover rate. I would never work for this company again no matter how much they paid me. They don't care about their employees like they say they do. You will be just another warm body to support the stores or corporate employees."
bad,im not hopping on here to Be a hater But all these reviews are B.s The management is corrupted it's a dead-end position as far as customer service I worked there for a while I  hated every minute being in there if you decide to be employed by this company just know all that  glitter ain't gold .store 1624 is the worst !
bad,"Horrible work environment, supervisors all gossip and treat everyone horrible. No potential for growth unless management likes you, they don't base it off knowledge. horrible place full of lies. Worst call center experience ever"
bad,"management needs to improve. they have there good times and bad times. just some stores have problem / my job I loved and still do, just my asm"
bad,this place sucks!! they are always under staff and they treat you like your nothing!! they make you work overtime but want you to cut your hours back during the week.
bad,"This has got to be the most backwards company that I have ever worked for. I knew that I hated it when I worked for Home Depot. Unfortunately I could not stay there. Lowes only cares for a customer when they are trying to get their money. Once the transaction is complete and the customer is out the door, the care stops. The only care from the store management is if they get their bonus or not."
bad,there was to many politics going on and gossip between workers and rumors started about people who were not liked some of the cashiers were stealing money all in all it was a bad place to work when I was there im glad I got out when I did.
bad,I would not recommend working for Lowe's.  They are not concerned with your work life balance.  The most important thing to management is Lowe's.  Every store that I communicate with in my district are short staffed.  Very poor morale.  High turnover compared to other jobs at this pay.
bad,Run from this place. They don't want you to have a life. No breaks if you are in the trucks. No time for home
bad,This company and its culture of scrapping by to cover sales and payroll is counter productive. Senior staff at this location was very inexperienced. High store manager and asm turnover. Work ed at 3 stores prior to working here and started in 2006. This store and company does absolutely nothing to retain it's top talent. Will not promote from within. Poor working conditions and environment.
bad,Liked learning about new products. Most co-workers were great . Management changed to much to form a opinion .The hardest thing was to deal with a upset customer. Knowing that your helped a customer get what they needed.
bad,a typical day at work - busy
bad,"The new store manager is totally clueless at how to manage 140+ people. Draconian rules are now being enforced, smoking a cigarette on your 15 minute break can get you fired. You are not allowed to have a bottle of water in an inconspicuous spot on the sales floor. You have to walk to the back of the store in order to just get a drink of water. Speaking of water, at least the roof is fixed and no longer gushing water into the aisles and on product."
bad,I left another big box store to work at Lowe's close to my home supposedly for more hours as well. Part time was described to me as 25-30 hours. I got 10 and sometimes 15 hours. What adult can get by on 10 hours? The people who started before me were getting 25 hours. Lots of excuses ... not many hours.
bad,"I was made aware that a person that I did not get along with and had no respect for me was going to become by direct manager. I told the hiring manager of that person that I did not feel comfortable working with that individual especially if they were going to be my boss. I was told that they would not hire that person because they did not want to lose me as an employee. They hired that person anyway after they FAILED the background check. Around a month after that person was done getting trained, they started causing drama and making snide comments toward me. When I reported them I was told that since I reported it that  I am obviously the problem. "
bad,"The management at Lowe‚Äôs is run by a bunch of doofuses and the the decision making is chaotic. When customers come to Lowe‚Äôs they find nobody in the plumbing, appliances, flooring or paint departments so the call buttons go off constantly!! Then customers make a bee line to the exit! "
bad,"To political correct company  will fire üî• you even though you are doing a good job    Now Human Resources  you talking to the ‚ÄúCLOUD ‚Äú  not a person   Management has no option but to fire you because the ‚ÄúCLOUD‚Äù said to do it  I put 6 years in  with great worth ethic  but the CLOUD came and everything chanced"
bad,"A member of management refused to work with me or answer my questions while training me. And eventually when I needed their help to grab something for my daily duties they grabbed it and threw them at me, hard. I went to HR and nothing changed."
bad,"Obvious favouritism, they make ""building policies"" they work in favor of lowes not the team members. Management will say one thing and do another. Will not work with you on a schedule. Awful hours. Mandatory overtime. Negative cliques. Repetitive work, and especially dont get injured on the job they will tell you to kick rocks, or get pregnant."
bad,"I have worked for Lowes twice now.  They are totally awful to work for.  Half the management team is wonderful, the other half including upper management are awful.  No respect for people that actually do work.  I had one boss that was an operations manager that spent her entire day shopping on Target.com and for handbags.  Seriously."
bad,"Worked Pro Services , and wanted to transfer to store 6 mins from house, instead of 55 mins . Was averaging $30,000-$50,0000 per month in sales "
bad,"Lots of favoritism , always short staffed, good benefits though , customers can be rude but it‚Äôs more so the employees and policies changing so frequently that made me dislike the company ."
bad,Didn‚Äôt feel comfortable and management is really poor and pay is poor not the best place to work and just rude customer and rude employees literally don‚Äôt work here
bad,When you interview someone for a spot and pay then you need to put them in the n that spot at that pay. When I find another job I will not work for Lowe's again.
bad,"Employees are the best but management sucks, don‚Äôt communicate with their employees well and they cut hours at least 5 times a year especially when they have hiring events"
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs will literally hire anybody as long they can pass a drug test. Doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with past experience, or work ethic. They are just desperate for people. The management at Lowe‚Äôs is a joke. You‚Äôd think the managers should have some idea as to what they are doing but they don‚Äôt. There is only about 10 hardworking people throughout the store, and the good ones are the only ones who do any of the work."
bad,"The management there doesn't do anything. They had no idea what my job description was or what I was to do, Noir how to do their job. There is absolutely zero training, you're left to figure it out on your own. And good luck with the 1970s system they use. The pay is great but management really does not care care"
bad,People are out to fire and lay you off. The salary keeps the door revolving but what's the point of wasting all that money to train new people all the time. Not to mention the lives that get ruined or set back with having to find a new job at any point in what you thought was an amazing career opportunity.
bad,"Was hired as a cashier but transferred to the internet department a few months after starting. Loved working that position and got to roam the store and help other departments when i didn't have orders. However, i came in one day and was told that i would no longer be working that position all week, and would be doing cashiering on the week days and the internet position on the weekends, and a couple months after that i came in and was told that my position as well as many others were now gone, and while i wasn't let go they moved me to cashiering fully, which i did not like and was vocal about not liking. The store manager was nice and a couple of the managers were fun to work with, but there was an over all major problem with the managers communicating things to each other and others."
bad,"Not college-friendly"
bad,"While it is the nature of business to want to turn a profit, Lowe's is going the route of everyone before them.  Cutting anyone who knows anything or is paid above $12 an hour.  Like so many, they are hiring former Walmart management, who's time had came and gone with that company, only to put the same ""proven to fail"" processes in.   And step on anyone in their way to make their bonuses, with a failing store around them."
bad,"ASKING too much for less money and requiring more with less resources. They like to remove things that work and make things harder by changing rules nearly every week.  You have goals to work toward monthly in certain positions which are mostly unrealistic. And they PUSH credit on customers knowing how credit has destroyed people. The dollar... its really all they care about. Expectations are high, training is low and you are expected to perform anyway. The place sucks. I would rather work for less money and prevent the unending stress that will surely come instead of working for them. PERIOD!!!"
bad,"Getting hired was easy. Very easy. They hired me as seasonal. It is a 6 month period, but based on August (So you could potentially only work there for a month if you applied in the beginning of July). That's the agreement. No harm, no foul. Lowe's is going through some problems though. They do not want to compensate people. That's really what it comes down to. The use a computer to make the schedule (yes, I know it's a big company). However, the computer doesn't understand that shifts like 1-5, 3-8, and 10-2 are a little strange compared to their standard 9 hour shift with an unpaid hour lunch. Like I said, they don't want to compensate people. They also don't care about your learning experience. You can literally screw up like 15 times and they won't even blink. If you want to work in a compensatory environment that respects the experience of its employees and fosters a cultural spirit of actually giving darn don't work at Lowe's."
bad,"The coworker you will work with are and will help you to the very end, the management is terrible. They are very political, Hippocrates, and most of the time lazy. They will praise you doing a good job during a busy day and then the next day they'll complaint on why you didn't do a certain task I'm on that day"
bad,"all management cared about was making the numbers for bonus on the backs of there workers, when busy sending employees home and saving on payroll at the cost of the employees"
bad,"I normally don't do reviews, but this is serious! My main duties included drug screenings, pushing candidates through for hire, screening applicants for interviews, setting up interviews, processing I9's, checking background checks, scheduling and conducting orientation and onboarding, time keeping, scheduling, and attendance. Make sure drivers and associates are compliant. Now that a new transition has happened which went into effect July 1, 2019, all the ASA's job description has been changed. We are no longer in a office. We have to work in the training room with all confidential information exposed, which will lead to a HIPPA investigation. We no longer have keys to the filing cabinets or office, yet we still have to handle confidential documents and have no where to put them during the day. We no longer terminate or transfer associates, help with position postings, conduct orientation (which the new hire will access the digital New Employee Orientation presentation on the training computers) while we input their I9 info into the system. We no longer have access to over half of what we use to. Every task that was been taken has now been placed on the TA's, ASM's, and SM's, as if they don't already have enough to do with little time we have in a day. If an associate has an issue or concern, they have to email or call HR about it! They have just started using self scheduler for candidates to schedule their own interviews. That was my job. This company think they are doing big by welcoming all this new technology when all they are doing is ruining people's lives by taking their"
bad,"Some of the people were great, but others are always in drama and getting into situations that shouldn't be in a workplace, especially since it's all adults. Some of the managers were unprofessional and horrible to staff. Wouldn't recommend if you need a good job, but if you need ten hours a week and is a shut in, except with customers, highly recommend."
bad,There is no communication. The store manager does nothing about taking care of problems there even after being told about them. He has a supervisor there that breaks rules and the manager just overlooks them he has been told about them numerous times
bad,"Hated it bad place to work the managers were lazy as ever not wanting to do any work"
bad,"They do not care for huge personal problems, the place cares too much about themselves and not the customer or employees. The work environment targets too many people with disabilities, wrong questions are asked with certain disrespect for service dogs."
bad,"I‚Äôve been working here for quite a while and have gotten no advancement. I apply only to positions where I feel I will do well. They don‚Äôt want that. If you don‚Äôt want to go where they want you, they will continue to ignore your applications. Currently this company is comping more than 20-30% each week. Bringing in millions of dollars a month, yet hours are being cut. They are also on a hiring freeze. We don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve been here a while and am the lowest paid associate in my dept. the new hires get more then the folks that have been there a while. I roll with the tide though. When they need me to work 40 hours because they don‚Äôt have enough people, I do it. When they cut me down to 8-12 hours a week I deal with it. They don‚Äôt appreciate it. You are cattle here. They are constantly looking for ways to cut cost and maximize their bottom line. I guess that happens a lot here with these type of companies. I voice these issues with the annual employee survey but see nothing done about it. The management is shady and does things the way it shouldn‚Äôt be done. I‚Äôm surprised no one has blown the whistle because they could or should be getting into serious trouble. It‚Äôs all about if they like you or not or if you‚Äôre a pretty girl. Otherwise you‚Äôre out of the club. Very corrupt. It didn‚Äôt used to be like this in the beginning. Since then though we have had 2 manager replacements and multiple assistant manager replacements. It‚Äôs an awful place to work. The pay is not worth the stress. Stay away from the Turlock CA Lowes"
bad,Before I left I was told that the our location ( Morse crossing) was the 3rd worst location for customer service and it is rightfully deserved. I had only been there since last August and their customer service is really bad. They make people wait 20 minutes or longer to get items loaded in their cars. Management walks right past customers if they need help to look for someone else. They refuse to answer their phones when you call for help and even hang up on you without an explanation or they refuse to come up when their is a negative issue with customers. The managers don't listen to their employees so they walk around frustrated all the time which affects their customer service. As a support supervisor I asked my manager how to deal with employees being frustrated and believing their was favoritism and he informed me to let what they say go through one ear and out the other. They allowed other support supervisors to continuously bad mouth the company to new hires. Cashiers who have been really rude to customers have been allowed to keep working there and probably promoted since I left. When approaching managers about the shortage of employees because of management not scheduling enough we were told I don't want to hear it you figure out. They never give you any positive constructive feedback regarding your performance. They only tell you that you need to improve that your performance is poor. One customer waited 45 minutes on the phone for management to tell them if a $3.00 clearance item was in stock!  Management raised their voices at employees. Says sarcastic things to
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's, the customers don't care about you or your feeling. Management don't care about you or your feeling. Coworkers if you‚Äôre not in their pollical group, sexual preference group, religion group or your social status they don't care about you or your feeling. No christen holidays greetings, party‚Äôs because it may cause discrepancy. And every day you have Management vs workers, unless you are in good with the manager. Manager thank they are all that and a bag of chip, NOT!"
bad,"I was a server before this job and that wasn't even as stressful as the front end at Lowe's was. The management at my location was HORRIBLE and there's absolutely no communication whatsoever. They would not let you have a fixed schedule, so be prepared to work every weekend. The pay was decent, but since you can't have any overtime in the front end it just isn't enough and they take so much out in taxes and for the benefits if you are able to get any."
bad,This company is always short handed. They don't care who's feelings they hurt. If you have a complaint about managment you are snow balled from there.
bad,"Constant battle with the computers and IT structure as it is beyond antiquated.  There is no work/life balance, and its getting worse with the new schedules.  Never enough staff and managers do not really know how to do anything other then blame others for their short comings."
bad,was a great place to work but current management has destroyed the great culture. they claim safety is number 1 priority but the facility has a poor safety rating. we used to get performance bonuses but they made it nearly impossible to achieve these bonuses any more and they threaten our jobs if we aren't performing up to their standards.
bad,"Lowes Managers play favorites.  They would pick their friends, buddies for jobs that people had no experience. When you aske them why you were over looked because you have x amount of experience, they say, ""its my store and I can do what I want"".  I honestly have never seen employees  that had no moral as bad as this company."
bad,"Be careful with this company, management is clearly not educated on how to speak to employees, they have no professionalism, have no problem with talking down to you in front of customers. When confronted they give you a song and dance about how ‚ÄúThis behavior is not tolerated‚Äù however they tell you what you want to hear just to shut you up. To many cliques reminds me of high school if one person has a problem with you they all gang up on you. Wow, this is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. "
bad,I love the people who work there don't get me wrong but the company like to let go people a lot so don't get comfortable. Great people but poor management because corporate changes so often.
bad,"head cashier was a good job, but management is very poor. "
bad,"I needed consistent hours weekly, and it was NEVER consistent.  One week I would have 8 hours, then the next 15.  I was told I would get 25 to 35 hours weekly, but that never happened.  I couldn't live like that, so I had to quit.  I LOVED my Lowes job, so it was very hard to have to walk away from it."
bad,"I am looking to leave this job after only 3.5 months of working there. I have never worked for such a poorly managed business. Lack of communication, lack of training, out dated equipment ie, delivery trucks. In the short time I have been there I have had 6 different rental trucks and a rental Moffett as the Lowes trucks and Moffett are more than 11 years old and break down constantly. We go days without a truck sometimes because they break down so often. When we do get a rental they bury us with deliveries trying to catch up. This cause's a lot of stress and makes for very long days. They pay pretty well but its not worth it."
bad,"I was at this company for two years, in which they restructured twice. They got rid of 75% of their employees who had any experience. They tried replacing said employees with part time college students, but management continued to treat them poorly so turnover was even higher. They are currently under a new CEO, however he is still very new to his position and there is not much to see from him. Hardest part of the job was dealing with 3 managers each telling you to do something different. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and actually making a difference."
bad,"Management is a complete sh*tshow."
bad,Management says safety is a top priority but their main focus is on productivity. The place is very 2 faced. Their standards are done by engineers but are rarely achievable.  They are constantly writing workers up and getting off a write up is nearly impossible.
bad,Does not take care of the employees they don't recognize real talent and all upper management stab you in the back they have    arms that single you out
bad,Roughly 2 minutes late 6 times in 12 months. Didn't get promotion due to attendance issues and the manager is failing the job. Pay isn't fair to work load. Deals with entire fulfillment to barely make more then minimum wage.
bad,"Working at lowes was nice for awhile then reality sunk in and I saw it for what it was. Disorganized and lack of structure leading to unorganized work days. Some days we had too many cashiers, others we were struggling for coverage. The manager of the store seemed very rude and didnt seem to care much for anyone"
bad,"When i started working in the Corp.ProDivision in 2015 it was a great place with wonderful management & goals. Since 01/2017 its neither, rhe company has made a series of bad decisions ones i am sure they will feel the effects of for years;"
bad,"my typical day at lowe's is working in tools selling them to customers, answering phones. using powered equipment to get thing down. the most enjoyable part are my co workers."
bad,I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy.  They hire you part-time and work you almost 40 hours so they don't have to pay you any benefits   People are always calling off and they don't call anyone in to help it  makes for a very stressful work environment
bad,I didn't like working for lowes they did not allow any over time and if you got close to 39 hr. they sent you home no matter what department you worked in
bad,"My time at Lowe's will not be forgotten, and not positively either. The management were lazy, and would not help out when needed to. Managers would quite frequently ignore their job and hand it off to someone else. There was a certain time when I was alone in Lumber as a cashier and someone needed pro-services and I was unfamiliar with the process they needed to have done. I called the pro-services manager and asked for help since I did not know what I was doing, then she replied.""You can do it."" . This caused a job that would have taken 5 minutes by someone familiar with the programs and setting up deliveries into a 30 minute ordeal. This caused numerous stress for me and dissatisfaction from the customer."
bad,"When I first started my job, I loved it. The people were wonderful and I really thought I could move up fast if I worked hard. In reality I ended up helping train people who are above me that got hired after I did, I trained someone who ended up over me that had never worked for Lowe's and had never even ran a register before. It's very frustrating to be told they hire within when clearly they did not,"
bad,"Lowe's is solely in it for themselves.  They claim they will take feedback seriously and that they value their clients, but this is untrue.  They are not willing to allow their associates to do their jobs effectively because of all the red tape that they put in the way.  They also hold their sub-contractors first and do not value their own employees above them."
bad,You are just a number a star today fired tomorrow. They will look for a safety issues or attendance even if you have the time to use and all vacation is accrued over the year.
bad,"The Store Manager was awful!  He had zero people skills.  If he didn't like you, he made your life miserable.  He had lot's of complaints due to his behavior."
bad,Lowe's as a company is great but management is not as they will stunt your growth as a professional and will not allow you to advance no matter how hard you work. They push a culture of demoralization.
bad,"i worked on the nite stock crew .. I was good, didn't have to deal with customers or managers just the other people on the crew started when the store closed and ended at 6 am"
bad,Management does not care about their employees. A few of my assistant managers seemed to care until they could actually help with something. nearly impossible to even get hold of them throughout the day especially if you work at customer service because they dint want to fix problems and would ignore your calls.
bad,Management only thinks employees are a warm body I was with lowes many years then they terminated me along with several others that had over 10 years in lowes all the knowledge down the drain now when you go in a store no knowledge no help
bad,"Management promised to keep me on after the season was over. HR department let me go with no notice. "
bad,"As a cashier, you never get to leave your register. NEVER. Even if you have to go to the bathroom, you sometimes don't get to go because there is never enough people to cover while you go. They never schedule enough people in any department. You have to be comfortable with random customers yelling at you for what other people did or didn't do. At customer service, you basically run around crazy doing several tasks at the same time while customers assume you are doing nothing and complain you are not helping them. My main reason for leaving Lowes was they did not comply with my school schedule. As a part-time worker they were scheduling as full-time hours without my permission, then got mad when I would call in and tell them I could not work all of those hours because of school. Management does not care about the people that work for them. They only care about the numbers (total sales of the store, how many credit card applications were filled out, how many protection plans sold, etc.). However, all of the coworkers that I had there were great and I wish I could still work with them."
bad,I would not recommend lowes for employment. They seem to only be worried about shareholders and profits. I had 5 different managers in the short while I worked there.
bad,"With in the crew that I work with which is delivery, all the work that we do is difficult. The company/management fails to recognize the hard work we do and goes well passed un-noticed."
bad,"If you're a CSA or a cashier, the ASM and Service managers will treat you poorly.  The pay may be good but they could careless about you. Store manager is terrible, all managers are young and think they can run you. If you're looking for a stress free fun environment, do not work here. They do not train you and will just throw you in a department."
bad,Not the company from years ago greed and poor management has created an atmosphere where employee not the valuable asset. Working conditions have became unproductive.
bad,"In the last two years it has become unbearable to work at Lowes. Little to no help in all departments. Customer service is almost non existent. Not enough cashiers scheduled making for very upset customers. Managers just say ""make it work"". this is impossible as there are no employees in store to ""make it work"". Very discouraging work environment."
bad,"If you buy an appliance they push that free delivery ,and they don't care how many you have at anytime, so you may have 10 to 15 in a day on average 7 to 10 DELIVERIES your looking at 8 to 10 pm getting off and start time is get this( 5:45) in the am no good there. They think 14 bucks an hour is good enough, we would rather have a normal working day . That being said it keeps employees at each others throat. If management sees this think about what I am saying if you want to improve delivery! good night and good bye forever !!!"
bad,Always working in a consistently understaffed retail store. Rarely able to complete daily tasks due to lack of help. Helping customers with their home improvement projects is the most satisfying part of this job
bad,"Lowes used to be a great place to work, but they decided to alter their entire management staff. Which offset the entire store, and in my opinion disrupted the entire moral for all employees. Not only does lowes not care about their employees they dont really care what happens to their long term employees. In my time there i witnessed their top salesman, several 10+ yrs employees leave the company and lowes did nothing to try and keep them. If they dont care about their loyal employees then regular employees must mean nothing to them and I can't work for an employer like that."
bad,"Extremely short staffed with no immediate signs of change. Decisions made by corporate indicates lack of leadership or any intelligence. Specifically at my my store the people are wonderful and management tries hard. However, as previously stated, decisions and methods put out by corporate Lowes creates severe doubt about the success of the company."
bad,"Offers good benefits and competitive pay but fails to appreciate the performance of employees effectively"
bad,not a great place to work pay was nice but no life out side of work. and safety was not a big concern to them. trucks were damaged and never being fixed
bad,Work was decent just very poor management. Worked well with school schedule and hours were good. Poor management and no security. Management is very unorganized.
bad,If your not a manager you have no voice or value. You will never be appreciated unless you are top performer on the sales floor. There is rotating work schedule that constantly changes without you consent. Work life balance is dictated by the needs of lowes
bad,"I worked here for almost a year and management and morale is terrible in this Fargo location. There's only one person in HR and she should have never been given this job. Some employees are treated so poorly by management and HR, they're forced to quit. I would not recommend working here, especially after the company cut out those management jobs instead of improving them."
bad,"Management will push you to do certain task, but you will have 8 bosses pushing you in 8 directions. Plus customers that have been trained by cashiers and managers that the bigger drama they cause the more free stuff they get. Honestly customers have returned home depot products which we can't sell for ""customer satisfaction"" which just is a fancy way of saying they don't like dealing with customers."
bad,"Not the best place to work for, especially if you are latin/spanich."
bad,"Lowe's is a building filled with AWESOME associates. The business is run off ""Business Models"" which makes each position ""cookie cutter"". They want everything to be the same and DO NOT allow any flexibility."
bad,"Recent (2017) changes have completely trashed the culture at Lowe's. Corporate cut management staff in the stores which has resulted in horrible customer service and extreme stress for those who were left to pick up the pieces. "
bad,"If you like working like a normal human being, Showing up doing your job,working in a team environment.   This isnt the place for you  . Management  is is a joke  . Their system is a joke.  they  say part time but your basically working full time.   Everything is your fault  .  Your not part of lowes team unless your in the front of the house  . Theres a couple ""managers"" that act  like they're 17 year olds. Very unprofessional.   Your not appreciated ."
bad,"Lowes is a great place to work If you want to continue to learn. It has great benefits for part time workers. "
bad,"Favoritism is the key to make it at this store!  "
bad,It was a wonderful until management changed and people became bias and power absorbed. Bias individuals and not being able to move up within the company put a huge damper on my experience.
bad,"Not a nice place to work, no room for advancement and corporate's answer to pleasing the shareholders is to fire people that have been there the longest - mostly by a phone call. Do not think about a career here unless there is nothing else you can do."
bad,"I loved my co-workers, they were like family. I enjoyed my management position and the interaction with co-workers as well as customers on a daily bases. I enjoyed being able to solve customer and employee problems and make their day better. I did not however enjoy going behind others that continued to ignore the correct process and do things their own way. This caused me more work that could have easily been avoided. I was always available for the employees and I feel that I provided a good balance between manager and co-worker."
bad,"I workded at the sandy utah store and it was terrible. I was so excited and they destroyed my enthusiasm. They had no problem asking you for favors and working overtime to help them but, when it was your time to ask for help on your schedule or help in general no help to be found. I could go on and on how terrible the store was runned but why you get the drift."
bad,Had 9 years experience and was offered $10 dollars to work there which was a insult of my intelligence because some cashier's started off with more than that. Which means the management doesn't value good worker's.
bad,"Hot head management, threatens you if you attempt to go over their heads, and when you do you get fired"
bad,"I have over 25 plus years retail mangement experience. Work for 2 years had to train myself, which before red vest ready program, was ask my store manager to train the flex team do to all i have learned on my own received 8 customer service focus awards in a year, but cant even get a full time position or a interview 22 times applied"
bad,lowes is a nice start up job for any college or high school person looking for a first job but it lacks in hours and in pay advancement
bad,"Being a loader you're forced to push carts outside in whatever weather conditions may come even if it's raining, humid hot temperatures of up to 102 degrees, snow, and sleet. Management doesn't care, and you are outside most of the day. You are responsible for carts, emptying all the trash, refilling primo waters, and of course helping customers load their heavy products but no you aren't allowed to accept tips. Lowes policy. Do I do it anyway? Yes. Terrible position to get into."
bad,"You will notice there are always job postings at Lowes.  Very high turnover because the way you are treated.  Great benefits / wage and that is about it.  Lowes pays you well and treats you very poorly.  Management will talk to you like you're a 5-year-old.  You will be harassed, teased, and belittled by other employees and management.  Not enough employees to take care of the daily business or the customers.  Always pushing more work with fewer employees.  Mistakes are made daily and everyone plays the blame game.  On the surface, everyone seems happy, but in reality most employees are miserable.  You will be treated like a second class citizen and spoken down to very often by salary management.  The customers are terrible and always demanding something for nothing.  Absolutely the worst job I have ever held.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company."
bad,"Dealing with customers and complaints, relaxed dress code, co-workers for the most part were nice.  Hardest part was not having a set work schedule, management varied with some many departments"
bad,"Lowe's was a great company to work for, with the exception of inexperienced managers conducting with a ""tug-o-war"" effect."
bad,For 2 1/2 years I've been forthright in performing as an exemplary employee. I help in all services and all departments.  I'm still at $10 and change.  This pathetic company refuses to take care of hard working people.  I've approached management. They told me to look for work elsewhere.  All fellow employees constantly complain.
bad,"enjoyed working outside, however some of my fellow employees didn't know what it meant to be a team player..the managers also aren't there for the employees "
bad,"I worked registers, customer service and returns anywhere from 4-9 hours five days a week. I learned how to perform tasks quickly under pressure, and I had a mostly enjoyable experience with my fellow co-workers. However, the management was highly inadequate, often leaving under-experienced cashiers running entire sections by themselves during the busiest hours of the day. Because of this, there were often backed-up registers and unhappy customers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to run registers without much training or guidance. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers, because the majority were highly friendly and always had a smile directed your way."
bad,"Ive worked at Lowes for many years now. They just throw you out on the floor with no experience and expect you to figure it out. The managers dont care about you at all! all they care about is making sales so they can bonus. customers are rude, especially when you are a girl. they think you dont know anything. when in all actuality you know more then they do. they schedule you 2-11pm then 5:30am the next day. they make you work 10 days in a row, no overtime. its a living nightmare!!! Dont do it!"
bad,Management forgot about me and never returned my phone calls. Then got let go for not showing up? Bad experience. Feel very betrayed.
bad,"Lower volume store. Understaffed. Management frequently doesn't follow corporate policies and encourages employees to do the same. Store 1545 is referred to as the ""Ghetto Store"" because of its location and the event's that occur there. At times it can be dangerous. This store does have a experienced staff and many are good people. This store can be ideal for someone trying to gain experience in a particular field. Unfortunately, most hires are part-time and you can work 10 years there without getting full-time. When hiring for full-time positions those that have college degrees or significant experience in the position they are seeking are likely to get job. Recommend using this store as a launch point to enter another store; unfortunately, you must wait 6 months to transfer to another store once you been hired."
bad,"this review is coming from someone who was unexpectedly laid off today. And I will explain to you my experience at Lowes. When I first started I was pretty excited about it, I had good hours, I learned alot in the customer service field, and just was looking forward to move up in the company. When I started, my department had about 18 people and now there are about 7 or 8. During the 3 months multiple people quit, some were unexpectedly moved to another department then quit, but none were fired or ""laid off"". I originaly had 40 hrs a week, then about a month ago they took me and most other people down to 20 hrs a week (keep in mind i was hired for a full time position). So since everyone was getting less hours and there are less people, a job like closing the whole department that used to take 4 or 5 people now has to be done by 1 or 2. Each person only ended up working 5 hours a day, because if you worked 6 then that means you would have to take a lunch or a break. Like i said i was there for 3 months and had to close a whole department by myself a few times.And over those 3 months i had 4 or 5 customers call into the store and speak to the manager about how good of an employee i am, i worked very hard. Well I was scheduled to work today, i go in and see who was working with me and noticed that all of my days said ""Off"" for this week along with another person who was told he was laid off. The only difference is no one told me anything, i asked 2 managers and walked around the store for about an hour looking for the one i was supposed to talk to before i just left. In conclusion,"
bad,"The wrong people get promoted here. High stress environment. If your good looking you get two promotions to upper management and you don't even have to know what anyone's job is or how to do anything. Favoritism. Lack of attention to detail by managements ASM's. Employees unrewarded. If you like a job where you don't get trained, constantly get yelled at for not doing things you are never told to do in the first place work here. Management has poor communication to employees. constantly put downs employees by a poor female asm.Young slackers dream job as slackers get A1 treatment.Part timers hours cut constantly!!"
bad,"My management team are not present and involved in my everyday duties. They dwell in the offices way too much throughout the day. Location #1904 needs a good hard examination (annonymously to start with) so that the normal practice can be observed. The management team are cold, distant, condescending, and dishonest. They play favorites to some and chastise most others."
bad,"My title was Unload. Okay place to work at but the management at least in my location is terrible. The communication is poor, favoritism, unprofessional. Our store manager will go on vacation with another for however long and the store end up being a mess. Our Store manager Is completely ignorant of the problems other departments have and refuses to check on those departments. down the blame to other employees because of her own incompetence.The management will make us do task my team is not experienced in and will get yelled at if we do it wrong. Despite the ongoing problems of the store the district never does anything about it. She always passes. Our supervisor is immature and bragged about beating up a member of my unload team. Its gotten so bad that our entire unload team has left."
bad,I left my position at Lowe's due to payment problems with the company and management not exactly being in order. They had held back payments which had put me in an extremely unnecessary positions.
bad,"Lowe's was okay when I started, then the CEO changed and things got worse, good people got dropped without warning, small stupid decisions that, while I'm sure lead to a ""Grand Design"", hurts the associates more than helps them."
bad,If you are part time they can schedule you anywhere between 0 hours to 20 per week. The schedule is not steady. The company constantly changes structure. This company is slowly going down the drain.
bad,"Working there used to be fun. We all enjoyed working together and got stuff done when it needed to be. We got along well with management until they got a new front end manager who thought she ran the store. She has a bad attitude, talks down to every single person including the store manager, the district manager, and customers. Almost every person that worked there before she came along quite  right after she got there."
bad,Not a bad place to work if you're part of managements favorites.. although I can't speak for other stores. Which I've heard it's not bad if you have a good manager that's not a dictator.
bad,"POOR AND UNACCEPTABLE JOB ETHICS TOWARDS MY WELL BEING."
bad,"The schedule would say 7-4, but they'd shove all the deliveries for a given day on with whichever drivers were available, which was generally too few when they'd fire drivers for arbitrary reasons or seemingly go out of their way to make the job difficult and they'd walk out.  10 hour days were extremely frequent, 14+ hour days were not uncommon, and you wouldn't know what you were getting until you arrived at the store."
bad,"When I first started for Lowe‚Äôs, the vest made me appreciated and a part of something. Since the new CEO has taken over our benefits are garbage, the quality of new hires are garbage, the reliable and responsible are worked like mules, most of middle management is a joke, and the company that built and prided itself on customer service and employee happiness has been dragged out back and shot. Constant management restructure, increased worse health care plans, Little to no training, trying to reinvent the wheel every quarter, and lay offs of esstential services such as delivery and assembly in favor of unreliable 3rd party vendors has become the norm as well as obvious scramble to bail out a sinking ship that bit off more in recent history than it could chew or tear down a once respectable company by angering its customers and rewarding its employees hard work and loyalty by throwing thousands of them out in the street with no warning so the company‚Äôs numbers can look better for NYSE and they can get their 7 figure bonus. Enjoy that Christmas bonus, it‚Äôll most likely be mre‚Äôs and powered milk around here..."
bad,This job was a good experience for me and i learned a lot from it I only worked there for a couple months but I liked it and the people I worked with were good people put we got a lot of poor energy from the management
bad,"Management is not consist nor is there any support from them. 1st day on the job they scheduled me with my manager and coworker in the department off. I had no direction of anything. I didn't even have a working phone at my desk nor supplies to do the job. I asked my manager for the ideas I need to do my job I only received 2 items from my supply list out 10, but was expected to meet the sales goals weekly"
bad,"U work there for 6+ years, n they cut u down to 12 hours a week, n give the seasonal people more hours, or (their favorites) more hours. After working there all this time, call out sick maybe once a year, show up when there is a blizzard out, this is the thanks u get, time to find a new job!!!!!"
bad,"I felt like part of a team immediately, most of the people I worked with welcomed me immediately and I made a lot of good friends. The problem is corporate has a lot of rules and regulations that make working at this company miserable and you can tell the upper management in the stores are the one's suffering. The way they ""correct"" behaviors in workers is inconsistent and unfair as some people get punished while others don't. Favoritism runs ram pet as well. The fact that they have gotten rid of the in store HR is what worries me the most. There is a very high turnover rate and the employees and customers are the ones that suffer."
bad,Used to be such a good company. Not anymore though. Really run you into the ground. Increased work load with no consideration to rate of pay or quality of life. Bonuses became nutty to attain and budgets are not realistic.
bad,"The management, starting at the top, is absolutely inept. As long as the store is turning a profit, they're going to run a skeleton crew at all times. This leads to poor customer experiences and stressed out employees. The pay for hourly associates is insulting for the responsibilities and workload. This is a low paying retail job, with a factory job workload. Avoid at all costs."
bad,"Made a few friends even outside of work on the delivery crew. Our managers we had back there are no longer around but they were awesome the new guy is great. The Delivery Coordinator is nothing but terrible. Very lazy, very disrespectful, and is an absolute suck up. She is equal to Driver or anyone else in the back but acts like a manager and will tell management when we don‚Äôt do what she wants. She gets in 3 hours before everyone but still doesn‚Äôt have everything ready for the day and has everyone finish her work. Upper management is oblivious to her actions it‚Äôs ridiculous. Does everything in her power to get people in trouble or will even set you up. Every Driver is planning on leaving due to her and management. Management will attempt to give people write ups for almost nothing they pass them out like candy. There‚Äôs ZERO job security. They will believe anything and everything without visual/physical proof. No compromising at all managers abuse their power. The job as a delivery Driver is great when it comes to the other drivers, the job itself isn‚Äôt to bad some days are tough but the OT is very nice. Would be a perfect job if everyone in the store atleast tried to understand what we do. Most of the staff and managers in the store sit behind a computer all day and think we are magicians of some sort. No one has ever actually seen the physical labor drivers go through and other challenges. They think it‚Äôs 1,2,3 done. Don‚Äôt expect a pat on the back of any kind. Oh and receiving is nothing but incapable as well they do their best to delegate their job to the drivers even after"
bad,"During my time at Lowes, I sustained multiple injuries spanning from bruising to semi dislocations. The manager I was under told me to ""get use to it"", along with other off handed remarks towards myself."
bad,"They will get you to do as many things as they can and pay you as little as possible. That's the Lowe's way. The managers all hide in the back and 90% of the associates are completely worthless, leaving you to pick up the slack. Employees steal all the time and I can't say I blame them really. Lowe's is a total sucker job and the only reason you should work there is lack of options."
bad,"Without going on a extremely long rant I'll keep it simple. Managers are always MIA, the store is severely understaffed to the point that it affects other employees yet nothing was fixed about because the managers would just get other employees to fill in where other departments were lacking. Thus making forcing said employees to keep tabs on their originally scheduled department and someone else's department. This ultimately allowed for MANY angry and unserved customers. I could go on just take my advice Lowe's in Conyers, GA, just stay away from it. Don't do it to yourself."
bad,Nothing good to write about my experiences the last few years. Started out really positive. Then went down hill fast. Good ole boy rule in effect loud and clear.
bad,"Poca paga y despidos injusto, mala administraci√≥n por los supervisor"
bad,"Worked there for 6 Months and cleaned up there  Lumber side of the building As the Service Manager..All it took was a issue with a insubordinate employee and brought it to the Store Managers Attention.  It took him 6 hrs to fire that associate ,but then called me in the office and was let go also with 0 Reason..They don't care about you at Lowes..I even called the HR   manager and she told me that i didn't have my vest on and i came to work and walked through the wrong door , which told her i wasn't being a servant leader..I even called there hotline and even called the MARKET Manager and never got a call back..The company is a joke"
bad,"Lowes was not a bad job, but management was not very good. Really would have enjoyed working for Lowes had it not been for the mistreatment of management, and abuse of authority."
bad,The only thing Lowe's has is their pay and benefits.  The managers always side with the customer even when the customer is wrong and rude. It makes the employee look and feel worthless.
bad,"Would not recommend anyone work there. Super stress full, never enough help, customers walk out to go to their competitors, always negative feed back."
bad,Delivery is a joke here they want you to work 14 to 16 hours a day and if you work over your hours they have you lie about it they could care less about you or your family if you have to have a job they will take anyone. but keep looking
bad,"Work work and work, "
bad,"I took the job while going to school for about 2 years. It started off ok, but more and more people were being laid off or left. The call outs were the most I ever witnessed anywhere I worked. If you want to be alone half the time up front checking out hundreds of ill tempered people, go right ahead. They'v let go of some of their best and most loyal employees so if you plan on wanting to retire and get your pension, do not stay here..."
bad,"Each day I worked, I started on time unless management was late to open, which happened often. I signed in and went straight to my department and started cleaning, replenishing the shelves, putting away shipments that we receive, etc., keeping busy through out my shift. I enjoyed working with most of my fellow employees, helping out where needed. The hardest part of the job was getting management to help to get into places needed to get my work done. Also to respond to customers request. I learned that this work place doesn't want to better its self for employees and for customer retention."
bad,"I don't want to talk about it. the benefits were great , but the level of stress and the amount of work that was expected out of a single person was unreal."
bad,"The current store manager is a joke, and treats people like things while he plays favorites. I was let go for being ""intimidating"". Which is what I got for pulling a manager aside to tell her not to mouth off to my crew like she had been."
bad,Due to restructuring it has become a stressful work environment for all managers.  When the company recovers from this it should be a pleasant place to work again.
bad,"Lowe's used to be awesome, but with this latest corporate restructure, it's just horrible.  Nothing but chaos and stress!   There is no leadership, no direction for the new employees, no loyalty.  I have been with the company for 5+ years and always loved my job before this year."
bad,Not to write a completely negative review but in the spirit of honest review; the company is outsourcing many positions and this is impacting American workers.
bad,"Lowe's was a great company to work for until they decided to leave all they're department manager and some really good ASM's high and dry.  They promised to hold current pay for a year but management strong armed most into excepting low paying roles by messing with hours.  Very disappointed with Lowe's, I truly bleed blue for them."
bad,"Do NOT question safety policy if you don't want to be walked. Do NOT question the condition of the material handling equipment. Do NOT voice any opinion on anything. Do NOT voice anything negative about strange rituals like ""high five Fridays"" Pay structure is based on long tenure of 5 plus years to reach top wage. There is no raise on merit. The management team does not want to hear any constructive critism to improve. They are already the best in their minds. If you just need a job and can be a mindless automaton this is your kinda place!  WARNING! You will be walked for not being a Lowe's zombie"
bad,I have worked for Lowes as a ASM for two years and was RIF from my position on my birthday because of because of greedy excutives at the top.Please do not work for this company there is no job security there. The boys at the top are only looking out for themselves. Doesn't care about the rest of us. They change their strategy at the end of every fiscal year. Not a stabe company. The CEO has done a terrible job with the company and he needs to go work at dollar tree as a cashier and let him feel what it is like not to make money and get RIF. They have reduced their inventory in most od their stores and have caused less sales and majot laid offs in 2017.
bad,Job and pay were reasonable with the jobs asked. They are a great company for employee advancement if the employee is worth it. The particular location I worked at had a few bad seeds in management. They were decent workers but not so great people. Luckily they weren't in my everyday life. Just at work. Lowe's is probably one of the best part time jobs to go for. At part time I was eligible for some benefits
bad,"The work enviorment was kinda peofessional, but the overall management was not to good.doesn't pay enough for the work"
bad,"Normally as a Cashier you clock in, you get assigned a register and you log in to start Processing transactions as each customer comes to your register with items to purchase.  I learned that each job you encounter lots of people, you have to stay focus on each task you are assigned. You also have to know how to Multi-Task. I'm a people person so I enjoy being around positive workers. I didn't really find anything difficult about the job. My most enjoyable was interacting with each customer."
bad,"This Lowes store has numerous problems, starting with their archaic ""Genesis"" software that runs in a DOS Window with a very dated version of Windows. The only thing slower than their dated computer systems is watching paint dry. No email list of employees in each dept, When I asked for one, I was told ""Its around somewhere"". No Voice Mail either so messages for specific people had to be taken on paper and hand delivered. No time to do that so messages were lost and customers were angry. Lowes is doing business like stores did in the 1970's and based on their sales volume, its not working."
bad,"management cannot manage their way out of a paper bag. I enjoy the department im in. its fine if you can figure out everything on your own, morale is extremely low"
bad,"You were given a lot of free roam, at the cost of innovation. Tried too hard too mimic other competitors instead of creating their own niche. Store level employees had almost no power in ordering and pricing materials. Very micromanaged."
bad,"I held the fsa job for over a year at the store on airport in mobile, it was by far the worst job I have ever had. Not only are you under paid, the work load alone is set for 3 people but it is just you they expect you to sit And ride the floor scrubber for 3 hours out of an 8 hour work day then complete All your daily task which takes Bout 6 hours on a good day so day by day you get behind on your week no to mention the store is pretty much falling Apart in which they expect you to add in those repairs Along with riding the floor scrubber And doing all the other tAsk And don't forget All the other problems thAT other employees bring to your attention that hAve to be taken cAre of. As far as the benefits go yes they are good as long as you want to live in box to be able to afford them at 11.11 an hour,  and also its like being in his again everyone gossips if there is a certain problem you pretty much heR from everyone Bout it And yes every mAnager has there favorites if you are not on that list expect to hAve your hours cut With no chAnce to move up in the company, during my time my job was threatened 3 times one of which things I wasn't even present for while it happened????? Another time becAuse I had to call in sick in which I wAS written up and was put up for review and another because a few things I feel behind on do to my 3 he daily ride on the scrubber (if you don't scrub the floors from 8 to 11 be prepared to be chewed out)And everything else like I said its at least a 3 person job needles to say i found a way way better job And left that place high And dry without"
bad,Some of my coworkers were very nice and some of them weren't and there were actually a few adult (women) bullies. There were coworkers that worked hard and coworkers that didn't work at all!! I would have to do their work. The coworkers that worked hard always got told what they were doing wrong and the coworkers that didn't work -got away with everything they weren't suppose to do. It was a very UNFAIR place to work!!!! Management and upper management never talked to certain coworkers and they weren't friendly!! There was absolutely no communication between workers and management. Management did not do some things that they're suppose to do!! Which made me feel like I was running the whole department myself. I did not get very much help from management. The job that I had should've not been as hard as it was. Because I did not get help from my coworkers and management my job was much much harder than it should've been. Management only talks to workers they want to talk too.  I am very very happy I'm not there anymore.
bad,"hard to get promoted, wont work e=with hours from other jobs, Lie to you and write you up"
bad,"The benefits and pay were great, and I loved working Friday, sat and sun always having four days off, but if you don't work at the speed of the light they will be sure to let you go. They hire and fire... I hit my daily goal every day and got my bonuses but that still wasn't enough. Giving 100% doesn't cut it, and the management team was constantly changing."
bad,I used to love my job but it changed after we had a lot of changes in the store
bad,"If you like being dishonest with customers, this is the place for you."
bad,"It's so bad that instead of treat workers like people they treat us like slave, don't allow us to take brake, unload trucks with some times 800 to 1500 units by hand,NO BRAKE now cashiers allow to take it...."
bad,Just not a good place to work. I really hated every minutes of being understaffed and way under-appreciated.
bad,Lowe's has rapidly declined in the past 3 years. CEO is destroying Lowe's. Most likely he will bankrupt Lowe's and go back to Home Depot. Jobs are being replaced by outside companies or just cutting out jobs all together. Can't trust anyone. Management is always shifting. Only hanging on for the pay.
bad,"the culture at catskill lowes is non-existent. It seems like job morale is consistently down no matter what the task is. But at the same time all of the sales associates are some of the best people i""ve ever met in general . But the management teams treat associates like their just numbers at the end of the day, and lack basic social skills. But the workload of the job isnt bad at all, after a while if your working an 8 hour shift you'll be able to get all of your work done within an hour. But then theres no structure by the managers so when someone gets done within an hour in the morning they do nothing the rest of the day and assume the night shift will pick up all the slack and if the night shift doesnt finish the job their the party that gets blamed even though they worked for 8 hours out of their shift compared to the morning contributing close to nothing. Which isnt the morning shifts fault their doing what their told. At the end of the day to me that comes down to poor management and lack of direction given to my fellow associates"
bad,"Didn‚Äôt like it there, weren‚Äôt flexible whatsoever didn‚Äôt give hours when needed didn‚Äôt take time to train what was needed overall wasn‚Äôt a good place to work"
bad,"Corporate is all about numbers don't care about employees cashiers average about 14 hours a week , never enough people working, bathrooms are unsanitary ymmv"
bad,"Not enough hours, dont care about their employees. Their in people's business instead of minding their own, and if something happens to your family and you have only been there for 4 months you dont qualify for fmla they write you up."
bad,I saw a bag laying down near this water fountain I used the bathroom came out  went back to my class lunch went back to the bathroom to get some water it was still there so I picked it up went outside to smoke I looked in it to see if I could find an I‚Äôd or anything that would identify someone  it‚Äôs just makeup and earrings couple small things and a long tear down the side of the bag  I didn‚Äôt want anything to fall out  so I put it in my purse to bring to security  but forget I go out that night forget the next day then  I‚Äôm off for 3 days come back Tuesday and I‚Äôm told I stole from the company and terminated I forgot even put in a case with hr and never got back to me
bad,"Lowes was a great place to work, until all the changes came down from corporate. Who have no idea of what a customer wants on the floor. It is as if they are trying to take employees$ with experience & knowledge out, and bring in part time bodies to cover.  With no training given. "
bad,I worked for Lowe's for 12 1/2 years. I worked my way up to Front End Support Manager.. I loved my job but when the new ops manager and  new store manager came. Everything went down hill fast. They were so focused on their own careers they did nothing but bully and harass people out of their jobs. Lowes zero tolerance for harassment in the work place means absulotely nothing.
bad,It Was Alright Working With Lowes It‚Äôs Just Sometimes they‚Äôll try to belittle you and make you feel small you or like what you do isn‚Äôt great especially some of the head cashiers
bad,It was a great place to work for but they under appreciated most of the employees. I worked 40 hours a week and I wasn't provided with full time benifts
bad,"The culture is stuck because of bad employees who work the system, and unaware managers. They do easy work and get bonuses while new employees get difficult assignments and low scores, which will get them fired.  They have a high turnover because of this.  Upper management only focuses on numbers and not actual work in the warehouse.  High numbers do not equal actual work.  A very flawed system."
bad,"The job was great.  The rest of the company was lacking, especially in management area.  Enjoyed my job and taking care of my clients needs.  It was very rewarding for me to a good job."
bad,"My job maintains varying objectives each day.  I have varied experiences, and believe that it important to remain busy while at work.  Also, my colleagues make a great team."
bad,"Managent at the Lowe's I worked for was awful. they didn't care about their employees except for a handle. The had their favorites and if you didn't fall in line they got rid of you. If you want a management team that helps you grow, do not go to Lowe's."
bad,Was approved to work for Lowes after the HR manager got the go ahead to hire me. Even after I disclosed on the background check I had a conviction. Was told they got the OK to hire me. Great! Two months in they got told to terminate me due to my background. Still cant get my termination paperwork after almost 2 months of waiting.
bad,"if you need a temporary place to work until something better comes around then its fine, but this is not a long term employer for anyone. they don't care about their people, just making profits."
bad,Worked in outside lawn and garden. I knew alot of things that people might be looking for . I was a home owner myself and I had worked in construction for many years and had a good idea about how thing work and how to build things . So I had a bit of a head start
bad,The work place seems to keep getting better but the management keeps getting worse. The team is a good and hard working people. The management staff has a few problems with not agreeing with each other.
bad,"Store management is poor and does not provide employees with the necessary tools or support to do the job or assist the customer. Most days you are working a fast paced, stressful and overwhelming department by yourself. You are expected to help customers in a timely fashion but don't have the products, necessary machinery, information or assistance needed in order to do that which results in many customer complaints. Instead of Management trying to assist you, they ignore you but hold you accountable when customers are unhappy. Worked for this company on and off for a total of 13 years. It was a great place to work where management was more involved in the beginning, however that cannot be said now.  You can still find good management at some stores, but you are still dealing with stressful and overwhelming work conditions due to poor upper management, low employee to customer ratio, poor quality or damaged products and little training or information."
bad,Lowe's at one time was a great career but changes in their management and store operations was very hard to endure. Bonuses were cut out and were saved for corporate level jobs and a lot of manager jobs were cut.
bad,Answering inbound calls from employees and mangers regarding scheduling issues. Updated employees schedules for up to seven days out. Worked closely with the director and management department.
bad,"There were poor hours and poor management. I enjoyed the people that worked there but did not care for the availability on the shifts to work. as well as management, poor judgement of character."
bad,Most of the employees are great but management is bringing down the company. They let the lazy ones do nothing while the good ones bust there butt to make up for it it‚Äôs really sad that they allow this to go on and allow management to get away with the things they do and sadly it starts with he stolre manager
bad,no advancement or dependable workers.  the want cheap labor by cutting out experienced workers with part timers/ temp workers. middle managers are overworked.
bad,"The local level management was excellent, however upper management had a lot to be desired.  Way to many changes at the corporate level that really didn't fall in line with their values."
bad,The management doesn't know how to run a business and its as simple as that unfortunately. They promise there employees things that they can't come through with..... over all the Worst job I've ever had in my entire like. NEVER AGAIN will I work for this company!
bad,Not enough employees to run the Store. Management delicates tasks to the very few employees in the Store. High stress levels to get these tasks done as well as meet the Sales Target expectations.
bad,"I chose to stay with this company and go full-time because of the benefits and job security.  The bonuses for sales encouraged me to become a sales specialist.  In the year that I have been in this position I have only received a bonus once, and it was not a full payout.  We met our goals this last quarter and were still not given our bonus because our district as a whole did not meet their goals."
bad,Compensation/benefits are about the only somewhat positive aspect of this place--they're not awful.  Raises are consistently 3%.  Pitiful.  Management is utterly incompetent.  Vast majority of employees hate their job.  Customers generally upset because of these issues.  I really wonder who writes these positive reviews about this place.  Do yourself a favor and keep looking.
bad,It is a lot of drama not the best place to work. Managers do not know what they are doing. Me personally is a hard worker. Everyone does what they want.
bad,"Work was easy."
bad,"Company doesn't really care about the part time workers, they get it the worst when the summer season is over and the off season starts. Don't plan on making enough to pay bills and support a family on their part-time pay."
bad,Supervisors have absolutely no people skills which in turn filters down to hourly employees. Employees have no clue what they are selling due to poor management training. As for my job my supervisor did away with my job as Gate Guard and wanted me to be a spotter. A spotter walks along side a forklift operator to make sure they don't run over anyone. Not. Thus I am a proud former employee who did a great job in loss prevention. Needless to say Lowe's has a very high turnover rate.
bad,Lowe's is all about business but forgets to take care of their employee's. There is a toxic culture of gossip and negativity that is allowed to continue. People are not held accountable for their actions. Your schedule is consistently all over the place with hours and days and if you are full time you get one weekend off a month if you are part time you don't get any weekends off a month. You must request time off and hope you get it most the time you have to fight to get your time off.
bad,"I have a class A and was told I'd be driving the flatbed most of the time.  Lie.  They flat out lied.  The only reason I ended up on the flatbed was because a guy quit due to BACK PAIN!!  I drive the flatbed most of the time now, which is a pleasure, but 5 days in a row every other week I'm on a box truck.  It is back breaking work.  You deliver 31 cubic foot refrigerators everyday.  End of story.  They don't fit into customers houses so the have to be disassembled and then reassembled.  You may have 10 stops in one day.  You will hate it.  Every problem becomes yours because you are the last one touching the product.  These ""salespeople"", I came from sales, real sales, so trust me here, are really clerks.  I develop far more rapport with customers in the time Im around them than they ever could.  Look, I know it's rough out there, but if at all possible, keep looking!!"
bad,"Lowe's spends no time on training or curating the culture to create an experience.  They Micro Manage, and act like there is no value in what you offer.  Makes you feel like your easily replaced and that you are insignificant.  The environment is extremely stressful and it's unfortunate."
bad,Excellent place to work - and learn everything it takes to run the up keep of your property - learn every thing to maintain a good working house ! Co-workers are so pleasant to work with - MANAGEMENT SUCKS DO NOT TREAT YOU FAIRLY - PROBABLY WHY CO-WORKERS STUCK TOGETHER FOR SUPPORT !
bad,Lowes is not a bad place to work.  However some of the upper level store management needs a lot of improvement
bad, This job is not very hard but you have managers that will be all over you and down your back about things that arent as serious. You will be ask to do task that are not partt of your job. Most of there employee's are older people that dont really like most of the younger people. There is a manager who stay on you about every little thing and will work your nerves more than anyone you'll ever meet
bad,SUCKS!! no values! no job security! managers don`t care! what life balance! DON`T DO IT!!`
bad,I was told that I was getting a substancial raise then then manager only gave me a 10 cent per hour raise. He was the worst manager that I have ever worked for in my life.
bad,"Hectic, long days. Lots of hours. No work/life balance."
bad,not only is it commission based only but the commission you make is not even paid to you. numerous complaints from ex employees who haven't received their wages.
bad,It‚Äôs a job that don‚Äôt really care for employees personally life they do pay ok and the workers are a big high school gossip girls was a very uneasy environment
bad,"You can be working one day, then after 10 yrs. they call you into the office and tell you your done.  Downsizing, bring in 3rd party workers to replace you so they don't have to pay any benefits."
bad,"After working at Lowe‚Äôs for six months and making many friends with co-workers, I was told my job was being outsourced and was immediately released from my position."
bad,"I worked for Lowe's 12 years ago. Went back this year as seasonal with the promise of going full time after the season ends. I worked in several departments,  did whatever I was asked and then some. I applied for numerous full time positions there. Had interviews, and got turned down for each one."
bad,Really don‚Äôt have anything to say about working at Lowe‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt worked there in a long time.  At the time management was changed every year.
bad,Will not recommend a friend to work at Lowes because management is unwilling to deal  with problems facing employees. Management wants to push credit card applications all day and not look a employee in the eye and honestly follow through on an employee problem; In their eyes its ok  to give 50 percent as a manager when dealing with real serious employee concerns. The most detrimental thing I notice is that they never gather employees together to have a serious talk about what issue are going on with the store. Managements want to keep everything positive which means avoid having serious conversations.
bad,Run Run Run far away.. this place is a joke Class A/B Drivers keep looking elsewhere.. they have no respect for an human being they talk to you like you are beneath them the only time there nice is when your in there beginning stages of the Hiring process... No Training the guys they send you out with just treat you like a laborer they want teach you anything at all.. Management just sit around and joke about things all day and talk about workers. They day you will get 39+ hours a week that's if they need you if they can't use you your going home you they will have you off on a weekday but work all weekend the schedule is on a metric system oh yeah alot of favoritism at store 281.. High turn over rate of Drivers there... You will see why NOTHING IS IN ORDER.
bad,"It was a horrible experieance, I dont recommed anyone to work for Lowe's until they take care of all the lazy people in this company. Could have been a great place to work if everyone worked as a team and helped one another."
bad,"Once a good company, after a restructure in early 2017, looking for ways to terminate those close to, or at the top pay scale and replace with lower hourly associates. Have displaced or terminated 8 people at my Store alone and Store Management is reduced by half and expect it to work the same. No employee back up, counselling, mentoring, advising from whats left of Management, they will let you fall on your own sword if you make a mistake. No such thing as a reprimand, its termination. No such thing as a Pro Active LEADER any more - they got rid of them. They now Micro Manage. Abysmal work culture and atmosphere."
bad,excellent work schedule . opportunities for advancements were made available for all employees. management team was fair
bad,Work you very hard and only look out for Lowesl They will take advantedge of your kindness and use you.
bad,Management is pretty good but the other people you work with can be difficult or unintelligent.
bad,"Management was terrible, very cut throat, General manager had no people skills at all, he would throw things when budgets and goal weren't meet and team meetings.  Management would never come up to you and say Good Morning.  Managers and area managers were just in their position to reach their bonuses."
bad,"it's poorly staffed, and  half the time you're doing someone elses job wondering ""why the heck am I not making more for this garbage work"". Then you realize. They don't really care about you--- let that sink in before you apply at Lowes. Family friendly my behind."
bad,"Worst management experience I have ever been apart of. I can not stress enough how dysfunctional the management team at Lowes of Newberry SC is. Everything and anything is blamed on employees. When managers bonus time comes around they cut all other employees hours so they can ""meet the numbers"". No ""manager"" in this store should be in management. All of them are garbage.."
bad,There is sustainable work but there aren't many areas to advance. Work will vary from day to day depending on what is needed. The atmosphere is not high energy.
bad,"No one was ever on task, more worried about outside things than the store honestly. If you inform the managers nothing happens, because they're just as involved."
bad,"Very busy place. not enough workers and not enough pay. the managers pick favorites, But overall i loved working there because the customers are so nice."
bad,Wasn‚Äôt hired for no apparent reasons. I gave them a great interview and I‚Äôm a young bull that works hard. Terrible employment process and ya lost out on a good worker üñï
bad,"i moved to colorado from illinois about 4 weeks ago. Finding a job has been extremely hard, and lowe‚Äôs was my first offer. The process is very long, and each step took about 1 week. After waiting 3 weeks once revisiting the offer, and only 3 days before my physical exam (which is the last step) they decided to tell me they‚Äôre moving on to other candidates. i DO NOT recommend going through the painful process, as for now i am jobless and don‚Äôt have my resume submitted to any other jobs and denied a different offer because they HORRIBLY mislead me."
bad,"Wouldn't know where to start at this low life corporation!From the wrong job offer for driver helper to the slavery of the job itself to the NASTY attitude bruiser  cashier's.Do not even think about working here run like you've never run and don't look back!!! Hopefully they go bankrupt somehow!They,like many big box stores,have their pets and the rest is a revolving door of employees,they don't care!"
bad,"If you want to be rewarded for mediocrity, Lowe's should be your next career choice.  If you excel at dodging your actual job responsibilities and blaming your poor job performance on absolutely anything other than your actual self, you should apply at Lowe's.  If you feel like getting lost in a corporation whose only ambition is to ride the coat tails of it's competitor and devaluing the personal shopping experiences of its customers, you should apply as soon as possible."
bad,"Lowes was the worst place I have ever worked for. Towards the end of my time there, corporate had washed out all the decent managers and replaced them with rude, unfeeling managers that did not care for the business or their employees."
bad,"If you start at the bottom of the totem pole be prepared to kiss some butt, it‚Äôs the only way up. You‚Äôll be asked to do things by yourself when no other co workers are around when you need them. Ei. Operating power equipment to take product down when its Lowe‚Äôs policy to find a ‚Äúspotter‚Äù. Pay is a joke, made 17.50 as sales specialist with no commission while cashiers up front were making 16.But my department manager was still making commission? From a previous contract. Wanna go for a break? Good luck. Tell every employee in the building as per policy even though they won‚Äôt cover you anyway. Also they‚Äôll give you 7-8 day work weeks and none of it will be granted overtime, because you still only worked 5 days, even though it goes into next week."
bad,"Lowes homestead needs work on their management team , complete overhaul, they are very selfish and abuse employees to their benefit, stocker night time I would never recommend"
bad,Bad job it sucks I would never recommend this place to anyone the managers dont care about no one but them selves. This place is a bad place to work do noy work here.
bad,"I was with Lowe‚Äôs for two years, I worked any hours they asked  I offered to change my schedule to what would work better for the customers and availability for Lowe‚Äôs and they fired me for something I didn‚Äôt do"
bad,"Lack of training was the apparent from my first week. Even six months into the job, training was still lacking. No formal Lowe‚Äôs training after 6 months for the ASM. Hours swung consistently from  4:45am opening to closing from 12:30pm-11:15pm. Extreme early hours and the extreme late hours in any given week, plus the lack of training made me decide not to continue employment."
bad,"I was harassed by a coworker the entire time I worked at Lowe‚Äôs and nothing was ever done. Management protected him, as his mother was a manager and the manager over Inside Lawn and Garden was her friend. When I went to my store manager about the issue, he wasn‚Äôt even aware, despite three meetings with my manager and the fact she was supposed to report anything of the sort to him."
bad,Do not I repeat do not work for Lowe‚Äôs in lumberton. The management is absolutely horrible and in ways racist. They show favoritism towards who they want and treat anyone else like trash. The pay is way below what you should be getting paid to operate industrial equipment. I hated it. The manager on night shift won‚Äôt even speak to you or ask how are you doing today. He will tell you to get straight work and that‚Äôs it.
bad,I worked at store 2719. It turned into the worst job I ever had after they changed managment. They play favorites and if they pick someone they like over you they will let that person treat you how ever they want to and make you wish you'd never heard of the place. The work/life balance is non existant.
bad,Unorganized and highschool like mentality. Store manager let other managers get away with lackluster work. Bad supervisors and overall lack of effort.
bad,No training.  Sometimes didn't get a lunch break.  Expected to cover more than one department because of the fact that they don't hire enough people to cover shifts.  Management is too stressed out to help when you're in over your head with customers.
bad,"My position was terminated without notice whatsoever from the new CEO who is a heartless scumbag !!"
bad,"One of the worst places I‚Äôve ever worked.  The store manager punishes its employees and managers. Schedules do not follow employment standards and anything goes.  On duty managers are useless and follow the direction of the SM.  HR is not allowed to perform their job or assist anyone. Basically, this store management style is so backwards and outdated that clearly this company is going no where fast."
bad,"The Brantford location is filled with poor management.  When issues were brought to the Store Managers attention that were illegal nothing was done to rectify the situation.  It resulted in the ASM who should've been reprimanded to taking their anger out on the employee by essentially forcing them out of the company."
bad,Lowe's was a great place to work before the new CEO took over! There was a sense of pride and caring before the new management took over. Uncertain futures and penny pinching killed the caring employees.
bad,It‚Äôs good and bad there isn‚Äôt that much good but there isnt that much wrong with Lowe‚Äôs either they hire on the spot and it‚Äôs good pay depending on the hours
bad,"If you like to be forced to not take lunch breaks and work 12+ hours, and then be screamed and yelled at all day by management and customers...then this is the place for you! I worked here for 14 years and everyday it got more worse. The turn over is ridiculous..."
bad,"Horrible hours, management playing favorites, management not standing up for you when customers got verbally abusive and managers not standing behind policy, bends policy when they see it fit."
bad,"Cannot keep good workers if they wanted to. Short staffed and management is awful. Weird hours and unbalanced with personal life. Change the schedule every 24 hours. Quick to point the finger. This store is led by a man with a job titled store manager , not a leader! They frown at you for working overtime?!?! Worst place to work in my opinion. Unfair pay scale. I could go on..."
bad,"Management plays a large part in the success of any organization and Lowes is no different. It is easy to see that when there are some good ones as well as bad ones in one location. A good manager gets people to want to work while a bad one had to push people to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is inter-reaction with customers but, unfortunately, the amount of time that you are allowed to do that, with some managers, is limited by the time you are doing stock work. When customers are looking for assistance, you should never be climbing a wall to fill in a stock hole. Some managers don't seem to understand that."
bad,Horrible management and job enviroment!  You will regret it. It will drain you..use you.. And get rid of you whenever its convinient because they dont want to pay you your worth
bad,"I had heard advancement is great within Lowe‚Äôs, but after 1 year doing incredibly and hitting stat goals I didn‚Äôt even have an interview! Upper management is terrible, they never know what they‚Äôre doing and very rarely consider the impact of their decisions on the agents. If you need to work at a call center, don‚Äôt choose this one"
bad,"I worked the warehouse for Lowe's which is only available as part time employment because there is usually only 1 truck to unload every day. The pay was pitiful. Considering this was the most physically tasking job on the site, you are paid less than literally everyone else at $11.45 an hour. There is also a fridge that is supposed to stay stocked with water to keep us hydrated without having to spend what little money we make however when it's emptied, it can only be allowed to be restocked by a manager and while there are 4 to 5 of them on site at all times, finding one that is willing to step aside from their beaten path for a few minutes to do this for you can be next to impossible. When I brought this up with a manager, I was lectured for speaking to him ""out of place"". Furthermore, the truck can typically be finished with a couple hours to spare at which point management sends the entiret y of the unload crew into the isles to literally do every one else's jobs. You will be stocking, organizing, and storing product around the store while the department representatives whose job it is to do these things, play on their phone. You WILL see this happen almost every day. I also brought this up with management  however every word out of my mouth was dodged and dismissed.  Said manager did give me a verbal confirmation that these duties are not written in our contracts however his exact words were, ""you are still expected  to do them"". Regardless of the fact that it is in the contract of the employees who spend the last half of the evening wasting time on their phones."
bad,"They promote from within ONLY if you're in the right clique or kiss the ring of management!"
bad,"There have been many changes at Lowe's, and its hard to say they have been for the better. Skeleton crews to run the store is the only thing you will see, and talent is walking out the door both in management and associate positions. "
bad,"They are not worth anyone's time to not apply for Lowe's home improvement, they will treat you like dirt, and make you feel like your not good enough, and they will fire you for just about anything. Oh you sneezed to loud your fired and I'm not joking, this place of employment is a bad joke."
bad,"Don't be bothered.                                      "
bad,The HR department was unprofessional and catty. Gossip from management and leaks in privacy. Management did not care for senior citizens in the DC location.  They put a 70 yr old woman out in the worst summer ever and she almost fainted.  I had 2 heat strokes and they did not call the ambulance.  Instead I was told to go in the break room for 15 mins to cool down after I passed out on the bag part of the cashier's register.  Never work  there.  They have a high turnover rate for a reason!
bad,"Management is terrible, they hire anyone and doesn‚Äôt give them proper training, just throwing people to the wolves. No opportunity for advancement. Treats their best employees terribly and somehow praises the terrible ones. They don‚Äôt pay you enough to even live off of. Basically if you aren‚Äôt a manager or a specialist, your pay is nothing. And they overwork you."
bad,"managers have no clue how to work and nobody trains you. they leave you looking like a moron, never enough employees. machines do not work, the only people that know how to work are the ones that have been there for years. you will be looking for help like customers look for help"
bad,"I was a star until I was injured at work, and then I was a problem. Management sought to get rid of me from that point on. For the most part, management was simply a club that very few could gain admittance to, unless you kissed the managers butt."
bad,"The front end (cashiers) manager and his helper are REALLY good at NOT working. They push off their responsibility to anyone else they can! The red head spends almost all day giggling in the office with a ‚Äúhead cashier‚Äù who waddles around acting superior all day. The three of them could be replaced by one hard worker really easy! Never ask these tree to do something that‚Äôs part of their jobs. They‚Äôre way too busy. Yeah, right. At least the store has a new manager who keeps breaking up the lazy people chitchat sessions!"
bad,Loews is not a place to establish your career. Lots of changes thru out the company. They have not been stable recently. Lots of turn over and termination of employment.
bad,"Management is extremely poor! All of them are engaged in a power struggle and it promotes a very stressful work environment.  It also broke apart the team work we used to engage in. "
bad,Ok place to work if retirees or if students are living at home with parents but for a Mother‚Äôs trying to provide for their families thumbs down company doesn‚Äôt have a heart or care
bad,"For the first two months I worked there, I was working anywhere between 50-70 hours a week.  My store was overloaded with deliveries, because for some reason they all got offloaded onto us, so we'd be driving for absurd amounts of time just to drop off something another store could have done.  I'm talking well over 100 miles in a day some days to go well outside of our region."
bad,"Head Cashier Responsibilities and Duties. Oversee cash transactions, cash reconciliations, account payments, account receivables and other accounting duties according to company policies. Welcome customers, provide assistance and respond to their concerns. Manage customer transactions both cash and card payments."
bad,"Not a good place to work bad management poor morale no room for advancement. All about customers not associates. No formal training, hard to get time off horrible retail hours and split days off unable to schedule family events ."
bad,"ever since the new CEO took over lowes is a nightmare to work at. no more full time 8 hour days. one day you could be working 5 hours next day 10. here's the best you only get 6 weekends off a year, wheres the family orientated business model? they say no one  will work more then five days in a row, wrong, sometimes i work 8 days straight before one day off, that's another thing no more two days off in a row. will never work there again. company is only for the upper management who get high pay and bonuses . we used to get commission selling appliances , that been gone for a while. stay away from this place."
bad,"They are not flexible with your schedule. They say in your training you will have a mentor, I was trained by 5 people in one day. Suggestion don't start someone new on a busy day. Have at least a manager be there for your first day. And more training on the registers before going out on the floor to be trained would be nice."
bad,They sit in their office and watch the camera's if  you take your phone out for a minute they come to you and tell you to put it away and treat you like your in elementary school or see you sit for a minute the same thing after you bust your but unloading pallets and stocking shelves the niskayuna store sucks
bad,Being a cashier was fun but not for this company. The employees would gossip about each other and even get physical with one another and the Human Resources department never did anything about it.
bad,This job paid better than most places but had random scheduling. Not even people scheduled to work when needed and the hours were randomly and never consistent
bad,It was ok Although I didn't work for Lowes. I worked for Lowe's food. I can only speak through former employees that worked at Lowes Hardware. People say it was awful.
bad,"If you are looking to be valued, look elsewhere. This company does not treat employees in a professional manner and does not care to develop talent. Training will not be provided and management will carry a sink or swim attitude."
bad,"Working at Lowes was a horrible experience, poorly managed, pay was not worth the work, hours were inconsistent and they favored those they liked to give hours to."
bad,In the district I worked for hard work and dedication meant nothing. It call came down to stroking egos. Loved the company when I first started but was happy when I left
bad,to much liberty and freedom is given to managers (not leaders) to adversely interrupt livelihoods.  the corporation looks after its self at the expense of its hourly employees. i would not recommend working for this organization .
bad,Lowes pays low wages with zero overtime. You are on your feet all day which can hurt if you are not prepared. Because it is the retail industry you are expected to work most weekends.
bad,"management promises you 30-40 hours a week when starting maybe even some overtime but it doesnt last, after 2-3 month they will drop you to 20 or less hours a week and its barely enough to pay bills where i live"
bad,"This is a decent job to make a little money before deciding what you really want to do. Some managers are useless, but there are 1 or 2 that aren't too terrible. But the customers WILL ALWAYS be right, so be prepared."
bad,the store I work at has very inconsistent management one day they will tell you one thing the next day something else. Corporate 95% of the time always sides with the customers even when they are in the wrong as well.
bad,"There is no typical day at work with at this location.  The managers are nice, but the store is consistently understaffed and they will overwork you if you have the aptitude."
bad,"Cut a lot of hours and always slow paced. I was not happy with the company when I served the HR department with my protective order. Instead of being flexible and working with my schedule and the employer who was on my protective order schedule, they asked me to resign since I had not been working at Lowe‚Äôs as long as he has."
bad,"here again, it was to long ago...  and another job I worked a short time. We were doing resets and traveling all over.  Had some family issued that required I not travel.   Went on to work closer to home for stores like Macys."
bad,"Lowes restructured yet again, and eliminated 1-2 ASM positions without any notice. I was one of those associated. They also reduced dept managers from 14 to 5. They only care about the bottom dollar and higher ups bonuses."
bad,being surrounded by good people and doesnt mind to lend a extra hand to get the job done it has decent pay and i would recommend to the next person to apply.
bad,"Poor poor management"
bad,the upper management are horrible people very unprofessional the hr manager is worse than you would imagine zero professionalize with her would not ever go back
bad,"Lowes is highly driven fast paced business ..If customer service is your thing this still may not be for you..very demanding very little compensation ..If anything buy stock in the company ,cause all they care is about the company.."
bad,The place is horrible store manager from 1672 is sexism and lots of favortism and lies a lot management is horrible woman there get treated very bad  they need a clean sweep and bring in new christian management and when you tell hr the issues there is no result to fix the problems do not work here the store is ok but management is the worst team I have ever seen so there are other places where listen here ladies you will be appreciated.
bad,"Lowe's is a brand new experience for me. I am learning how to be a great phone operator, however I must deal with rude customers. The work is too fast paced and not something I look forward to in a full time job."
bad,Entry level job so expect entry level help from management. Breaks are only provided if workload/staffing permits. If you're a motivated and hardworking employee be prepared for an increase in workload.
bad,"IF Lowe's had the correct managers in the appropriate spots, they're business would grow tremendously. This place allowed me to become someone that I didn't recognize, and did not like."
bad,Return policy is questionable. Be prepared to give money to junkies who steal from your store. And make sure to do it with a smile on your face because that's what corporate expects.
bad,Management needs help and work culture is very negative. Customers have issues as well as  employees. Do not recommend location to others for employment.
bad,I have no comment I do not wish to talk about lowes. what so ever. I had a very bad experience both times that I have worked for the company. underappreciated. understaffed
bad,"Lack of professionalism"
bad,I would recommend this company to anyone. It is a excellent place to work and has great employees. The company has since closed and folded. ...........
bad,Recently restructured and seems like there is less accountability and managers left from the restructuring don't seem valued.  Freight flow issues and upper managers don't seem to worry much or be sympathetic towards customers and employees. Not as many opportunities for advancement anymore.
bad,"I was let go by this company twice.  They called it a restructuring within the company, I was a very hard worker and I loved my job here. I took phone calls, e-mails, and faxes from customers and stores to find electronic receipts for them."
bad,"Location isn't really great, i haven't worked there in a long time, but i understand that they've made a bunch of improvements since I've left"
bad,you never know what your doing even if you have a specific job. there are too many department and assistant managers and they are all on different pages about what needs to be done and who needs to do it. they change your schedual and do not tell you then repremand you for being late or early.
bad,"I took this job, to help learn about remodeling some fore closed houses I made into rentals, for that it was a great job, the management is another story."
bad,"Some days are slow to very slow almost no customers. Bad scheduling for shifts needed.  Store manager is bad , assistant store managers are worst. They allow customers to take advantage of how the want to buy and to spend. They also allow customers to talk so rudely to all employees for the sake of making money."
bad,Changing management and lack of communication created a tense work environment and conflict and confusion with the employees and management.
bad,I was brought in during the summer and they did not tell me that my position was a seasonal position so one week the head of hr told me you don't have a job next week so i really didn't not like that about working there.
bad,bad company rules bad managment overall company a lot of workers very humid worked part time on weekends i learned experance working in a mind set ware house for 20 years
bad,My work day get there find lead ask where I was today most time I was out side helping people. Everyone there was really nice.The job wasn't really hard sometimes you had to help move things but other then that you rally just helped people all day and cleaned.
bad,managers suck customers are rude. managers will fire you if you get caught doing their dirty work in front of regional managers. Dont work here
bad,"The job itself was ok, but the work area was bad because it was in a bad area with a lot of violence where it was located. A lot of killing an bad things happening and the warehouse kept getting robbed. It was a poor security an people really didn't care bout their job nor did they take it serious."
bad,"They tell you what you want to hear at interview as far as pay rate,  hours, scheduling, and once your hired everything changes. The position your hired to do ends being 4 to 5 different positions. They utilize your skills that's for sure at bare minimum pay."
bad,This was an overall terrible experience. The store manager was extremely sexist and rude to all women including myself.
bad,"A basic work day is you come in and unload a truck. If there is no truck prepare to pick up other departments slack. Your co-workers say they need help in a department, while you are ""helping them""they are snacking in the break room."
bad,"Don't regret working for the company, but when you make a mistake they don't care how good of an employee you where. They don't have consideration."
bad,Delta Airlines is a overall great company to work for with great benefits and great people. Ideal company for truly dedicated people.
bad,I have nothing good to say about Lowes so I will say nothing. With the exception that I will miss my co-workers and customers.
bad,I enjoyed helping customers. Lots of room for advancement. Hard to be on feet all day. Co workers were great. Management did not do a good job scheduling.
bad,"Little To No Help When Needed, Poor Training Skills,Unfriendly Work Environment. I do not recommend this for first, or second time employees."
bad,"You had to worry about getting fired, you're basically just a number here and they will get rid of you in a heart beat A typical day at work was just loading and unloading trucks which is not so bad! i learned a lot about safety and teamwork. we would have a new coach every other week, from different areas of the building, so how are they supposed to lead and guide us if they are clueless? nothing was really hard just nerve racking sometimes because if you dropped a piece of paper you got a incident report!"
bad,"You go into work and you have to be clocked in, grab an LRT, and at the start-up meeting BEFORE your shift time. The worst part is having to load trucks. Very very physically demanding. The other departments were easy but Shipping is the worst department and worst job i have ever had. If you get hired into the shipping department,either transfer or run while you can."
bad,pulling orders. making sure your orders are accurate and discovering the new items being sold
bad,Fun place to work.  Standing all day and walking around helping customers was very fun.
bad,Lowe's is a great place to work. there is always something to do. I have learned to manage my time more carefully to get all my duties done in the day. management is very helpful and is always there to listen or when you need to talk. my co-workers are excellent and very engaging in activities and conversation. the hardest part of the job is when I do not know what to do with a certain task and no one is available to help. the most enjoyable part of my job is I am always busy. I am never bored and I am always learning something new.
bad,"Each shift is ran differently,makes it hard on the employees,G.M is very two faced"
bad,"I have no valid input on this, standard work to the bone retail."
bad,Rotating schedule. Working outside. I do not mind the work. I enjoy working with the people in my department.
bad,i didn't enjoy working at mc.donald because there was a lot of rude people and it was very hard to work with the management.
bad,"A typical day at is very chaotic I am doing paperwork, paying bills, walking installers out, answering phones.  Ensuring that a customer's install goes well.  I've learned how o work under pressure and meet deadlines.  My management team was great ,they empowered us to make discussions without them. My coworkers are my family because its such a small office, we've look at each other as a close knit family.  The hardest part of the job is trying t make so many different people happy: the customers, the installers, your coworkers, and the management team, and still abide by rules and regulations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the control chaos, the office is always busy"
bad,"Clock in, pull up worklist, complete worklist. Learnt forklift skills and customer service."
bad,"I worked here until March of 2012, when I decided to go back to school.  Management was not very respectful or considerate, and communication at all levels was very poor."
bad,"Friendly staff."
bad,The is not a fun place to work. But the pay is nice and that is the most important thing anyway.
bad,Everything is systems driven.  I learned about their systems. Direct management great.  Upper management horrible.  My peers easy to work with.  Hardest part the entire Lowe's system and staff.  Nothing was enjoyable
bad,"Six months there as a seasonal employee in lumber and not once in all that time was there any praise from any of management, only ridicule."
bad,Like the job.Work as a temp let me go because of my past would still be working there now.
bad,Fun job but management is rude and very disrespectful to lower employees.
bad,"This company is totally different than the one I started working for 7 years ago. The focus has shifted from the people and customers to the bottom line. Used to love it, now they are just like all other greedy companies trying to satisfy stock holders."
bad,"Lowes was a good transition job till I got on with Spenards, the hours and schedule was very difficult to plan anything like vacations."
bad,the management was horrible and incompetent. the job was easy but management was unbearable
bad,dont work there. it just made life complicated. drama..and full of mess.
bad,Management did not care about employees at all!!!!!! Store manager was very degrading towards employees.
bad,Bad for professionals. The company does not believe in hiring people who know what they are doing because they do not want to pay them.
bad,"The beginning was fun, i met new people, we all became family, everyone helped you. But, towards the end, there was too much ""nonsense"" going on."
bad,"Guided outside agencies and an in-house team to visualize, create and sell memorable marketing concepts. Navigated in a complex corporate structure to convince internal associates as to the merits of new ideas. Pushed for progressive results within an agency model. Maneuvered within the parameters of an enormous traditional retailer during precarious and cautious economic conditions."
bad,they are now more concerned with executive compensation than the well being of the employees
bad,"At the Hollister, Mo. store I did not receive adequate training, I actually had to request additional training. Employees were rude to one another, employees did not work as a team, a couple of the head cashiers would belittle employees in front of customers and other employees, bad employees were allowed to continue to be rude to customers while good employees were allowed to leave without anything being done to retain them. HUGE TURN OVER!!!!! No designated trainers."
bad,"In business as in life it is difficult to plan operate, set goals, and develop strategies to achieve and surpass those goals if you do not have a clear vision of what your future will or should look like. That is the difficulty with this organization. Too much uncertainty without any clear direction from upper mgmt."
bad,"Management either likes you or doesn't. Part timers are either seasonal workers putting in over time, or have 10 or less hours a week. Full timers are expected to cover multiple departments with little to no help while managers tell you what you're doing wrong from their office. Customers are really nice in this area with the occasional upset person. Ordering from suppliers is always miscounted and often doesn't come in at all. Overall the job is not that bad, but there are a bunch of problems that could easily be fixed with better management both local and corporate."
bad,I liked working there people were nice but they didn't really care if you had anything you needed to do. the hardest part if the job was when you had to put together a grill or something you haven't done before
bad,They make you help other departments when they call off and you know nothing about it.some co workers do nothing well we work hard and they tell you want to do like they are the managers. I just didn't really like it there.
bad,"Work life balance was good, the pay was okay. Management was like working with sasquatch.  I did actually like what I did there but didn't feel very appreciated."
bad,"Working at Ageis is a acceptable job,just to pay the bills. The manager was very rude, talk to you in a harsh way. I jus didnt like theat job."
bad,"Lowes is a fast paced environment,   The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishment you get when you help a customer through a project.   The hardest part of working for Lowes is the lack of productive management."
bad,"Typical home improvement store."
bad,"its like giving back to the community, we worked together as a team, to build these homes in a month or less, and we were fed for free, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the family who the home had been built for see their new home for the first time."
bad,my managers and the people i work with are great for the most part just a little uncalled for drama at times. the hardest part of the job would be how boring it gets at times because it can get really slow and i like to always have something to do.
bad,"I worked in the flooring department, learned a lot and everyone learns how to drive forklift, you take a lot of tests to build knowledge in the field you are working in which helps and guides you."
bad,Fast paced always moving around various shifts a major company great benefits. A great place to work in retail lots of experience
bad,Lowe‚Äôs has a friendly environment with friendly customers. To keep pace you really have to learn all about the tools and appliances. That‚Äôs about it. Due to to me having a child and going to school they helped with me working around my schedule. Good job great benefits.
bad,assist customers all day help all customers in making decisions for themselves.
bad,"Excellent place to work, great people to work with as well as the managers really care about there workers! I would recommend this place to work to anyone! Even friends and family!"
bad,"I was usually put in different places throughout the day, where ever I was needed.i got to know the whole store & I didn't mind at all.I was willing top work where I was needed. Great company to work for. I did give a 13 day notice when I had to leave lowes,due to family situations."
bad,"Typical day was unpredictive, but Sunday's were extremely busy always."
bad,I love working for the company. It‚Äôs one of my favorite job that i‚Äôve had thrust far. I really try to get the work out about my job because i know plenty of people that would enjoy working in the company.
bad,Lowes is a great place to work. Meet new people. learn so many skills u can use at home. I worked here for a very long time and would go back if I could lol
bad,"Hostile work environment with no advancement and minimum wage pay. This was only good of you are seeking to gain 20 hours a week ."
bad,"I used to love working for Lowe‚Äôs but since the new CEO made so many changes, the work culture went way downhill. I didn‚Äôt feel supported by managers and there is little or no room for advancement anymore. Lowe‚Äôs cares more about making money than about the good people who have been with them for years. Only reasons I stayed 8 years were my awesome co-workers."
bad,Management is severely lacking in Training and People skills. Lowe's is no longer about Work/Life balance for employees but more so making the Share holders happy!
bad,"Favouritism is rampant, no support from management, only advance if you know someone, layoffs constantly, no job is safe, terrible scheduling. No weekends"
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees. The only thing they care about is if they get a bonus. Not encouraging at all and even tell their employees that they're replaceable.
bad,Hired as seasonal with a chance to become full time but if you don't kiss up to management you will be out. I worked hard but that didn't mean anything to them.
bad,Poor work environment u get treated like dirt n worked like a mule n the pay aint worth it. It cruddy job managment aint all there n delivery sucks worse no management or supervisor communication skills
bad,Every ones life is thrown on a table for display. HR visits are a high frequency and you are expected to go above and beyond for minimal pay and. the over time only helps because there is so many people that call out.
bad,Under staffed they cut a lot of hours on employees then expect you to work their department and others while cleaning the store and doing customer assistance and if it‚Äôs not all done they bad talk you and if u try and do everything and go beyond your hour of work u get in trouble cus your over the hours your supposed to work
bad,Too many changes.  No one helps or does their job.  Everyone basically stays in the breakroom and screws around. asset protection loves accusing people of things they themselves are NOT In fact doing.  The company doesn't care who they hurt so long as they get what they want when they want it. employees are rude to other employees. some act better than others.
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is not a job for a person that wants a future or a respectable salary. "
bad,"There is not a lot I can say positive about Lowes, at one time they where a great place to work. No it's all about money and making the numbers. I think the people upstairs have forgotten who really pays them."
bad,I was happy before getting the worse store manager I have ever seen or worked for in my life so far. Worked people to death them bitched about them getting overtime or demanded that they work 12 hour shifts like an ASM but not receiving any of the benefits of being one. Was lied to when told to go to overnights for 6 months then it turned in to 4 years and always told that the next day shift would be available to me I just have to apply for it. Still nothing after waiting 4 years I decided to talk with the management and nothing no remorse didn't even care that I was going through the worst time of my life while on overnights but they pride themselves in being employees first and wanting to help make sure that everyone is happy were they are at. But not that SOB at that location.
bad,"Management sucks and you get written up for stupid stuff while everyone else gets away with not staying in their department,  not doing freight, disappearing and not helping customers. If your in upper management they stay in their office and only on the floor unless the store manager is working other than that they are not worth anything except for one."
bad,Constant change.  Have good people leave as positions are constantly changing or being deleted.  No fair with their own policies with each store.  Wouldn't work there
bad,Lowes was not a good fit for me. Management did not know what the left or right hand was doing at any given time. Sad but true. there was no job discription just the hay you policy. Hay you do this Hay you do that. And this did not work for me.
bad,"Same as Home Depot, with a few difference no scream, big pluss for me. No set up for failure. It is not what you know, but who you know culture. Little or no communication between management."
bad,Lowes is horrible to work at. Hard to move up management does not care about you having a life. They will schedule you whenever they need to. You cant move how in that company. No matter how hard you work there. Everyone calls off and nothing gets done about it and you get screwed at the end.
bad,at Lowes you are only a number they do not care about you or your homelife what so ever. The people who have families and would occasionally would like a weekend with them forget it. As for pay they pay minimum wage no matter what your skills they will not give you full time no matter how long you work there. It took over a month after I left to get my holiday pay
bad,Really would6say anything  I would not shop there or work there again the company wouldn't let you help customers and fired me because I was sick that is all there is to say
bad,Honestly the Lowes I worked at had nothing that the company stood for. It was a mess and a disaster. The upper management team did not care about their employees at all only numbers.
bad,"I started off working part time, which according to Lowes is 14 hour days 6 days a week with no benefits. Management treated everybody like they were expendable."
bad,"The management is horrible, and need to understand they are not going to keep workers, because of there poor attitudes. They are also unprofessional, tell workers private business when they are not suppose to."
bad,"The main complaint I recieved from customers was the lack of staffing. The lack of proper staffing lead to a very poor work culture,managers would hide out in various locations rather than coming to the floor to help provide customer support and service"
bad,"You have to work various hours and nothing is set too far in advance. Store is open for business 6 am - 10 pm with some holiday exceptions for shorter days. You are not trained well, so if you have experience in the department your placed in - your lucky. Otherwise figure it out, work hard. Customers appreciate your efforts but you‚Äôre on your own. "
bad,"The management team is terrible. They don‚Äôt know their job and except you to do theirs for them. "
bad,"clean up after workers at night, stock and restock merchandise "
bad,"There was constant stress and pressure, while being held accountable for things that were not my job, was ignored by management when requesting help or when we needed the bay door opened to be able to start unloading, there is very blatant favoritism as well as blatant racism against anyone who is white."
bad,When they hire you they say you are hired for 1 position and when you start it‚Äôs another position and the lie if your full time the management sucks here and the hours are terrible they have you there at 12 or 1 am for no reason go someplace else I have because so depressed since working here
bad,"This place uses you and spits you out.  They will run you into the ground.  Its like high school if you are not well known, or know the right people, or popular you cant get any advancement."
bad,"Its fine if you only intend to work there temporary. Managers play favorites, health benefits are terrible, pay is meh could be better but could also be worse, and work itself is incredibly stressful. Corporate and managers make it painfully clear that you dont matter and are easily replaced. Everyone likes to pass job responsibilities onto other people and heaven forbid you refuse to do others work, you'll get written up. Again it's fine if you work there for a few months but it's not a place to try and make a career of."
bad,severely Understaffed underpaid the management is never around when you need one it had to be one of the most boring and stressful jobs I have ever had
bad,"Lowes likes to throw new programs to see what sticks."
bad,"Management shows extreme signs of nepotism. Front end manager changes your schedule without giving you notice. Work-life balance is nonexistent. Unless any promises are in writing, don't expect them to hold up their end of anything. No positive reinforcement, most managers rule by imposing fear. Lots of drama and very back stabbing environment from most managers and supervisors."
bad,"The overall management lacked the training they need to be able to function as a store. The regional manager, comes in only when the store is getting something and acts like he understands the associates on their level, when in actuality, he really does not."
bad,"Literally, just enough to survive, but not enough to live. Advancement is almost non-existent, and 90% of the managers are incompetent. This is the place dreams go to die."
bad,"Those that work do not get rewarded. They are only made to do more to make up for those who do not work.  Rather than firing incompetent people they just move them to different departments and look the other way"
bad,Poor place to work not enough hours make you do more than expected no raises management is very poor customers very rude certain staff very rude not a good place to work
bad,"Lowe's isn't heading in the direction that they claim to be.  They say that they are doing great things.  They hired a ton of new employees and then cut all of their part timers to 8-12 hours a week, but expect those employees to have open availability."
bad,When I applied online to the Lowe's it showed my job starting at $12 per hour to $14 per hour. Despite my experience and good work ethic I found out after being hired that I was only making $11.69 per hour and had no benefits even though I am full time. Lowe's has a poor attitude when it comes to paying employees the pay that was promised them. I wouldn't go back to this job even if it was the last one on earth.
bad,Working at Lowe‚Äôs was very stressful and provides a poor work/ life balance. Management is poor and the culture is poor. Opportunities for advancement are very few.
bad,"This job was BORING!  I was a cashier and it was terrible.  I was bored 24/7, there was nothing to do when there was no costumers.  The only good thing was the amount of breaks and the pay.  I got paid by my experience so it was good to see that I got paid what I deserved.  That was the only good thing."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Management stinks, it‚Äôs very one sided, too much drama, the favoritism kills the want to work there. I dread going to work every day."
bad,I've worked for lowes for 3 years and have slowly watched it go downhill. The bellingham store manager is the worst manager I have ever had to deal with.
bad,"I was a hardworking punctual manager as were many of my friends, jobs were restructured or eliminated altogether. Management made us feel like our opinion mattered but they became hostile and threatened if questioned or challenged. Maybe it was just in the location I worked in but even our district Manager was an egomaniac and not very nice in addition."
bad,"Lowe's Employees are the best very low paying jobs though, Never consistent  working hours. They set you up for hours that are not reasonable they are not willing to work to help employees "
bad,"It was a fun job, but the manager was taking kick backs from vendors and made it feel like a very morally gray company to work for. I am glad I don't work there any more"
bad,they always advertise an open door policy but never seem to commit to that unless you were one of the favorites. management was extremely terrible half the time you couldn't trust them with any thing. I hope to never work for a company like this.
bad,"I loved my job at Lowe's it was the management I did not like. The puck their favorites, those people walked around in a pack laughing having a good time. When I went to my manager she did not want to here it.I felt discriminated against. I tried to get along with all the girls upfront, but it was hard. When you have one person telling them to do whatever and then I come over and give them a job to get done, and they would look at the other supervisor and keep on doing whatever she wanted."
bad,"Pros: coworkers "
bad,The schedule was inconsistent and always changing. You barely get any hours. They basically had kids telling adults what to do while they played on their phones and stood in one place being non productive.
bad,its retail it is very fast paced enviroment. alot to do everyday. alot of customers every day. assisting customers find what they need and are looking for.
bad,"It was exciting the first week to work at Lowes. Customers and staff seemed amiable. But in fact, staff were unprofessional, rude, and played favorites. They were inconsistent and gave hours to those who they wanted, not based on hard work--they gave hours to their friends."
bad,"Lowes blows balls it was all bad everything there sucked, the managers walked around with their hands up their rears and the hours and days off really sucked"
bad,"when I worked there, it was basic ... I can't use badwords. for every oncall week, there were stupid processes put into place not to get anything done or to make any sense, everything seemed to be designed to make things more difficult and near impossible to use.   nobody ever cared that processes or gear were broken down and nonfunctional."
bad,"They were (and still are) very understaffed.  Those on the front end only got their lunch break, never the 2 fifteen minute breaks we were supposed to.  Pay was horrible for the customers you had to deal with."
bad,This place is a sinking ship. All they care about are warm bodies in the departments. They throw people out on the floor with very little knowledge after a few days of watching stupid videos. The don't pay for everything you have to put up with and management is so two faced.
bad,I was not satisfied with management or training. There was a severe lack of training which led to unsafe working conditions and practices. Management did not know enough to be of any help.
bad,"Hired me as a temporary employee. They count sick days against you, even when you have a doctor's note. I rarely get out of work on time anymore and then get yelled at for staying late. They are horrible to work with"
bad,"My experience has been that there is little communication between departments and levels of management. "
bad,"Management at Lowe's has gone downhill, they fix on the less important issues of the job. I love the people I work with but I don't enjoy my job anymore."
bad,"learned a lot. good working experience. fast pace, working with good employees who worked together. good working atmosphere. managers show and worked with me to get the job done right."
bad,"There is not much to say because if you know about retail you can sum up how it is to work at just about any store."
bad,This company is not worth the effort to apply to. It has very BAD money problems Chainwide. This is food for thought if anyone is thinking of applying..
bad,"I worked for them for over a year and was treated to the point that I did not feel comfortable going to any of the district managers, for the fact they all hung out together, if you talked to one behind closed doors, they all heard about. Store level was alright"
bad,management does not know how to do most jobs in the store. the scheduling makes it so you have no life at all. they will schedule you to close then open on a regular basis.
bad,"I have been with Lowe's for 2 1/2 years. I love the customers, I enjoy talking with them and helping them with their purchases. However, Lowe's Management chooses their favorite employees to advance in the company. A very unfair environment."
bad,When I started with Lowes in 2013 I was extremely excited. I liked Lowes as a company. Recently however Lowes has restructured its management. In doing so they have demonstrated disloyalty to their employees. They have lowered their base entry pay across the board. Basically they're following the wal-mart/home depot business plan.
bad,"Nothing special. Management played favorites, no real room to grow, low paying, was extremely hard to balance family and work with a sporadic work schedule. Basically just another customer service job."
bad,"They don't care about the girls up front on the registers,they get treated bad. Just know if you go in the that cashier had had a long unpleasant day."
bad,"My experience was not good because I worked in a department that required 3-5 associates in my department. However, there would normally be 2 and sometimes I would work by myself. I started out at 9/hr. and received a raise. However, when you don't have assistance stacking 300 pieces of lumber can become tiring."
bad,Ethicspoint is a joke. The company thrives on discrimination. Lacks diversity. if you have a complaint keep it to yourself or they will retaliate.
bad,a typical day at Lowes is being ready to go from the customer service desk then to lawn and garden registers then to pulling shopping carts.
bad,I would go to work and check customers out with their merchandise. I would stand in front of the register and waited for the customers to come. Management was okay and their were some nice co-workers to work with.  The hardest part was waiting for customers and getting hurt on the job. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers that came in a lot to get things.
bad,"‚Ä¢	Manage and maintain assigned Commercial customers"
bad,"Typical day at work is doing more than your pay grade while 15 million calls are being headed your way including customers and managers a like to do things that you cannot get to at the time because they already had you doing the other 14 million things. Your department managers are a joke and will usually be found in the breakroom or too busy walking around the store finding someone to chat with. The Assistant Store Managers and Store Managers do NOT keep you up to date with new policies and like to make up their own, and the policies the store actually has that you will try to follow the ASM's and SM will not back you up when it comes to a customer practically coming over the counter and calling you every name in the book. They do not care about your problems (not personal problems but actual business issues) they will brush you off or screen their calls and not answer their phones. Luckily though, some of your co-workers will make your day worth the struggle."
bad,A typical day at Lowes is not knowing what your job will that day or how many jobs will be included with the one you were originally hired to do. Management could care less especially store manager and HR. Lowes attitude is there is someone else that needs a job and if you can't do everything assigned we will hire someone else to take your place BUT WE WILL NOT HIRE OR STAFF THE DEPARTMENTS TO MATRIX....
bad,"Altho I love the challenge of any job that I have, and I try to find the best in any position, Lowes had to have been the worst place i have ever worked, from every aspect.  As much as they tried to preach safety, very rarely did I ever see it practiced.  Their equipment was very unsafe, out of hundreds of reach trucks, i may have driven possibly one or two that had complete wheels, the rest had chunks of material missing and while carrying a load the lift, what you were carrying, everything rocked and bounced.  The steering was horrible and extremely unsafe. Everything they had had leaks at either hydraulics, oil, water, ect, so the floor was constantly spotted and never cleaned.  Just the safety practice, or lack thereof, was horrible. No training at all.  They would not tell you what you were and were not allowed to carry or move, they just put you in a position and let you just do what you think is right, just to find out it was wrong, and never told until it was too late. All in all, and for me, just not a suitable workplace in any aspect."
bad,I come in and deal with  customers and help them whenever they need help. They pay and hours are bad and I've learned absolutely nothing. My co-workers are okay but the management is  not good. The hardest part of the job is taking advice from customers and listen to them complain about how much better Home Depot is.
bad,Wages are low and not supporting/ can't plain any activities or family events outside of work due to scheduled shifts and hours changing weekly.
bad,preparing the property for redeceration filling and rubbing walls and woodwork and repainting worked well with other painters and found it very rewarding when the property was finished
bad,maybe it was the store i worked for but i highly do not recommend that anyone works here! Management is rarely organized and often leave their work for other associates on the floor to do.
bad,"I meet a lot of people. ive learned a lot, management is managing. co workers are a blast. hardest part the people. best part the people."
bad,"Lowes in Evans very under staffed. Cashiers barely get breaks."
bad,"Poor management, under staffed, company cuts corners where ever they can to make money up to and including not getting proper paper towels to match paper towel dispensers. Worst company I've worked for yet. Loss prevention manager is almost non-existent and has weekends off on what would otherwise be the most statistically likely time for theft to happen and blames employees for products missing. It's all about the money for this company, anything else is irrelevant to them."
bad,"Didnt do much here at this company, but the workers are great."
bad,No respect for a hard worker you are just taken advantage of.  You get to watch lazy employees get away with doing nothing all day and if you just happen to be a good worker they will drive you into the ground and tell you it is still not enough. The scheduling sucks no work life balance at all and constant job cute lead to more work for minimum wage.
bad,This company will work you 10/8 hour shifts 7-9 days in a row . Weekends are supposed to rotate . But they don‚Äôt and people that are in with the managers good get the days they need off while everybody else gets requests denied even when putting in months ahead of time . Staff does not help fellow staff members and management does not care . was literally staying in the hospital sick and management used it against me saying doctors notes explain but do not excuse . I was in the HOSPITAL barely functioning!
bad,Not family focused like they claim. Understaffed and over worked  Management is clueless on what their job is and talks to associates like dogs. Company has gone down hill to work for the past few years.
bad,"I don't want to make it sound like this is an especially bad place to work. Its just especially not for me. I hate this stuff. I never want to do it again. Sorry if you have to, hopefully you like it better than me."
bad,"No Training, none past initial- Managers have NO CLUE how Specialists do their jobs!!! I literally could go on & on- do not settle for working at Lowe‚Äôs!!!"
bad,"Lowe's is a people mill.  If you hear of lay offs and concerns of losing your job in 1-2 years, it's true and I would highly consider this going in.  They pump people out, just as much as they pump people in.  "
bad,"The working culture is horrible.The store manager is disrespectful.Their‚Äôs no teamwork.Some Associate complain all day and every day.MST is not a real team .It is bias ,Some people get away with doing whatever they want or don‚Äôt want to do on the team .And management makes excuses for them And everything else .The rules are not the same for everyone.Some people are not treated fairly.But I am still optimistic that ü§îthings can change"
bad,They asked me to operate a forklift without a proper license because I had done a 30min exam in about 12min because they rushed me to finish. The person training me left after 3 days that I was there without warning to anyone and I had to learn on my own with no help. Then I was told by management to train the new employee with the little to no experience that I had. Poor job and would not recommend unless absolutely desperate.
bad,"All for them, none for us low level hourlys. No support from  management,  complete disconnect from corporate with store level operations. Overall environment is negative....you never know when your position could be eliminated."
bad,"I was hired has an casher for 11 to 7 Monday through friday.  Next was doing returns.  Some days you work 9 to 10 hours. With 8 day week weeks. When  was on floor there an was an lack of training ad knowledge. Some people very nice but upper management is not. "
bad,No communication. Unbelievably unreal expectations. Contsantly understaffed. Poor management. Never could understand how upper management made it into the positions they held. No work life balance. Pay is above average but not enough to deal with the daily struggles and stress of working for the company.
bad,It's a terrible place to work with terrible management. I was an MSA and we would receive a list of how to do our jobs every week and every week it would be different. My manager would fuss and write you up if you didn't reach your numbers while she sat at her desk playing on her phone or looking at social media. She never helped us or did anything. Then when we would finish our work she would tell us she needed to submit it as her own so that she could reach her numbers. Not fair at all.
bad,"This was the number one store in the region...new manager came in after closing his last store...30 employees short in six months, assistant managers quitting left and right...kept a lead in the garden center that ran non sellable up over 300,000 from 30,000 the prior year and the year isn‚Äôt up yet. Poor morale all stemming from that one manager, and new rules lost 15 more people"
bad,"Trying too hard to compete with Home Depot, it's changing the culture, making it an unpleasant place to work. Resulting in losing alot of good loyal employees."
bad,Honestly my experience with Lowes started out great however shortly after that the work life balance went out the window and I had a rude awakening about how they treat their management team. Most of the people there are amazing to work with however there are the select few that do not have your back.
bad,"No organization,no accountability.If your are not part of the clique you will get nowhere. It is a culture of tell on your coworkers and kiss the managers feet and you'll get along fine.If not your life will be a living nightmare."
bad,"Marginal managers completely ignore top company producers in favor of classic ""suck ups"".  Harass all minorities except Caucasian males who fear the successes of exceptional sales producers of color."
bad,"Corporate dictates every aspect of the store and they are doing a poor job. It used to be much better but now it‚Äôs all about upper management bonuses and reviews. The new CEO came from JCPenney and Home Depot and he seems to want Lowe‚Äôs to go in the same direction. We constantly copy Home Depot. The customer nor the employees matter, only sales. They cut back on employees each shift so the employee receives fewer hours and the customer gets no or poor service."
bad,"Poor management ,bad employee equality ,not organised  the store in bayonne nj is not well managed  bad when it comes to the pricing of items nothing is ever where its supposed to be  management doesnt treat the employees fairly at the store in bayonne"
bad,I‚Äôve been with Lowes for 3 years and it has been on a steady decline towrdes it‚Äôs employees when I started I had a set schedule 4-1 m-f which was perfect because my kids are off the bus at 3 well they recently decided to change that and even after promising me an overnight spot which it turned out the pay was going to be 2$ less an hour I got stuck with an 8-5 shift and on top of not getting to see my kids I would have to pay extra for daycare
bad,Just like all retail jobs. High turnover and little room for advancement. Management is figuratively treading water in hopes they dont get fired and employees are working multiple departments with little to no help. Severly understaffed. You might get breaks and a lunch and you might not.
bad,"Very articulate in requirements of protocol, not giving any kind of understanding on new changes, process requirements. No real leadership skills. Not willing to learn and understand from feedback from employees."
bad,"I would not go to work here, overwork you, way understaffed, management pushes you to do poor work against Lowes training videos! Management and the Lowes Culture is not good!"
bad,"Management favors individuals just like any where else however when compensation and promotion is directly related this promotes a negative work environment. When I was hired the store manager guaranteed Monday through Friday 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. with the opportunity for overtime. After 2 years was told mandatory overnights for several weeks one week overnight the next 6 a.m. and so forth with no pay differential. If this was not met told there would be no position available for me. All this after meeting all requirements the past two years such as traveling to other stores, overtime, and no write ups or disciplinary action. Lower management in charge of my department claims store manager never should have made such deal because she knew she wouldn't be able to honor it."
bad,"Loves my job but did not like being told I‚Äôm worthless, no good at my job , I can‚Äôt do anything right. If all that was true why would they give me a position that I was in charge of the front end and had to fixed mistake certain management did on the daily and there still there"
bad,"Lowe's, at first was a pretty decent job. People seemed friendly and started off as a pretty good place to work, but with corporate changes and layoffs, it became a nightmare. Managers stopped caring, HR department was eliminated altogether, and to top it off I was hired as seasonal but was never given a full-time position, and therefore never could qualify for benefits for a job that was so physically and mentally draining."
bad,Working at Lowe's is not good at the Danville va location. Management does not care about employee's only bottom line. Current store manager is a micro manager said he use to be a delivery driver but every time you try to tell him some thing he don't want to hear it
bad,Just a job not a career.  If it is not in writing don't believe it. You have to work more jobs than what you applied for. ASM managers not knowledgeable.  They hiring all the Home Depot rejects and copying their business
bad,"Bosses were unfriendly, uninformed,or didn't"" care.You could ask a pertinent question to your duties and be totally ignored, or given an answer that was totally unimformational,it didn't""t clarify anything."
bad,This used to be an amazing company to work. Those days are gone. Now it's about hiring cheaper (non professional) seasonal workers and selling cheaper and cheaper products. to.
bad,It is a company that keeps cutting back to the point of 1 person that now has to do 2-3 other jobs plus their own.  I felt very unsure about a long term careers due to the company constantly cutting back so many jobs all the time..I feel it is not a reliable company to work for and has no loyalty to the people who work their hardest there.
bad,"The store mgr is not engaged with his employees. Every mgr in the bldg was brought in from Home Depot. The existing mgrs that have tenure, are NEVER looked at for promotion. They are given the excuse that they must be successful running a large volume dept such as Outside Garden. The new mgrs from the other company have NO experience with a large volume dept. Favoritism is a huge problem with the open positions."
bad,During my employment at lowes I worked in different stores in different markets and no two stores are the same. the culture in the store definitely is set by the store manager and how he or she interacts with his or her associates.
bad,"I spent 14 years of my life at Lowe's.  In the beginning, it was good, I felt worthwhile and compensated.  By the end, I felt like all of my hard work meant nothing, and my failing health was a burden. You could not pay me any amount of money to return to Lowe's."
bad,"Management plays favorites and will alter your schedule randomly without telling you. Only a handful of people are actually expected to do any work, everyone else can go sit in their cars or the break room for hours while management plays on their phones or hide in the manager's office."
bad,"Ive been with Lowe's for about 3 yrs. Ive seen so many people come and go. First of all lets go back to when i started. I became a load puller. I worked part time making 12.65 hr. Got a raise after my one yr, went to 12.85 per hr. I saw an opening for full time delivery helper, got the job without an interview. Went from 12.85 to 11.66. . Doing deliveries is more dangerous then being in the store. "
bad,"Everyone feels like they are on the chopping block, there are more cliques in Lowe's then in a high school, nepotism is the name of the game with this company, short term bandages are put in place to run up stock price but no long term solutions are sought, systems are antique and do not work well or sometimes at all with each other, you will be talked down to daily, retaliation is a hobby for the management team in my store, somehow two people on our are capped on pay....same job, same title the guy makes more, ah yes and if you do happen to find a job you enjoy then be prepared to never see a raise again bc they cap pay to help push tenured employees out the door, if you plan on working here be advised to have the number to a good attorney on hand."
bad,I did not receive help from anyone. Management was not helpful with anything. Management did no work. All I learned was how to properly cut wood. Enjoyed interacting with customers.
bad,"As a delivery driver, it's beneficial to be given the correct tools and well maintained straps for carrying heavy appliances. Well, management here thinks the exact opposite. Not to mention they have sent me out on deliveries for more than 10 hours behind the wheel which violates DOT laws and not to mention you don't get breaks."
bad,Management controls all options for advancement.  Personality counts more than qualifications for any advancement.  Hours are inconsistent and self training is needed to perform job duties.
bad,Managers don't support the associates who work on the floor. They hide in back offices and think helping actual customers is not their job.  They don't care at all if other employees are overwhelmed and they understaff the store then refuse to help. The full time rotation offers zero work/life balance.
bad,This location was poorly run and very much under staffed. I am so ready to leave this place. If you like bs and managers continue to undermine each other. Then this is the place for you.
bad,"Management cuts hours a lot, however the job is low stress and pretty relaxed. Pay could be better, and communication definitely needs improvement. Nobody is held accountable for their own job. Management plays favorites."
bad,Lowe's will be a good job to work at if there was team work. It's stressful and hard work. I'm always by myself behind customer service. I can handle it with no problem it was just be nice to have help. Some co-workers just leave with out cleaning up and I will have to clean it for them. Lowe's can be better if people who work there actually care about other people. Mangerment is really poor there.
bad,"LOWE'S is a classic example of corporate greed in America. Always understaffed, wages are low, you do not get a set schedule. People and family do not matter to this company. However, the employees are great and loyal. It's a shame Lowe's is a profit before people attitude and customers are NOT first. It's all smoke and mirrors."
bad,"Lowe's as a company and what they offer is a very good place to shop, with well informed employees who offer very good customer service. On the other hand working there is a completely different thing. Employees are treated like cogs in a system that are replaceable. Management is rude and impersonal, management often lack people skills. Employees are often expected to perform task intended for more than one individuals by themselves which honestly creates an unsafe work environment. You are often expected to do more than your job description requires with no extra compensation, its a place of backbreaking work with little compensation. "
bad,"Lowe's is a culture of nepotism, imagine a family run company that only hired their neighbors from the farm and finds itself a 56 billion dollar company that retains its backwoods values.  If you are from Wilkesboro and had family who were already with the company you are guaranteed a job. Lowes values Loyalty above all else, anything they say on their PR page is a falsehood.  This has been the only company that I have been part of that penalizes you for having earned a degree above an associate level.  If you worked as a cashier and worked your way up the chain then you are management material. If you are hired externally to help change the systematic cycle of failure then you will find yourself in a world of frustration. A Wilkesboro native with a high school education will put in charge of employees with advanced degrees in their fields because they are ""Lowe's Savy"" or in non Lowe's terms, they know a family member or neighbor to work the system.  Corporate is by far a very political and toxic environment that penalizes success. You are encouraged to document why a program or project failed than to show improvement. Lowe's does not accept change, the former CEO ruled by decree that ""He wanted to see his DNA on everything at Lowe's"". Gross as that sounds, he wanted his decrees to be gospel handed down the management chains without question.  Lowe's also is happy to trap employees who accept a moving package to work at corporate. It is known as the 2 or 3 year bounce where depending on your relocation package you find yourself 40k or more on the hook to stay for an allotted"
bad,The pay was so low that you could not afford to live. The company could not retain employees including upper management. Employees were stretched so thin through the store that it appeared that there was no one to help. Employees could not keep up covering multiple departments throughout the store. Staff changed so frequently that we lacked a knowledgeable staff. Mental breakdowns were frequent (Ambulances were called several times while I worked there). An overall nightmare of a place to work. The company refused to give adequate compensation (many were making less than fast a fast food restaurant).
bad,"I worked here for a couple years now. The place seems to get worse every month I was there. "
bad,"This job was good at first!  Once I was able to get out of training, that's when I realized what really was going on.  This job was lead by a maleficent plant manager that really had no concerns for the people and their safety.  It took a year from me and all I got was a hey we heard what you had to say now get back to work.  There where times that the conditions of the building where so poor.  It seems that no one there cares about people unless they are friends and family.  They have no concerns to want to truly do their job, and if you are a good worker, it's only made worse due to the fact that all the work will be placed on you and with no remorse!  I think that this is just this location though.  I would work there again if the management would change and people would pay attention and do their assigned jobs as per contract they signed to do!"
bad,Pay is not great they overwork you and they choose who gets a decent raise or they‚Äôll just give you a .30 cent raise. It‚Äôs not a company I recommend for fair pay.
bad,"no accountability, although i feel i was paid fairly, i did not feel like i was doing enough work for the wage i was earning and because of this, i felt very disposable. especially when i was seeing quality associates getting fired left and right. the training was an absolute joke, and when questions were asked, instead of getting help, id get attitude."
bad,"I started at lowe's in 2007, I knew people who worked for the company much longer. The company, as far as the employees are concerned, has been going downhill since 2010? (give or take a year) They all agree. Lowes has become more stock holder driven than employee. It is not a good company to work for anymore. I really thought this would be my last job, I said so in my initial interview. This is the reason I got the position I did. I really did love the job in the beginning. I'm sad that I had to leave, but they have seriously changed who they are."
bad,"Lowes has a very poor dress code. , All employee needs to dress professionally.  This does not happen at Lowes. I was very disappointed in the dress code, and lack of training to perform your job.  One should not have to ask questions because of being trained well.   Some employees were trained longer for the same jobs. Many supervisors were not professional.  Everything that makes a good employee has not been covered n the training."
bad,"Management promised advancement and job opportunities. Lies. The managers are not leaders, they are bosses. Everyone believe that they are entitled to being treated with respect, regardless of their actual performance. No one takes their job seriously. It is like being in High School but for grown ups."
bad,"Best thing about this job were my co workers.  The Lowes I worked at had a lot of great, friendly, good people working there. They kept the place running in-spite of the managerial ineptitude."
bad,Very unprofessional Management. They use tactics that are unjustly called for to keep a edge over one another. There is no team work among them they are always hiding from customers and can't maintain the store without the store manager on the premises.
bad,well are job on paper was to replenish all retail stock but the unloaders couldn't complete their job on time so we would be able to complete our jobs so we ended doing both which always put our crew behind and caused my discontent!!
bad,"Management is ridiculous here. No one knows what they are doing, and everyone just goes in circles. They do not care about their employees whatsoever."
bad,Worked at Lowe‚Äôs believing the things boasted about by the managers.  But working there soon became a pain and there was little room for advancement.  I do not recommend working there.
bad,"This isn't a bad company if you like to get your hours in for a decent pay. My experience just wasn't the best. Manager at the location I was at made you feel you couldn't come to him with any problems that you had with co-workers. They weren't strict about their guidelines and policies, co-workers often slacked around even after being corrected. So all in all. Lowe's as a company isn't bad, just study the location before you apply."
bad,"Management sucks, don‚Äôt know how to mange a schedule AT ALL, to many people telling you what to do. Don‚Äôt get the job you applied for half the time. Don‚Äôt know how to mange your schedule with your preferred time."
bad,"Management would rather hire full time employees from outside the store than to give the current employees that are always there a chance at full time. Management has a clique and make it known if you are part of that clique or not. Managment will lie straight to your face than tell you the truth. They use the good workers and work them hard and let the loudest and lazy workers have the easy work. If you go above the store management and call corporate, they fire you."
bad,place would be great to work but they only focus on making money not working with you for time off make you work most weekends hard to get good hours change your schedule with out telling you
bad,"The management and HR are terrible!!!!! And the scheduling there is even worse , they don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre in school. They need you at work at all tin"
bad,I worked at Lowes in 2014 as a seasonal employee for 6 months and the week after I was let go for low volume business I received my benefits package in the mail. Lowes needs to get it together.
bad,"Working seasonally is a nightmare, they start you out with two fourty hour weeks then cut you done to 8 hours aday. Seasonal employees are treated awfully by regular works most of which refuse to train season associates. Lowes also forces employees to work off the clock during breaks if no one can cover them"
bad,"I was told when hired mininum lifting several months into the job, I was required to lift heavy objects and was given no options. I was refused another position in the store. There is a lot of gossip and backbiting not only from co-workers but also management."
bad,"Benefits where constantly cut from the employees every year. Lowe's had transitioned from more full time associates to more part time associates, so the quality of knowledge and work ethic became non existent."
bad,The work environment has been frustrating as it is difficult to sometimes find a member of management to help you when you need assistance.  The work load among the employees is extremely imbalanced.
bad,"Stressful place to work, good old boys club.  Constant layoffs of older workers.  People undermine each other including managers.Too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
bad,Great people work here and people looking for a paycheck. Plan on doing other people's work as well as your own. No advancement unless you move out of your store. No matter how great of an employee you are.
bad,Horrible inconsistency.. 6 am 10...cashiers have to clean bathrooms yuk!!#if your late shift...sweep mop..empty trash clean break room.....it was üëénothing else to say!!!#####
bad,"The job was pretty simple , just helping customers when needed. Work was hot since it was all outside in the summer. Loaded trucks with mulch, rocks, blocks, among other things. Watered flowers and stocked shelves. Management wasn't too Great but for the most part it was an ok temporary job."
bad,Worked for Lowe's for a Year & half got prompted twice no pay raise i was making 10.49 left for two months came back they offered me 10.75 -favoritism
bad,"Do NOT try to impress management because it will get you no recognition for the extra time or hard work you put into it. Also, when you are hired on, they say that "" It is easy for you to ""move up the ladder"" in this company"", but that is a bold face lie! Been working there over 6 months and have more knowledge of the job than the rest of my peers & yet I still am treated like a newborn."
bad,Its just a dead end low paying job that the turn over rate is through the roof and no one wants to stay there. You would be lucky to go 6 months with out getting new managers or co workers.
bad,"This was a deceiving place to work just because they told me I was part time and end up letting me go three months later telling me I was only temporary... the manager sexually harassed me and there was nothing I can do about it, people very judgmental.. Didn't feel comfortable."
bad,Working at lowes was very stressful and unfairly paid.  They expected more and more and more but would not compensate you for the work you did.  Had a poor management team and was not worth the hassle.
bad,to work there you have to know ppl to get up higher and it a place to wor for if you want to feel like you wast your time a lot and if you do not want to feel like you a give a dam about
bad,"Ever since the new Corporate restructure back in Feb of 2017, those that were ""promoted"" to service manager were promised a 5% increase in pay for the new responsibilites.  Behold, we were given at most 3% and that included the yearly increase as well.  Upper management only finds issues with who they pick and choose to find issues with, and don't let them find out that you are applying to another location because they will find a reason to get rid of you.  Also many of the male managers are extremely sexist."
bad,"Do you want to work a horrible rotating schedule in a place where it's every man for himself? Welcome to Lowe's where you are totally expendable - and treated as such! Be prepared for anything/everything to be skewed in the favor of this selfish second-rate corporation. A few good people still work here, but with unrealistic sales objectives, tons of turnover and terrible management in place, this store's multiple issues are guaranteed to make you miserable."
bad,"I enjoyed the client/customer experience, but because management did not support the needed GC support and the compensation outline was not consistent."
bad,"Assist customers with their electrical issues"
bad,Get paid 11 to build grills all day while the sales flood stands around and waits for people to talk to them and gets paid more than I do. Broken system if you ask me.
bad,"Was not getting what was agreed to me before being hired did not tell me I would be counted against. When I had to be at school. The co-workers I had were pleasant to be around but even telling me to leave and that this place was""t great that was a no for me"
bad,"Great place if you have good management.....really BAD if your stuck in a store/district that is still on the ""good old boy system"". "
bad,It is a good place to start off. If you're looking for advancement this is not the place. Majority seasonal employees so after the Spring and Summer they are cut.
bad,This place was a joke!  Management was never available and always yelled at employees for not meeting sales goals while they would sit in their office.  Not a good work environment!
bad,Managers were fired or demoted often. We never knew who we were going to report to on a day by day basis. I do not know if every store is run like the one in Inverness but employees were not valued assets.
bad,"There just wasn't any Godliness in that place, It was filled with nothing but negativity."
bad,"The location that I worked for was very unwelcoming. Though the videos seemed like the environment would be very positive and uplifting, the actual store was far from that. I wish I did more research before investing my time into it."
bad,Large lack of training for Managers. Tough to get days off. Not employee oriented unless it benefits the management. Management takes favoritism to new highs.
bad,They are trying to get rid of all full time employment first it started with management and now they are looking at specialist. Currently morale‚Äã is low and employees are on edge and discouraged because job security is not something anyone at Lowe's currently has. But if you're interested in part time employment have at it.
bad,"I have nothing to say. It was a horrible place to work mainly due to the management team. General manager, Human resources person and head cashier. "
bad,"It's retail. What do you expect.  Management would show favoritism to people they liked and made work life horrible to those they didn't ""Favor"". "
bad,"They don't pay very well and if you expect your co-workers to help you in the daily tasks then you expect too much. Since they don't pay well they don't get good employees so the ones they do have that are worth having end up seeking other employment."
bad,Very stressful environment.  Problems are not resolved and huge favoritism playing.   If you cannot handle high amounts of stress and poor attitude from co workers I do not recommend working there.  No team work either.
bad,I dont think ill go back cause the mangement is not right. If I could would change the store manger it was fun when I started. I feel as if he is very rude.
bad,very poor management first day i was put to train with a person who had just started the day before with no manager to guide
bad,"Management doesnt know what they are doing,even though they think they do.all they care about is that bonus.they try to run their drivers to the ground until they quit.this store has a high turn over rate with drivers.they dont keep the fleet of trucks current on any maintenance,so thats a hazard on its own.this place is filled with the ""good ol boy system"".anyone that works here or wants to,good luck."
bad,"Lowe's is not too great, but it is a job"
bad,Does not have the right people in the right positions. The main boss lies to your face. Been called out and he hates to be called out when he is wrong.
bad,"The customers and what I do at Lowe's is a lot of fun, but is ruined by the nasty women coworkers. They don't work and spend their time gossiping. If you go against them or ask them to work, you get shunned and they make your time there miserable. Management ""plays favorites"" because its easier to let them do what they want rather than put them straight. I've also been there over a year and haven't been promoted to full-time despite being a better worker than most."
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had. Unfortunately, the managers working here are grossly uneducated and rule with fear and intimidation."
bad,"I was hired on as a seasonal cashier a couple of years ago. I quit right before the season ended as it was miserable. When I first began I was offered what seemed like a really good hourly wage for a cashier. Then I realized how poor the conditions were and that in reality the hourly wage didn't even come close to the compensation I would expect to put up with working conditions."
bad,Everyone is very knowledgeable of their department and work really well. Can get really busy at times when not a lot of people are scheduled.
bad,I enjoyed my time there but not a lot of room for progress or promotion with the corporation. Although it was great experience to learn about home improvement and further my knowledge of home improvement.
bad,Enjoy working here. but our store needs improvement with keeping the hard working employees there. they rather hire part time people instead of keep on the ones that work full time. to many employment turn overs.
bad,Fast paced frantic pace with overbearing managers. Very sketch coworkers and as few benefits as legally possible. They give half hour unpaid lunch breaks with small discounts for food.
bad,"Job was temporary as a seasonal sales associate.  Managers were unprofessional in how they handled issues with customers.  For example, a customer asked to speak to a manager to make a special order.  The manager had been paged on the intercom several times.  The customer was patient enough to wait approximately 20 minutes before asking for the corporate number to complain about the management while making a good remarks about me for the assistance."
bad,"It started out nice enough but quickly I learned that in addition to not having a chance for a real full-time job with benefits, the full time workers do even less than we do.  The management just looks the other way while we do the department heads jobs for them."
bad,"I started with a lot of expectations, but the more I worked there, the more I wanted to leave. Like everywhere else, there were good and bad coworkers. Management was poor with a lot of changes. The hardest part of the job was working with rude customers and trying to keep giving great customer service. On hand training wasn't great. There were a lot of details supervisors forgot to teach new employees. There was not enough personnel in some departments for such a big store, this made it difficult to provide efficient customer service. My experience overall was disappointing and I would not go back to Lowe's. If you are looking just for a job, go ahead. If you are in search of career advancement, save your time and go somewhere else. On another note, all Lowe's have received notification from corporate to hire droves and droves of ""part-time"" employees only. If you are looking for part-time work then this may be a great place for you, but DO NOT expect to have a full time position. Lowe's doesn't want to take a chance and have to pay for benefits for, good, full time workers."
bad,"Recently, hours were cut terribly and all of us have suffered.  Calling for assistance from other departments is hit or miss.  Lack of staff is a frequent issue.  Constant call outs and no one available to fill these positions.  "
bad,"Cashed out customers,also helped out at the paint dept.Watered the plants in the garden center.When the employee was out on vacation stood in for her as a price changer."
bad,"no one knew schedules. the efficiency wasn't very good. task that were asked to do didn't make sense in the way they were done, goes back to efficiency"
bad,the workers were easy to talk to but the management was terrible. they were difficult to talk to and refused to hear anybody out.i wouldnt recommend
bad,This job was full time seasonal and I enjoyed working with and helping store customers.
bad,"Lowes is basically what you make of it, management is not very supportive and you feel like just a number."
bad,"joined in a management store management training program, this was a HUGE mistake. Perhaps if I had no experience and this was a first job, it would have been OK. But for an experienced person this was a degrading and humiliating experience. The program was sold as a ‚Äúfuture leadership‚Äù program - totally incorporate.  This was a poorly organized program to gain MBA experience at the store management level with no possibility of career advancement and an MBA is totally over qualified and undervalued for this this role."
bad,"I applied for the class A CDL job and got hired,shortly after 6 months I was forced out of my position to become a box truck driver. Reason being another driver hired after me said  he couldn't do the box truck driving position anymore because of prior back surgery. What a mess this became for me. I got screwed plain and simple. I would never recommend working for this position.All the upper Management were a click whom took sides with each other and didn't believe non management employees. I was wrongfully terminated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Working for Lowe's would never happen again for me. I did not enjoy the management and favourtism was highly played. Management seemed to not care about any employees, and had something bad to say about an employee on a daily basis."
bad,Management has no clue. Pay sucks. To get a permant position must know someone really well. Qualifications don't mean a thing.
bad,The job is great but management won't take care of day to day problems. They let bad employees stay for years. So i have come to the realization that they really don't care as long as the work gets done. When you try to move up they will put a person who has no knowledge of the department or of the product in charge.So the trem lets build something together does not applu to your carrier.
bad,"Great place to work,everyone's so friendly and nice,management is some of the most top notch professionals that I have ever had a chance to work with."
bad,While working the register I was also responsible for answering the phones and helping customers sign up for the Lowe's credit card. I was also responsible for making sure that the other cashiers were getting their brakes and lunches. Occasionally I would have to handle returns and customer escalations.
bad,"When I first started with Lowes, it was really was a great company. I enjoy going to work and looked forward to making a career out of it. Over time as the older CEO's started retiring and the new ones started taking over I watched it go down hill. No longer do they give bonuses or sales incentives to their employees. I have also witnessed upper management bullying, alienating and retaliate against people they do not like. HR is just as bad, many issues that are addressed with them in confidence usually ends up getting you alienated. I have worked in three different stores, my fist store was awesome. The managers were great and helpful and led by example, they also really taught me a lot. My second store was a complete joke, there was no sense of unity between co-workers, everyone hated each other and the store manager was by far one of the most corrupt individuals I have ever had to work for. Half the time he was on his phone texting instead of helping customers or employees, he was never on time and possessed a tendency to let his favorites do whatever they wanted. My third store started out great, I was sent there to help fix issues. Things seemed to go ok until I started objecting to breaking rules and policies to cheat other employees and customers. That was just the tip of the iceberg, once corporate came in no employee would say what was really going on due to what would happen to them after corporate left. The upper management was by far the worst group of managers any company could ask for aside from one. As sad as it is to say but Lowes just isn't the company it used"
bad,There were very few opportunities unless you are a full time employee.
bad,"A typical day at Lowes depending on your position is primarily about customer service and product knowledge.  I learned a vast array of information about the products and their implementation there.  The Asst. store managers where fantastic especially my zone manager in particular, however the frequent changes in store managers made it very difficult for the rest of the store to maintain a quality standard.  The co-workers were very immature, kinda like high school but worse, they were definitely the hardest part of the job.  There were a select few that were great but overall they seemed very disengaged and merely only showed up for a paycheck and to gossip which I thought was a tragic shame.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I had a wonderful zone manager that I could depend on in all situations that could've arose.  "
bad,"It was a good part time job for a retiree for a while. It seems"
bad,"Management was horrible. Did not care that you had needs such as water breaks when working in the sun all day and would often leave me alone out in the garden dept. with a line of customers. Many times I didn't get a break. Was expected to water plants and clean area alone with customers around. I and other cashiers were often told to stay at the registers in the pouring rain and during storms. Also was expected to move plant carts (weighing 50 plus lbs) and load bags of mulch and soil with a broken wrist. Was never allowed to sit down. Witnessed employee stealing money and management let her off the hook. Was expected to stay hours after store closed until everything was clean. Was also told to help customers find things when I first started and didn't know where items were. Supervisor tried to get involved with my personal life and preached at me. Was expected to work 4 hour shifts when I lived almost an hour away. Had to look at 3 different schedules and try to figure out when to come in. Had no lifeoutside of this job. If they called me in for a shift and I couldn't come in immediately or not at all, I was yelled at. Never again will I wprk or shop here. Too much drama. "
bad,"Everyday dealing with idiot customers, I learned that everyone should work in retail to better respect the salesman. Managers were overall incompentent self centered legends in their own mind. Co-workers are self centered. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who have no idea the different between what they want and what they really need. Made some good friends, made some good relations with some of the customers. Best part of the job was GOING HOME...."
bad,"Plenty of work to be done during a shift. Learned not to express intelligent concerns about daily operations because it is their way or the highway. Management, some were very nice and understanding,others well nothing nice to say. Most of my co-workers wanted to stand around and talk instead of doing something worth while or would just disappear to the break room for hours to pass the time. Hardest part; being under staffed and expected to produce, being left alone with little or no training or help.Couldn't trust anyone you work with. Best part; Helping customers by selling them the right products or arming them with info to do their projects correctly. See people come in unhappy and then leaving with a smile."
bad,I enjoyed helping people and explaining projects to them.you probably walk some mileage while working.
bad,nothing enjoyable. no help and the management didnt have open conversations alot of people out of place.
bad,"I loved my job. Within the first few days I was even given a customer service award. My coworkers for the most part were incredible and I could not ask for anything better. However, the managers had absolutely no idea what they were doing. Us loaders did the job of about 15 or so employee's while the others were told by the higher ups to stick to their stations. A typical day would be me and one other loader responsible for the entire store. Clearing all of the carts, putting everything away and then loading anything a customer needed into their car which sometimes was unbelievably physically taxing. I am not complaining about the physicality as much since I am capable of handling it but over time it wears down even the strongest of people. My back had given out one day and I was bed-ridden for a week. Upon coming back to work I was given light duty just handling the registers but within 40 minutes they had me working like a mule again by the end of the day my back had given out again. I would have loved to continue working there but if the managers abuse their workers to the point of breaking there is no way of keeping a sane work environment."
bad,"The job is fine, no real complaints. The work tends to be more than anyone can handle, and the compensation is unbalanced."
bad,"My tyical day at lowes is that I go in stock freight, help customers. I learned a lowes that there is not much opprotutinty to grow with the company. Also that management comes and go's. My coworkers are great people to work with. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you still have one tommrrow. What I enjoyed most is that we used to work for a company that cared. And its not the same anymore."
bad,"Hired for a sales position, ended up stocking shelves and getting shopping carts all day. No Benefits, schedule changes all over the place and HS dropouts for managers."
bad,"The work is a great condition environment, but the management was always at an unaccepatable level. the promotions was thru the ""good ol boy"" program."
bad,"The only good thing about this company is that they start you off with a good amount of pay and you get to meet new people. If you want to go to school part time and work...It's not happening. They wont approve your schedule, they schedule crazy hours. They will cut back on your hours and randomly call you in and then get mad when you can't come in. The managers do not know how to do simple things like the register or how to refund things etc. So when there is extra help needed you cannot depend on them. The managers act as though it is the regular associates against them, two separate teams. Lowes is a company where you can do certain favors to find your way to the top.There is an associate that is having relations with the hr and got promoted to an assistant manager"
bad,"They make you work up to 9 days in a row and don't pay any Overtime. You close the Store one night at 11 and 8 hours later, you are on duty again. No sitting allowed. Worked in Garden and wasn't even allowed bottled water without a DR note. On hard concrete all day long and the Store is so big it can't keep cool in the heat or warm in the Winter. They work you 39 hours a week..never 40 or you get in trouble. All Management Staff are required to work 60-70 hours a week ( HR is 55 ) and they break with you so there is no chance to complain about them to each other and if you do, you are disciplined harshly. Management is Ridiculous...more like Drill Sgts. I hated working there..oh yeah, in the Garden area they want you to chuck the nests that the birds make, chicks and all! I am NOT kidding! They also like to hire young people and train them their way...more like brainwash them...and give them added responsibilities and pay and before they know it, they are 35 and have no Education and are stuck! When they figure it out, Lowe's removes them and keeps the money wheel turning! Also, be prepared to cheer...yes, actually cheer...for LOWE'S every shift! Arg!"
bad,Seems like managment doesnt care about how hard you work.
bad,There was now way to advance unless you were connected with the bosses.
bad,"Working here is enjoyable if you don't mind much about fair pay and don't want to move any further up than your entry level. Managers are hired outside the company and the starting pay is never consistent for new hires no matter your experience, you could be there for a year as full-time and make less than a part time does on their first day."
bad,"The company at corporate and store level is focused on customer ratings, sales and reduction of payroll.  The work/life balance they speak of is non-existent. Managers make promises they do not keep. Most managers have little to no human resource understanding and very little patience or concern when an employee asks for or needs assistance.  Training is pitiful in both time and content.  Employees are expected to train themselves with no direction and outdated to few resources. There are numerous employees with valuable talent and skill that is either ignored or constricted. A few years ago, Lowes was a great place to work and employees thrived. Today it is a perfect example of how to destroy workplace motivation and productivity."
bad,Lowe's is a awful place to work the managers do not care about their employees they feel like you can be replaced at any time and that is a bad mind frame to have they will tell you one thing and do another I have seen coworkers get terminated based off of Lies you can have a witness and they would never ask them terrible terrible place to work
bad,Favoritism runs rampant. Those that show dedication to do a good job get piled on while those w little to no work ethic are NEVER held accountable.  They don‚Äôt want employee feedback and don‚Äôt respect any ideas offered.  Poor communication. Hire cheap help rather than skilled help (at customers cost).   Inventory and prices are often incorrect and associates are at wits end.
bad,P/T employees treated as less than average employee. No discussions of advancement opportunities.  No emphasis on training. Most employees needing only to look out for themselves.
bad,"No job security at all. Your position can be eliminated with no notice "
bad,"Lowe's is introducing pay cuts and added expectations to sales specialists, resulting in a tense environment.  Weak management must communicate this change, which makes it even worse."
bad,"I would discourage anyone from inquiring about working there from someone that is just giddy to have a job.  1st question would be, how long have your worked there.  "
bad,"Unfair to employees, horrible schedules, awful managers.   Everything about the working conditions were bad.  HR never took your side on any matter so they were useless"
bad,"This job sucks and management is terrible. The entire front of the store is considered to be the head cashier's responsibility. So, even when you need help with customer issues or employee issues, be prepared to deal with it alone."
bad,If the  Executive Leadership remains in place over the next 3-5 years then the company should experience a stable work environment. The technology team does not have a true purpose or identify.
bad,"The company as whole continuously goes through changes year to year in terms of management.  Sometimes as often as twice a year.  Lowe's tends to shadow or emulate whatever Home Depot does in order to survive.  The quality of the company seems to be on the decline and heading down the same path as Sears because of significant cuts across the board with management.  You have a strained supervisory presence and rapport with employees as you have department managers covering four to five departments often not responding to customer service inquiries, and often will experience issues with managements expectations that employees perform more of their responsibilities at a significantly lesser rate of pay all of which contribute to a higher turnover rate.  This is a key factor in most full-time and part-time employees being dissatisfied with their jobs at Lowe's.  To that note most of your full-time employees in appliances, cabinetry, or their Pro Desk each have to make sales goals of $60,000 to over $100,000+  per month they must sell in order to remain employed, only to be rewarded with nachos or ice cream while management is paid several thousand dollars in bonuses per quarter.   If this sounds like a great company to work you should apply right away."
bad,The company has changed a lot over the years. In the beginning they took care of the employees. That is gone. A lot of the employees that have been there for years are beginning to leave
bad,"The work isn't hard. The pay isn't bad. But some of the rules make no sense and the culture is terrible. Because it's mostly college students, people are always complaining over nothing."
bad,"Head cashier won't listen to your problem. Have their own way or no way. Store sucks in TOMS RIVER, NEW JERSEY. Enjoyable part of day is lunch and break...."
bad,Unless you're willing to relocate which that comes up pretty often I wouldn't recommend. There are plenty of delivery positions out there that pay way more that do not ask you to relocate. You don't know what's going on with your day today it's constantly changing.. which can be frustrating due to poor routing and scheduling
bad,"Old boys club with new players. Bad top level managers, bad communication, no help to those in the seat. If you get a good manager. They will move you around... then back to someone not well trained or they just don‚Äôt care.  Everyone always looking to move to another dept. but other depts want to hire from outside. They do not promote from within, they hire outside."
bad,As the company keeps changing you have employees that have been there many years losing their jobs. They are restructuring and just getting rid of people and jobs.
bad,"I‚Äôve been with Lowes for nine years and in those nine years I‚Äôve seen lots of change. Since Marvin, the new CEO took over, he has made drastic changes that generally only include certain class of people, or benefit the shareholders. He did away with having two days off together, no weekends off, no commission or spiff or incentives. He plainly said, ‚Äúwe need to make the shareholders Happy‚Äù."
bad,"Always having to make excuses for why management is nowhere to be found. You have to wait minutes for code ones to be answered when there are managers in the store. Work hours have changed for Specialists to where they can work up to ten hours a day. No home/work life balance anymore. Not compensated for the work being added to our plate. NO COMMUNICATION with management. It is do as I say and do it now. Don't ask questions and no explaining for what, why, when. NEVER see the ASM over the department unless there is something that needs to be said to one of us. Answering the phone from another manager is more important than talking to the employee standing in front of you. FAVORITISM..... MORALE has gone downhill. Was told I was in for the management training over two years ago by two different department managers. Haven't heard anything since. Not the same company or store it was when I started 6 years ago."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. Management always looking out for themselves. It is THE WORST company I have ever worked for. For the job and responsibility, by far the worst in the industry. While they claim to appreciate you, they refuse to meet today's standards in how they treat you. Your just a body to them, nothing more"
bad,"I was disappointed in my experience at Lowes.  Management did a terrible job supporting employees in my department.  I have been a manager for another national chain so I am aware of the challenge.  But, there were somethings that could and should have been addressed.  Some issues with employees were extremally surprising as to how upper management ""handled"" it.  Looking the other way is how people get hurt and it is not a good business model or ethic. "
bad,Lowes as a company has changed for the worst. The new motto is do MORE with LESS. Also upper management can care less about employees!!! NO FAMILY VALUES!!!
bad,Lowe's has many great qualities that it can provide but it also has many more downfalls in the structure that it currently has. I would do many things to change how the environment is set-up and provide a better working place for the employees.
bad,Don‚Äôt work at Lowes unless you want to throw your life away. The job is emotionally draining and I don‚Äôt recommend it unless you are desperate Lowes is not it
bad,"The shift changes were crazy. One shift close the store and the next day open the store. Long shifts with out being able to use a restroom. When I would ask, they would always tell me to wait until they could get me covered. That could be an hour after I asked. When I got hurt, one front end person helped, but then they told me I couldn't leave to get medical help. I didn't enjoy working there."
bad,"Layoffs and terrible management. Sucks just like any other retail job, but things keep getting worse as time goes on. Job security is non existent and all stores are chronically understaffed"
bad,"I liked my job until management decided to not only change my schedule without [consulting me] but also my position! I happened to find out when putting in vacay time! When questioned, direct management only made excuses and said ""they dropped the ball""! Then they scheduled me every weekend in the month of October. My previous schedule had every other weekend off. Did I mention I found out my new schedule 3 days before it was to take effect and several weeks before the Company as a whole changes/changed all full time employees."
bad,Just dont work there if you do you will regret it.poor mangement poor workers .horrid working conditions not enough employees at work for job dutys keep asking for more pay less
bad,"They cleaned house over the summer & even got rid of the nice HR lady. Everyone was replaced by ppl who have an ugly heart.They have attitude & on open house career day, one of them was making ugly statements about the ppl who were seriously looking for work.She was laughing & making fun of how ppl dressed or looked.She interviewed some & later threw their paperwork away in garbage can"
bad,"Raises are minimum  & over night supervisors  are the worst, they will work you from the time you get in till you leave  & when its time to leave you have to get permission to leave."
bad,With recent company changes Lowes is going to be a hard company to get behind. Lowes use to be a company the valued the home life and work balance. It no longer does.
bad,"Management not the best,"
bad,There was no training. I was put into a department I knew nothing about. The people are not happy there.  I could not stand how negative the environment was at this store.
bad,"You may get a quarterly bonus for $3 or a pizza party for selling your soul. It's cool until day 30 , then you see why people hate it there. Inconsistency at its finest, your schedule will be whatever they want which is awful. Customers get away with ANYTHING and EVERYTHING and will treat you like absolute dirt ( this why I quit along with the bs they feed you). Lots of lies. They will tell you what you want to hear and totally do the opposite."
bad,"Lots of empty promises. Was here for a short time, nice customers and co-workers, but a company that you cannot make a living salary off of. Came from a plumbing background, and even with 5 years in the field, there was no benefit to working here. Unrealistic expectations from management, understaffed, underpaid, what more do I say? Have fun with a 30 cent raise a year (which most people don't even get)"
bad,"It took an entire month for me to finish the hiring process.. and I‚Äôve never regretted working somewhere so badly in my life. If you have other opportunities, take them before you settle for Lowes."
bad,"This job was okay, but I probably would not want to work at another Lowes after this job. The management was so-so, some managers were better than others, they had a habit of ""forgetting"" you're availability, too many people do nothing, but don't get in trouble because they are friends with the managers, lots of gossip as if it were a highschool, and Ironically it comes from mostly older employees who should know better at their age. Since there is technically no back room to store stuff, they put all access products on the very top shelves of their respective departments, except they don't and place them randomly sometimes throughout the store and don't tell you if they ran out of room and had to put it in a different department, which department it's in, and where to find it in that department."
bad,Not a union ized company they dont value there employees cashier rarely get any benefits even when you work full time hours. So many people quit in the last year its unbelievable
bad,So at least there‚Äôs that. Management is either good or sucks like any other retail and like all retails they expect you to do more than your job and more than you‚Äôre paid for.
bad,"It's retail, so a lot will depend on your store, district, and customer base. Starting out as a sales associate. I had fun, paid well, and enjoyed work. But when I got promoted and switched stores, the curtain rolled back and I got to see how bad things were as an ASM. The district manager was very demoralizing, no support from most of the staff, and just horrible culture. Politics played a huge role in who kept their jobs and who got promoted."
bad,"Expect to cover many departments as a customer service associate. "
bad,Not great for managing time or having a set schedule. Management could use some work on showing importance to task instead of unnecessarily trying to intimidate employees.
bad,They removed some of the positions that faithful employees have held onto the longest eg. Retireable position. They've also made huge cuts in air conditioning and heating. Giving us more training to do and expect us to do more in our positions for no more pay. Every month new positions are being cut and replaced with third-party companies
bad,"I worked 8 years for Lowes and realized they have zero loyalty and only care about the bottom line.  Do not work for Lowes, they say it‚Äôs all about the customer and their employees but the reality is much different."
bad,"If you plan on working here, know that you can be replaced at any time even if you are doing your job I work for them and Delivery for over 4 years with Lowe's and two and a half years through a contract employee at the same Lowe's also doing delivery. I did my job well but they lost the contract and gave the contract to XPO"
bad,"As a stocking crew member, you will never be bored. We have a lot of work to do and no overtime to get it all done. They keep putting more and more work on us that the sales floor or others should be doing. If we don't get all our work done in a day, we get chewed out by our boss. We get no help and the stocking crew has a very fast employee turn around."
bad,The management likes to pile on the work not making sure you get your breaks never enough help the more you do the more they pile on never enough not enough retribution for what you do while management bonus big on all your hard work
bad,With new CEO the company is in transition. Management positions have been revised over and over again. No public announcement of store policy changes such as Military and other discounts. Different interpretations of policies to be enforced.
bad,"You will have your own story to tell if you work for this company. I will guarantee anyone who works for Lowes will have more negative responses, then they will have positive."
bad,"Company has good potential if they make changes to culture From middle to senior leadership they utilize old school ‚Äúretailer‚Äù management.  They do things because ‚Äú they always have done it that way ‚Äú .    "
bad,"A typical day involves putting out fires upon setting foot in the building. This store is horrifically mismanaged at the top and the results are flowing down. Forget leading by respect. Forget any concept of respect whatsoever. Those under me were great and we had a great relationship. My immediate supervisor was good as well most of the times, but mainly because he doesn't always give in to the petty and disrespectful style of management asked of his superior. The hardest part of the job has to be completing all of the given tasks while also working to run the store because most of the ASMs can't be bothered to do anything resembling work."
bad,"Store manager is completely uninvolved and consistently absent, mostly unscheduled. Her attitude is life suckingly negative to the point of insanity. I was ASA and the job role duties have been reduced to such a minimum it became utterly boring. It was the need for someone to be in a position where Associates felt comfortable being able to have someone that has their best interest since the store manager stays locked up in her office like a teenage girl so she could avoid actually doing her job. She never hired internally for manager roles even though we had more than enough qualified and talented individuals that were already apart of the team and deserved a promotion."
bad,"There are many good things I can say about the company, but from my experiences, I would not recommend anyone to work at Lowes. The store I worked at was always dirty, confusing, and usually loud. The co-workers are usually kind, but management and higher-ups usually were ""Too busy"" to care about the lower fellows. I loved working the job itself, and it was actually kinda fun to interact with everyone. It's just the inconsistent scheduling and rude managers and the wild goose chases you had to go on for various information that brought the experience really down."
bad,"Probably the worst job I have ever had, the management is based on favoritism, they constantly over work the workers that are most reliable without hope of recognition, raises or any other compensation"
bad,"No support from Management. Employee favoritism like you won't believe. Do as I say not as I do attitude. Check the orange guys first, trust me. you'll thank me."
bad,"I got pretty burnt out my second year at lowes. I work in the delivery department and it requires a lot of physical exertion on a day to day basis. The problem is mostly that mangement doesnt seem to care much about its employees nor their well being. In store its hard to get cooperation from other departments as well as mangers of said departments. Overall, I greatly enjoyed the people I worked with and I have a lot of Job experience."
bad,The experience here was ok. Good team atmosphere when it can to the delivery team. Management allowed you to be yourself yet professional at the same time. Liability fell on you if you got pulled over or fined for truck papers not being up to date
bad,"Because you dont have set schedule,  it is hard to make plans. One day you would close, the next day you would open. Rarely have two days off in a row. Impossible to go to school, or improve yourself while working here. If you need to work full time, you have to agree to be available any day and any shift, so you cant take classes, etc."
bad,"Job security is a joke, fake people who would cut your throat to get ahead. Hated the day to day work, they tried to set rules in place but the business model s trash. CPO needs to be dissolved back to the store. I was told that by many customers."
bad,"The management was terrible. They would put 1 or 2 people on the side lot loading mulch on a busy Saturday and then get mad if we couldn't load fast enough, when ever more like 4 or 5 were necessary. One co-worker was on his phone all the time and refused to be of any help. The other brought a gun to work, and got a simple ""just go put it in your car""-management. And I got fired for be rude to a lady I never said a word to."
bad,"This Lowe's was located in Odessa, TX. Some weird things go down there. Plus the managers acted as if what they were doing was the reason for the store being so busy. I guess they never noticed the oil company trucks everywhere. Funniest part is the corporate bosses seemed just as clueless as why this store out preformed everyone. In all honesty, they might want to rethink who they put in those positions. While loyalty is a great thing, a little education could help...especially the economics of an area."
bad,"Bad bad management, laid off  all dept mgrs. dumb move laid off experienced and put less capable people in their place.  They preach customer service and they could care less in reality by getting rid of all the knowledge of their dept. managers so who are the employees to turn to get answers.  Their training is pathetic had a few days training and then was turned loose alone on the night shift.  HR Mgr. was always to busy to help people she is there to help and was rude to me and I witnessed to others.  Store manager would only criticize never complement.  Good employees trying hard to do the right things and management constantly frustrating these good people with total lack of support, and poor management skills."
bad,"Lowe's used to be a great company to work for, but after restructuring from the top down (which it needed), it just became the Walmart of hardware stores. They cut costs by cutting benefits and new-employee pay which means 80% of the store is filled with 18 year olds or people with no previous experience in retail or hardware. The amount of pressure put on you is unreasonable and laughable juxtaposed resources given and the pay. The full-time schedule is the closest thing to legal slavery I've experienced."
bad,"Your coworkers are what helps the days go by, and to keep you partially sane from the lack of competent management running the store. If it wasn't for your coworkers who share in your plight, you would quit in a  heartbeat."
bad,"Management was horrible. As the top sales person in the store with over 2 million dollars in sales, I was offered a .33/hr increase. So on 2.2 million dollars in sales, management offered me an annual increase of $660.00. How pathetic."
bad,Awful place to work. Long hours sometime 12 hours a day. Pay doesn't match the time worked. Favouritism runs deep within the company. Lousy managers. Nobody is held accountable for their actions.
bad,"Goals are always just out of reach. Company takes commissions in order to not give preference. We never saw anything to benefit employees from commission."
bad,I have been working here for a year so far. Of all my hi s none have ever made me feel lile just another employee number. Management has high expectations s but they dont want to pay you fairly to fulfill them. Good if you really need something but long term it is not worth it.
bad,"Lowe's was a good place to work when I started in 2013. I had a set schedule and was scheduled around my stated availability for the first five years. Since the new CEO has taken over, the focus is on management making bonuses at the cost of payroll and staffing. I had no hours from April 25th through May 5th. How are you supposed to pay bills with no income for 3/4 of a month?"
bad,"One of the worst companies I‚Äôve worked for"
bad,I‚Äôve wasted A lot of my time there. Co workers are jealous of each other and many are rats that go back and tell the boss everything that goes on the sales floor
bad,they abuse the ones who actually work and do nothing to those who dont work. over work the good workers until they quit. job is set up for those in college or are ready to retire.
bad,Stressful environment with few benefits for seasonal employees and physically demanding tasks. Working in the lumber department was especially taxing.
bad,"Lowe's does not value people from stores up to corporate despite a lot of talk from executives otherwise; people are numbers on an expense line to be reduced. Leadership changes direction/focus frequently and does not enable the business with the resources to execute strategies effectively. There is no work/life balance and employees are paid bottom dollar in the market. There is no investment in employees or attempt at retention. Expect a re-org every couple years; no job security. ""What have you done for me lately?"""
bad,"Never fun. Not enough people to cover depts. Will throw you to the wolves and move to the next person to run into the ground. Pay was alright but they promote butt kissers and YES people. Some days can be boring but if you kept busy, they would leave you alone. If they saw you not moving a write up was in your future."
bad,"Culture went from great too poor."
bad,Job is fine for extra money and okay benefits but not great if you are looking to move up the ladder.  Management is very critical and unforgiving of mistakes.  Don't get injured for any reason because if you do they will make your life awful.
bad,"To say I'm overworked is an understatement. Every month I'm given a slew of new responsibilities and am forced to do other people's jobs (""There are no walls in Lowe's). I come in every day and either have to clean up other people's messes, as both coworkers and management disrespects my desk and space, while also being expected to simultaneously pull orders and help customers while keeping an eye out for customers at my desk. If my desk is located at the entryway of the building and half the internet orders I have to stage are from fashion plumbing/appliances at the back of the building, how can I also be expected to watch for customers and answer my call bell? It isn't simply a matter of time management either as I get alerts when orders haven't been pulled for 30 or more minutes. Along with this I'm expected to answer phone calls and deal with customers in person, assist managers due to being power equipment licensed, and help unload trucks due to ASMs being unable to hire unloaders in a timely fashion. There is simply no way to balance the work and expectations. Pay, like with most big box retail chains, is mediocre given the number of responsibilities."
bad,Ineffective management and lazy co-workers make this a bad place to work.  Add in the low moral and constant drama and you have a living nightmare of a job.  Most employees start between 10 and 12 an hour.  Walmart across the street has a minimum of 12 as does target a couple blocks away.  The place is loud and dirty.  Stay away.
bad,"Lowes has poor management, favoritism, poor scheduling and lacks consideration for home-life, basically meaning it's impossible to look for more work or another job on the side or even plan anything beacause of the random shift changes. One day you'll be workin till 11 at night and the next you'll have to be back here by 7 am."
bad,"Employers don't care about personal life"
bad,"Co-workers. That is the only good thing that can be said about this company. Poor pay, poor benefits, poor work/life balance that all stemmed from poor management. Would not recommend this company at all."
bad,I have worked at lowes for almost two years and I have to say the management they have has been the worst management team I have ever seen out of all my jobs.
bad,It was good at the beginning but bad at the end.. something I'll never do again...it's okay if you're going to school and you want to make extra but a retirement job I say no...
bad,"Too much management walking around micro managing. Unfocused culture, busy bodies looking for next advancement. Corp has no clue.  Contractor sales are often not filled for weeks. Inventory is a mess"
bad,"The things that bother me about working at Lowe's was the general negative attitude of most of the staff members and managers. There was a lot of drama among full grown adults which was honestly kind of annoying, and definitely a downer at work. Management, and scheduling was extremely poor. Sometimes you'd only work four hours one day a week and sometimes you had to work long shifts for a week straight."
bad,"Open on day, close the next then turn around and open again. no that wasnt a nightmare i had that was a regular occurence and im fairly sure it breaks some kind of international laws of decency."
bad,"Bad management, favoritisms lack of advancement. Hardly any recognition for the job some of the workers do, work life balance is horrible, and no overtime"
bad,"You have to beg someone to watch your dept and handle your phone while you take lunch.  They will hire you for seasonal, work you to death then cut you after July 4th weekend.  It kills them that Home Depot is better then them. They now sell Sears Craftsman junk to compete with their own Kobalt junk!  The place need to be unionized big time!  Its way worse than Walmart, no price is fixed, you can go in their an make an offer on anything an they will take it, they are so hardup for a sell. Employees are stuck because they pay a bit mire then fast food, and most of them look like hillbillys."
bad,The work schedule was very irregular and days off not together.  Very low wages compared to the responsibility and amount of physical work.  I was not offered the opportunity to even apply for a higher position in the same department
bad,"they do not work around college students schedule "
bad,"At Lowe's customers come before employees. When I worked there I saw many experienced, skilled, tenured, and knowledgeable employees leave the company and they made no effort what-so-ever to attempt to retain them. In fact, after a company-wide store personnel restructure they actually encouraged some of their best people to leave just to save money on payroll."
bad,"The pay was bad and you don't get enough hours or you are scheduled to work on days you told them you weren't available. Not all Lowe's are equal. I started at the Lowe's in Nacogdoches Tx where everyone was like family and they really cared and scheduled you great even though the pay was low I didn't mind working there. Then we moved to Corpus Christi and all that changed. They were disorganized, mean, NOT a friendly environment at all. Never scheduled me enough hours. This store held different hours than the other one, opened at 6am & closed at 10pm."
bad,"Lack of teamwork/team, vacant management, no communication, no incentive. No sense of structure or direction. Management seems to turn an eye to any inconsistencies, employees have no voice, store environment is very gloomy and awkward."
bad,"Lowes has very poor management. Policies change weekly. A lot of favoritism between management and employees, even if the don't do there job. Not the same ground rules for everyone."
bad,Management is terrible. Inconsideration for employees individual needs and well-being. Anti-union. Very demanding with low reward. Made to feel as if youre easily replaceable
bad,"People are discouraged to perform. No job security. Management only cares about the bottom line. Scheduling is very unbalanced, driving people to the edge."
bad,Lowe's LP consisted of stacks of paper work. The majority of the job included paperwork that the ASM did but you were still required to complete and it was checked during visits. You were also required to deal with both external and internal theft which is what Loss Prevention should consist of but it was hard to focus on the two while buried underneath paperwork. The salary was low compared to the work required and it was also hourly.
bad,Job was overly hyped during training which was 6-8 weeks in an elementary style environment where we were constantly scolded for asking too many questions or colaberating with one another. Atmosphere was almost military in nature. Also the training was really useless. We sat through 6 weeks of outdated PowerPoint slides that had us all lost by the end of it all. Also they had us shadow the wrong dept. We were hiring for CDO and they had us sitting with people in sales where we sat behind an individual and watched what they did. There is an extreme amount of favoritism as stated on other reviews. Some people get help from management and others not so much. Once a manager doesn‚Äôt like you your ‚Äúout‚Äù. Was let go after giving my manager a present for Christmas with no warning and under strange circumstances. I‚Äôd personally look elsewhere.
bad,Management is really bad. It runs along the side of militaristic. You do not have a say in how things are done and it does you no good what so ever to let management know of a problem with another manager.
bad,"It may only be the store in which I was employed, but management created a hostile and uncomfortable environment.  My co-workers were always kind and helpful with customers, but management was not kind to staff.  I stayed with the company for many years because I liked the work, enjoyed working with customers, and my coworkers.  If management would have spent more time listening to their staff, and less time bickering and wasting energy on petty grievances, the store could be more successful."
bad,I used to love my job but management is poor the employees run the store while u have very little management they have no idea what their doing there an its customary to call someone else to do work very few managers will actually step in and do the job im honestly surprised more stores havnt closed u will work hard and do more than ur paid for at all times ur ment to be the worker the manager and whtever else u need all the while not having enough help
bad,Within 6 months of employment as a frontend manager I lost 3 head cashiers. Management took almost 3 months to hire one replacement. Was laid off and given a year to find another position in the company for significant pay cut.
bad,don't get injured while at work  you are treated terrible by Cooperate not much more to say you are treat at best poorly by after a short period of time they suspend your benefits they even try to stop paying you force you to retain an attorney to protect your rights sad situation
bad,i just left lowes after 6 years. store was 2360. pay is poor for the amount of work you do. I have worked at three lowes stores over the past 6 years. i sell appliances as a weekend we team member.
bad,It has changed a lot. A lot of downsizing and releasing of the veteran associates seems to be the norm. All new faces wanted! And not for full time. I‚Äôm not what‚Äôs going on with Lowes
bad,"Having worked for over 8 years I saw many changes that where not well thought out and moral was usually very low.  Managements main concern was getting numbers necessary for their bonuses, not customer service or employees."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked. The LP schedule is crazy and allows for no quality of home life. Little to no room for advancement within the LP structure.
bad,"Management really needs training on how to interact with the employees! There was minimal if any encouragement or positive feedback. They apparently don't realize without the front line employees, management would not have their jobs."
bad,Administration is terrible. They don‚Äôt support employees they only care about the numbers. They hire seasonal employees and don‚Äôt keep any of them. They give false hope.
bad,No career advancement not enough pay! Fixed schedule it‚Äôs good for part timers only. Don‚Äôt appreciate the workers always asking to sell more items and bring in money.
bad,"Management can‚Äôt make schedules correctly to save their lives. Give us a skeleton crew to run the floor and wonder why we aren‚Äôt as productive. We need help on the floor, but they cut so many hours we don‚Äôt get it. There‚Äôs never a manager around when you need them for something."
bad,"Ok place to work, employers not happy. Do not have problem resolution or people in the right place to help customers properly. The training not long enough for the different positions they want you to know"
bad,"The management practices and ethics issues in this store are astoundingly appalling. I have never worked with a more disrespectful group of managers in my life. The things that this management team gets away with and blames floor staff for is astounding! Not one of them deserve to be in the position they are in, nor do any of them have the training to out work the floor staff!"
bad,"Love working for Lowe's but no stability on hours, health benefits and to advance in moving up in the company. Lacks job security although its a pleasure working with the employees there but to utilize and further my skills within the company i'm unable to."
bad,"Leadership is poor from the top down. Poor decisions on work schedules and coverage is always a problem with coverage in all departments. No experienced people in most departments to answer questions,"
bad,"The job environment at Lowe's is bad the store was always under staff, management was very bad the store manager treated the employees like dirt and was very difficult to work with. Their was no training for employees to learn different things to work in other departments, they just throw you out their with no experience for you to help the customers. Lowe's as a company offer tuition reimbursement if you go to college, but they don't try work with your school schedule and make you chose either work for them are go to school."
bad,"The story I worked at hire people that did nothing, managers there never on the same page so nothing was consistent. I did not got treated good when I worked there and managers did not care to help the situation. My store was always under staffed so I alway got told that I would have to do others peoples job and do my job and half the time I was the only one in my department, I did not get paid enough to do other people‚Äôs job. Most of the time they got paid more then me. Over all I meat some wonderful people that I‚Äôm still friends with but other then that I did not have a good experience working at Lowe‚Äôs."
bad,Job pays well yet promotion is limited and high volumes of workplace stress due to staffing versus customer traffic is unreasonable. Scheduling fairness is virtually nonexistent.
bad,Mandatory overtime. Understaffed and overworked. Management did not care about workers. Everything had to be done right now. They did not care how much you had already worked that day.
bad,"Great workplace if you're a manager, or if you make salary and you're under 30 (they don't promote folks over 30). Good luck if you're hired as seasonal or part-time. Don't bother applying for internal positions, they've already picked someone else for the position, even if you're the most qualified. Nothing works, technology is decades old, morale is low, culture is broken, and all those benefits they keep touting only go to full time permanent employees (which they're not really hiring)."
bad,"Expect to work more than 3 departments with no raise/no promise of one. Also, a computer tells you what your going to get paid. Horrible Benifits....."
bad,"It's an okay job if you like an ever changing schedule, incompetent management team, low job security, and not enough employees to staff a location. Honestly it's fine for a part-time job but nothing other than that. The pay is pretty good though."
bad,It's not bad hourly pay but little room for advancement. Management seriously needs work. They don't show that they are family friendly. Training is sub par. Job isn't bad but since the restructuring happened we've lost so many good employees and its changed the stores morale to being very negative.
bad,"Ok place to work.  Pay isn't the best.  HR person is extremely prejudice. You are offered a better , higher paid position then she sweeps you off because you are not the minority of color and then hires 3 minority people to fill the position you were told you had."
bad,"The plan is not there.  The management doesn't really care, they are most likely concerned with their own positions."
bad,"working more then what you are originally hired for, expected to do more for the same pay to make sure customers love where they live. Getting told your not doing enough for your position, on top of doing manager work for same pay. Not getting recognition where it is deserved to get recognized."
bad,"Management is unorganized, understaffed, working in very high or low temperatures depending on the time of year, highly mentally and physically stressful for pay that couldn't afford the cheapest housing in the Charleston area. This is all a review for the OSLG department at a specific store. Other departments have their own benefits/flaws that are unrelated to the garden center."
bad,"ok benefits, no job security, little to no advancement. They love to dangle a carrot for advancement but rarely follow through with them. Will work with you somewhat for medical leaves."
bad,"not bad, managment doesnt trust on you.,poor customer service .good bennifit,advancement for some people,co workers are very good except managment/store manager.i spend 15 years of my life  i drop my money on the floor and become accused of shrinkage loss preventions people,dont want to listen any clarification telling me i was make story,"
bad,This company fancies it self as a family driven company . Not true at all . unless you have one of those nice corporate jobs you will Barely see your family yet alone have enough time to spend with them. Managerial and supervisory tasks are pushed upon  associates. Will be hired for one job expected to do three others and held accountable for unrealistic expectations.
bad,It's hard work at Lowe's. Making it  okay to deal with if you like that work life. Make sure you can handle fast pace work. Be very responsible when you attend work
bad,"No room for expressing options for directives. Lack of complete communication with directives. Not all of Lowes functions this way, but in this region , my survey results are accurate."
bad,"Overall, this place sucked to work at, but it‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre trying to get through college and need a flexible work schedule. I was still overworked considering I went to school full time - I was part time and worked almost full-time hours, and never had a weekend off unless I asked (started out getting about 1 weekend a month off, occasionally another day too). Some of the managers were great, but most were quite lazy and would just mill around talking to people. Not that I cared about this, but if you‚Äôre interested in advancement, Lowe‚Äôs is not the place because they cut almost all entry level management jobs."
bad,Working here is easy but the lack of good managment really faulters the companies inability to lead others and get work done. I feel they also lack in getting things fixed they are not quick to maintain a good facility as they should.
bad,The company thrived on what appeared to be a fear based culture designed to get results.  Upper level management constantly threatened employees' careers and would visit stores specifically to find reasons to threaten employees' careers.
bad,The managers are awesome and very caring and nice. The receiving boss lady was so mean. She always yelling at me in how iI was unloading and putting boxes on the wrong pallets. When I was reading the tags and putting them on the right pallets. She was really lazy disappeared all the time.
bad,the work environment was toxic and the views of the many managers differed from what you as an employee would be told. the management team lacked communication within themselves and the employees under them
bad,"Management does a wonderful job of ensuring all employees hear what they want to hear, regardless of how factual it may be. In low season, when the store is quiet, they'll tell you hours are getting significantly cut due to low store traffic, while also hosting job fairs and ""National Hiring Day"" at the same time, while also promising you your hours will start to increase now. "
bad,"a typical day at work would be running from one end of the store to the other giving overrides and helping cashiers with very little help from management unless you get lucky and are working with the few who actually care."
bad,"I liked the job, it was great, fast paced, easy to know aisles, and customers and gotten trained on the cash register, but I didn't get along with the new store manager, as he was consistently yelling at us cashiers to go faster, when we are already going as fast as we can with outdated registers, and waiting on management to swipe their ""red card"" for approval of alcohal/tobacco sales, and registers/card readers would constantly crash/freeze up stalling the checkout process. Other than that, I had no formal complaints about working there."
bad,The managers can range from young to very old causing them to be either without the proper knowlege to manage or to be too old to help anyone the company also has a horrible system to raise up in. The company gives a small raise every year an employee is there and another small and i mean small raise if an employee switches his or her department and begins working there bow the catch to that is that once an employee switches departments the yearly raise resets to day one which is awful and a terroble way to run a buisness save yourself the time and find a better place to work.
bad,"There's no room for advancement, poor managed time, workers run thin, obvious favorites. Raises were very low and few and far between. Moral was horrible unless you were the bosses friend."
bad,The management at Lowe's was completely and utterly unprofessional due to one manager. The company hired you on as one job and wanted you to work all sections of the store. This is definitely not a fun job to work at. The people you worked with were friendly and you bonded with. The turnover rate for employees at Lowe's must be extremely high.
bad,"tiring, management got bad would ask a lot from certain employees while others did nothing. bad pay, horrible on doing 30 day reviews to get hired on full time, managers would always hide in stressful situations"
bad,"Like many other reviews of this company, it has its moments where it was a cool place to work.  Learned even more construction knowledge than I previously had, worked in the lumber and building materials department and got to have a nice workout moving stuff.  ""red vest ready"" training program was an embarrassment and quite possibly the cheesiest way to train someone, not to mention it really didn't help at all."
bad,"As an HRM, you were over worked and under paid. Your salaried, but  scheduled to work 50+ hours a week. With the staffing restructure coming, I wouldn't be surprised if they removed all HRs from the store. This whole restructure has been terrible, execution was terrible and very little time for training."
bad,"Barely any hours or benefits for part timers."
bad,I have worked for Lowe's for almost 11 years and no raise in the last 4 years and my position of Installed Sales is being eliminated. The Company has eliminated all Department Managers positions and have redesigned the management staff which has resulted in poor employee moral.
bad,"If you want a part time job Lowes is the place. However, after 20 years of no advancement and poor corporate management I have decided to pursue other job opportunities with more of a future. The restructure is forcing out all tenured and knowledgeable employees. Limited employee training and engagement."
bad,Took 2 years to move to full time in this company. Even after trying for the full 2 years. Always short staffed but could never get overtime. Management was rude to employees.
bad,Our store stayed severely understaffed so the employees stayed stressed out 99% of the time. HR was an absolute joke. The biggest plus was you got breaks and lunches on time for the most part.
bad,Great company but but lack of Human Resources assistant  lack of understanding of clockin in An clocking out issue . Administration office general adm
bad,"Team members are so-so, Shift supervisors are absolutely clueless at times. Backbreaking job and morale can be very low, especially with lack of employees."
bad,"Don't work here if you want structure. Managers are incoherent and do not care about their workers needs nor wants unless it"
bad,"It was a good environment,  good energy and a lot to do.  I was promised a full time position multiple times by multiple managers and never got the positions even after a speedy interview. I went to work and did my job 110% every day to try and move up in order make a living for my self as a young adult. I was unable to do that by being kept part time."
bad,"bad home life work balance, Terrible management. would not recommend. Very long hours without notice. Some days could be 10 hours others could be 15. cant plan for any kind of personal life because of how sporadic the work schedule is. Your essentially an over the road truck driver with rude customers and less pay."
bad,"When I began working for Lowes, opportunity for advancement was limitless.I worked hard by providing excellent service to both customers and employer(s). In return I was promoted twice. All within my first year of employment. When management changed in or around 2006 or 2007 Things changed, our culture changed, sales performance changed within the departments. we started to lose our best knowledgeable co-workers . After,2 years of employment  I was barley making 12 hr.:(  I wanted more out of my career. I wanted to earn a degree in business management hoping it would boost my career at Lowes. I was told by management, after telling them about my decision to go back to college, while maintaining my position with them.  I was told I couldn't. I was told I would have to remain open availability without exceptions. After that conversation with Management, I gave notice and went back to school and earned my college degree (in the legal field). Looking back, I never regretted it. Lowes, at the time, never really looked after their employees, at least not the Norwalk location 2007. They always pushed their employees just to see how much they can get out them and threw a lot of the great ones away like they were disposable."
bad,"I don""t have time to write about all the flaws this company has. I don't make enough money here to keep my boat afloat. Currently looking for other jobs.."
bad,"The HR rep is the most difficult to work with. If you bow down or keep quite your fine, but point out how horrible she is at her job and your out. She's an idiot."
bad,Good if you have average skills. In relation to career advance goals...for teenagers or retired the delivery was laid off and they went to a third party delivery company
bad,Company was once a great place to work.  Things are doing downhill fast.  Very little incentive and horrible District/Regional/Corp support staff.  Store is usually understaffed and employees are forced to  cover departments they are not trained in.
bad,"The distribution center has been through 4 general managers since I've been there , each one progressively worse than the last. I have personally had 10 separate department heads in my 5 years."
bad,"Management does not recognize work ethic, employees that do not "
bad,its an ok job. the management is never on the same page. The way the other employees talk to you is vulgar and rude. Everyone is always ready to pass the job task on instead of doing it themselves.
bad,Good people to work with ( co-workers ). Communication from all levels of management is very poor. Very high turnover in my department. No shift premium for overnight shift.
bad,Poor Managment and insufficient number of employees which requires wortking in departments outside your scope of business and results in poor customer service and dealing with angry customers.
bad,"This is a good first job, but that being said employees aren't working toward a career and communication is strongly needed. Good for second job or part time work but low pay and some positions offer very low hours"
bad,"This is the most disorganized business in the USA.It is a cluster everyday! If you want a job where nobody nows whats going on and just wings it,this place is for you."
bad,All managerial decisions are based upon friendships and upon value of employee nor seniority creating a stressful relationship in the work environment
bad,"Lowe's likes to restructure and eliminate higher positions, making it difficult to advance. No loyalty. Recognition is limited to other employees leaving ""thank you"" notes on a board in the break room."
bad,"good pay but schedules kill you, bad management, poorly organized, no team work, they  pretend you work  everywhere, very bad coverage  in sales floor all the time.."
bad,The managers only care about what they have to do and rarely care about others. We were very short staffed and often and to stay till midnight to finish our work.
bad,"not very organized, lack of work on some peoples part, communication was not good. management could have been better about organizing time for each employee and what we should be doing."
bad,"There was absolutely no training, tasks are handed out and expected to be done by your staff and if your staff does not complete you do, atop of the 50-60 hours, atop of the lack of training, atop of the constant employee complaints to management and lastly they are quick to fire, you make HR or SM or LP mad, for what ever reason, kiss your job goodbye."
bad,"Not recommended. Typically running 100,000 square foot or more store.  Management of 75 or more people and profit and loss accountability.  The most enjoyable are the employees and the customers.  The hardest is to deal with the upper management."
bad,Let me go because I was one of the older hands. I worked from 4am to 1 pm mom - fri. I done irp pricing taking down signage and wait on customers. Miss some of the people I worked with
bad,"A typical day at work was hard. Very hard. Lots of manual labor. From the time you started, you would sweat until you left, which was usually extremely late at night because the work you did was never enough to satisfy the lousy management. I learned what it meant to work hard and not be appreciated for hard work. Management was abysmal. People who had never worked at a hardware-type warehouse were managers. So you would do your best to keep giant bays of concrete and lumber stocked with forklifts, all the while trying to clean every aisle spotless and have lumber/concrete carts inside. The hardest part of the job was working until midnight or later trying to satisfy the managers, who would not let you leave until they decided that the department was good enough to let be. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with their projects. The feeling that your customer service helped somebody better their home was always rewarding."
bad,"Too many customers, not enough workers. The whole job in its self is really terrible, you have no help, and a store manager running the store into the ground."
bad,"I was hired as a temporary waterer and i hated it.  I tried to do my best but it wasn't good enough. It really wasn't a good fit for me because i didnt have a good chance to work with customers very often.  Also getting up at 6am every day was really affecting my health and sleep patterns.  Management was nice enough and a few of the employees i worked with were great, but one employee was very hard to work with.  Being a temporary job i didnt expect much but the pay was great even though i hated the job."
bad,"Limited accountability and many people are so concerned with losing their job, the culture has become very micromanaged. The only real perk is not driving uptown in traffic."
bad,"I worked in delivery for 6 months and then was randomly moved to cashier. It is the most boring job you will ever have. The managers are incredibly stuck up and will hound you for every second of their precious time. "
bad,Lowe's has changed. It is not a great place to wok anymore.  Leadership is too busy chasing stock price instead of investing in the employees.  Lowes will be the next Circuit City.
bad,Ok company to work for just don't get comfortable. I don't think it's the company in general just the people that work there. Good for a part time I would rethink full time!
bad,"Chaotic, every person is on a different page. There is  no consistency  throughout the engagement team, no  transparency.  You think  you are doing everything correctly, and you are  getting into trouble  because it is  not the right way, even though it  is according to the  few SOPs  that are in place, but your manager has their own idea and doesn't share. So you are constantly looking over your shoulder to get  escorted out."
bad,Working at Lowe's was okay. It was not very rewarding and the fellow employees where not very nice. Managers wouldn't give me enough hours and wanted me to only work on the weekends. I wouldn't work there again. I like shopping there but not working there.
bad,"The day to day changes on a weekly basis, the needs and wants of the buying market dictates the priorities set forth by the upper management team and rolls downward through the departments."
bad,There is no ability for advancement.   There is a severe lack of support from management.   The rules are not uniformly applied.  There is no sense of team support in the delivery department.
bad,Lowe's has restructured their company in a way i'm no longer okay with .It used to be a great place to work know it is no longer fun
bad,Not a good place for a family person!  Corporate restructure cost me my job.  Why not start at the top where the money was wasted.  13 years I have given all I have and management an not even look at me.
bad,This job served as an adequate position for younger kids in high school or a part time college job. There was not much advancement within the company unless you were a full time employee working with the company for multiple years.
bad,very difficult customer base always left by yourself when closing very little staff for support  very limited hours to support customer flow many disengaged associates due to the additional work load
bad,Days can feel supper long when you don‚Äôt have the staffing numbers to affectively make the store run. Work place is dirty and congested. Management takes a back seat and is not often seen.co-workers are frustrated due to lack of staffing and low pay. Hardest part of the job is wanting to keep going to a job you don‚Äôt enjoy.
bad,Feels like a prison where your opinion does matter it's like a dictatorship  the management don't have a very friendly demeanor to employees and the do a horrible job managing the employees
bad,I've worked at Lowes for a year and I've applied for things that I'm qualified for that seasonal employees got the job over me who had not worked a min of 6 months.  My managers in my department bully people they don't like. I also have not been given a raise which is based upon our experience level.
bad,"Lowes has followed the steps of many other ""big-box"" retailers ... like Walmart and many others. They eliminated many FULL-TIME employees, no longer offer health insurance, put employees on Part-Time, reduced working hours so that benefits packages could be eliminated. No incentives."
bad,"50-60 hour weeks mandatory. are you kidding me? you are just a number at the RDC, trapped by the pay!! work is almost excruciating. too many chiefs not enough indians. they can't even keep coaches!"
bad,"Overworked and understaffed. I joined the team in February and received more hours within a matter of weeks. Which was fine, until I found myself dealing with the ""bulk"" of the work. I do not mind hard work if it is evenly distributed. Some nights I would close the store and then open the next morning. It is very tiresome physical work. And I never had a weekend off since I started."
bad,"Poor work/life balance with ridiculous scheduling."
bad,"Lowe's puts too much focus on policy and procedure rather than self improvement to become more competitive. Their hiring and promotion focus is on diversity rather than experience and skills. They are a customer is ALWAYS right company, that follows the leader rather than forging their own path to success."
bad,"I learned nothing, My pay was okay, not too bad. Management did not get to know any of the employees, so we would just come in, work then and go home."
bad,I worked for the company for 10 years and was passed over for upper management multiple times. Not a place for women who want to climb the corporate ladder.
bad,"Lowe's hires ANYONE! They mass hire, and wait for people to drop off. Human Resources WILL lie to you. They will tell you what you want to hear if they want you. Management teams are garbage. They are like chain gang officers. They walk or ride around in a golf cart and critique. Lots of favourtism and cliquey atmosphere. The actual team members are great people just needing to feed families. Lowe's may have taken over Target leases, however if they don't shape up... they will be out just as quick as Target was."
bad,"You start out happy wanting to work and make the company grow, then it hits you...they (management) does not care about you. You spend years give and all you get is...well nothing.  They only way your going to make it there is your ""cool"" like that manager.  WARNING: This place is ""TOXIC"" you will hate everyday you walked into the store."
bad,If you wanna work at lowes you have to wok three times harder then everybody because the older employees don't do anything and IF upper management doesn't like then don't expect to be there that long
bad,I worked hard for them and got let go after the Season it was a long time ago and i do not remember a lot about the job. I was a receiver so i mostly just took product off a truck and loaded it on the sales floor
bad,I personally use to love working with this company but lately this company has been so full of it. I work in the front at customer service. I never have any help maybe from a few of my co workers. There is never enough coverage on the front end. They are cutting everyone's hours but then are complaining because we do not have enough help to get the customers in and out. Half of the managers do not know how to do basic things such as cutting wood. Lately I've been just really fed up with this company. And the minute I find another job I'm leaving.
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job was working with the cashiers and floor employees, it was also gratifying when customers would recognize you or remember you and want to line up in your cashier line. "
bad,"Providing and maintaining computer systems and other data services needed "
bad,"This job was just a steady paycheck for me.  My self worth diminished while working at Lowe's.  The management was not up to par with how to run things smoothly.  There was not quality of work, or respect when good work was given.  This is not a good place to work if you are looking for a long term job."
bad,"high turn over rate."
bad,"This company does not guarantee hours and cuts hours and employees too much. You will not make enough to survive even as a second job. The pay is great and the benefits too, but again, only full time get the hours needed to survive...part time and seasonal can be cut to 0 hours a week and 40 the next. Management is hit and miss here, so find a place you feel comfortable working before deciding if you are going to stay on."
bad,"The lowes store I worked at in Forsyth, IL seemed like it was going to be a good place to work. The first couple weeks seemed good, then I started noticing how things worked around there. None of the Managers were good at anything, it seemed like they would delegate work to lower employees and then not teach them how to do it. If the employee messed it up then they (the employee) would be wrote up. The Managers also slept with the employees a lot. If you are not planning on having a ""open""relationship with management then don't even apply because you will not get promoted unless you are willing to go the extra mile. There are Managers right now that are taking lunch breaks together and meeting at employee houses and ""hooking up"". HR really needs to look into this because they all know these things go on and if you tell someone you will end up fired like me. If all the managers were cleaned up then this could be a great place to work."
bad,Productive and professional environment.  Learned that the most important part of the job is to give great customer service and keep them coming back.
bad,Be prepared to work really long hours and get ready for the management team to call  you in the office and threaten your job for taking so long to run your route.  Even though your route will have you all over the place multiple counties. I've seen them fire employees on the employee's day off.  Also the management team will smile to your face and cut you when your back is turned.  Also  the guys you will work with  will also lie on you to save their own backs.
bad,"Overall I felt I was working with childish tattle tales.   Come on and grow up .  I worked for a month in outside garden. I kept noticing everday there was some sort of rule that covers everything from breaks to helping a customer jump start a car.  You cant do that with your vest on, specific parking that no one told you about ( inside the yellow line) handicap parking everthing has a rule associated with it and even if you made a honest mistake  and admitted it they seemed to hold it against you going forward. "
bad,The only people in store that get moved up are mangers. You cannot even get a job at a mangers status because they say you do not fit there needs.
bad,"I was excited about starting work here.  There is plenty to do and the people are, for the most part, friendly.  But their smiles hide who they really are, especially management.  It doesn't matter how hard you work, they will look for ways to fire you.  You may think you are doing a good job, but don't be surprised when you are terminated at the moment you apply to move up within the company.  Yes, some people are promoted, but this place has a very high turnover of employees.  I don't know why, exactly, but employees don't last long here."
bad,"This is the ideal place to learn patience, customer service and flexibility"
bad,"unless you are a suck up you will not get far, even if you do your job 100 times better then everyone else, if your not buddy buddy with managers your stuck. example lowes says they do questions at interviews and the highest scoring get the postion, well thats bs.  2 part times applied for the same new opening first part timer gets the postions beating the second, the second was all buddy buddy with managers, the second also applied for a department manger postion,   he interviewed for that and got it, so to make this clear he was not good enough to get a normal full time postion but he was good enough for a manager.. plus if your a male plain on doing all the heavey work while the females  deal with customers, even if you have the same job title doesnt matter as a male your going to work 3 times as hard for the same pay.  very sexiest company. plus they like to make part timers managers first over full timers due to the pay.  if you start as a part timer you rate will be lower then a full timer  example pt would be 8 to 9 an hour ft round 10 to 12 , now they way the do it is if your a part timers get manager they bump you by a % so now that pt making 8 to 9 is making 10 to 12. vs a ft making 10 to 12 would  go to 15 to 16.  dont get me wrong for retail job its good money but if you can deal with all the bs its fine, if you go in and just do your job even if its well if you dont make friends with the store manager your not going anywhere. anyone tells you different there lieing."
bad,"While there are lots of good people that work there my experiences are questionable.   The job description changed after I was hired, according to other's a common experience with this company.  There is little or no training you are basically expected to know everything even about internal procedures, the worst part of which is there is a complete lack of team support or consistency from supervisors or managers.   There is a expectation by management you will place the store before all other aspects of your life,  Though they are unwilling to provide the aforementioned support and try to avoid the responsibilities of their own positions.   "
bad,Customer service scope of work was rewarding.  Lack of regular schedule and number of hours not so rewarding.
bad,you have some real perverts working there just watch out for joe dave femi and david an andy is always trying ti have nasty things with someone
bad,Management played favourites and was extremely unfair.Had harassment claims THROWN AWAY because he/she was a good friend of the manager!
bad,"Worked at distribution center in rockford il 3yrs.. the training is terrible so be prepared to ask whoever ur working by to show you how to do the job.. A performance instructor is who trains you, but they have no clue on how to do the job.. for example they promote team members from each dept to be a P.I., so a person who is really good in the shipping dept is promoted to P.I and instead of them staying in shipping and training new shipping team members they make them the Receiving P.I ... so their training new hires to do a job that they've never done lmao smh i couldnt believe it.. then management dont care about what you do or how hard you work, only care about hitting their numbers for the day.. your pretty much an employee ID number.. They favorite workers heavily too, long as you brown nose you get all the easy work.. it dont matter if you work twice as hard as them.. they preach safety all the time but yet dont care about you.. they never take accountability for their poor equipment condition either.. if it breaks or malfunctions its your fault for not noticing it on ur equipment checklist.. i didnt realize you had to be a mechanic as well, when there are mechanics out there that get paid to maintain the equipment and perform inspections every so many hours"
bad,Typical work day consists of receiving 3-4 trucking shipments and stocking shelves all day long.
bad,"I started working here as a seasonal associate, I was told that I could prove myself and get hired as a permanent associate. However months into the job I stepped up learned everything I could learn from my current position. Worked as hard as I could even got managers to see that I was a leader, which for my introvert self is amazing. I loved my manager he was fun, a good man, was open and easy to talk to and trained us well."
bad,"I worked at lowes for 4 years, thrived at what I did, got kudos but no advancement .they like to hire outside the comany before promoting their own."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is customers come looking for me because they know I will help them or find them the help they need."
bad,"The ""management"" and other supervisors were horrible people. They did not care for anyone other than them selves. They had favorites and never helped anyone with anything."
bad,They got my carrier of drafting started.  That's the only positive thing I can say.
bad,Being a assistant store manager at Lowe's is not for someone who wants a good home life.  There is NO training program for ASM's and the expectation is that you learn and know everything on your own.  Tough world especially when the boss is not supportive and is bi-polar.  Tough environment.
bad,"Horribly jaded place to work. Hours are horrible, climate at work is just as bad, and there are major politics going on in the work place, so no room for advancement"
bad,"Be prepared for Big Brother... Field Leadership has virtually every Store Manager on a Final Written Warning and manage through intimidation."
bad,"I worked at Lowe's for a little over a year. My experience there was less than enjoyable. They treat their employees like trash, they hardly let you advance unless your friends with management. The workload is unfair and they allow their ""veteran employees"" stand around and talk while everyone else works their butt off. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL."
bad,"There is no room for advancement, if you are  good they will not let you move. "
bad,"‚Ä¢	Provided prompt, friendly service by enthusiastically seeking out customers to evaluate their needs and provide assistance."
bad,"A typical day was hectic from start to finish, trying to stick to SOP and completing the necessary tasks in my own department, it was also required to help customers on the sales floor with no knowledge of the product or how to use it, etc."
bad,Unload trucks and stock merchandise using fork equipt. General cleaning and maintainence of inventory.
bad,"mangers are not valued by this company, associates don't listen to direction and sales are low, customer service is very low."
bad,"Scheduling is ridiculous. You get one weekend every four (which to be truthful should be expected in retail) but then the ""standardized"" schedule punishes you with 7 straight days of varying shifts without regard to sleep cycles; then one day off and a minimum of 4 more days on for the privilege of having that weekend off. Managers could control this but it's too much bother and time away from myriad of tasks company says it doesn't have them working on."
bad,"Overwork you, don't allow you to lean against anything to relieve your feet/legs, horrible management"
bad,"I worked in several different departments, and learned much by doing this."
bad,"Management does not seem to know what is actually going on. Cashiers spend all day on their feet with little support from the sales staff when it comes to problems that arise at the registers. Staff is cut to the barest minimum. There are some great people there, but the majority of workers are just there to put in time, not to work. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get the customers the help thy need when there is a problem or they need help loading their purchase.The most enjoyable part isthe time I get to spend with the customers that become regulars."
bad,"Typical day at work starts with answering phones while helping customers. I have learned how to write break/lunch sheets, and how to help customers while helping co-workers at the same time. The hardest part of the job is handling unhappy customers, and lack of effort from upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the gratification of knowing I did what was needed and met my customer`s needs and wants."
bad,"I enjoyed majority of my co-workers even some of the management, but some of the management could use a personality makeover. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,"I work from 5am to 2pm, I work on resetting of product, make sure the store is clean. I work with computers, looking up planogram that show what the displays are suppost to look like. I learned now to work with the computer systems. The hardest part of my job is having to work on ladders up high and haveing to working shorthanded. I enjoy working with people and working with computers. I love learning new things."
bad,"Leadership has made questionable decisions on people, finances and overall direction. Have a vision for where they are going but the direction keeps changing and is not clearly understood by the enterprise workforce."
bad,Company with many opportunities and room for advancement.
bad,The company itself is a good company to work for but the Edwardsville store is full of deceptive employees and management. Falsified beliefs are strung out through the store while secretively the truth happens behind closed doors. The lack of staffing in this store is horrendous. The lack of skilled and attentive management is a common find within this facility. The only employees whom move ahead within this store are the ones who sell others out and are friends with senior management. SO do not join this store if you are seeking career advancement.
bad,Since I'm a department manager I take about fifteen to twenty minutes to walk around and create a worklist for myself and prioritize what needs to get done first. The hardest thing to do in my department and the rest of the store is finding a person to help you lift the heavy stuff that requires two people.
bad,Get to work schedule all other cashiers lunch and breaks. Make sure 3pd gets faxed.Pay is not bad but the hours are. Management plays favorites.
bad,Beware of the closing shift they will lock you in until the manager says its ok to leave regardless of schedule hours
bad,"Management does not seem to be overly concerned that people are working an extreme amount of overtime. There is no flexibilty in the schedule. We have start times and end times on the schedule, however the time you get off might be 2 to 3 hours after the fact."
bad,Management politics on the retail level is for beyond the norm. They offer you tuition reimbursement but no set schedule at all in order to set your class schedule around
bad,"My review about this job, Management was not up to par on anything. I loved working with the customers making them happy. Maintained a good work ethic, but was not satisfied at all with the treatment."
bad,"Loews was below satisfactory. I worked as a cashier/usher, I was underpaid and work conditions were harsh."
bad,"very productive workplace,and customer-focused,learning new tasks every day, i get to learn different departments,"
bad,Good place to work conservative and Work life balance is median
bad,Not able to provide for my family in my current position. I am not being used to my full potintial.
bad,"Lowe's talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk when it comes to thinking and reacting outside the box. The good ol' boy network is, unfortunately, alive and well. Growth and advancement depends far less on knowledge and expertise (at certain levels) and more on willingness to suck up to the right people and throw others under the proverbial 'bus.' Pay is pretty good on the operations side of the house and at the Sr - Executive levels. If you're participating in the selection process, be aware of low-ballers. Insist on pay that aligns with what you're bringing to the 'table.'"
bad,Management has heavy favoritism. They have a set time to work and if you need a flexible hours this is not the place. Their night shift completely drains you and only people who have worked there 5+ years get day shift.
bad,To lowes you are just another employee there isn't much job security. They constantly change their policies which makes it very hard to not get in trouble for things if they are constantly changing. They dont care about any of your life outside of work and will work you crazy hours. Not worth the pay.
bad,"Poor work/life balance, poor management, part timers work 10 hours shifts. Very inconsistent with scheduling. Very draining and easy to become burntout."
bad,"I worked for the RDC and I have to tell you it was the worst experience of any job I‚Äôve had, they preach safety and leaving the same way you come in, but yet anything to hit your numbers. Management pushes you to work hard that‚Äôs fine but also unsafe, I was a platinum performer and still was lectured about my performance, completely understaffed all the time, and that‚Äôs because people are leaving  all the time."
bad,I was going above and beyond helping others not to mention I was a favorite with some customers yet an still they don‚Äôt care about the workers there they have favoritism at the job and they jus literally use you up
bad,The company is in a period of transition.  Change happens everyday; but they really need to concentrate more on theft prevention.  They have a great handle on customer service with their SMART program.
bad,Always changing environments. Management always has more stops to do even after your shifts end. This company only wants to protect its profit margins at the cost of the worker
bad,middle management are pressured to hit numbers and do all manner of things that make the work enviroment horrible.  if youre looking for a place to be heard and contribute look elsewhere  joining Lowes has been the biggest mistake in an otherwise decent 30 year career.
bad,They do not hold employees accountable for anything. One big mess most days. Met some great friends we bounded over how horrible it was working there and how unappreciative some member's of management were. There were a few management members who cared about there job and actually worked. Most did not and it showed throughout the whole store.
bad,"Lowe's backed me in taking care of the customer. I was given latitude to make things right for the customer. They really  stood up here, letting me do what was right"
bad,"Its a good STARTER CDL job, However Lowes  did not care about there employes ,And it seems the longer you work there the less they value you has an employee,I worked there 16 years and when I turned my notice in they just told me to leave after only working 3 days of my notice ,Wow thank you for 16 years...... if you work there and intend to quit  just quit.... and to be promoted that  is a joke,"
bad,"poor management"
bad,The coworkers really make the day fun. But they have a lot of issues they need to address and management needs to hold themselves to high standard and protect their employees
bad,"The company was great when I started. It has gone downhill in the last year or so and it is not local management's entire fault. They share some blame for not being fair but the company as a whole is tanking. The shareholders are happy, but employees are not. Mu current store manager is great, his minions, not so much."
bad,"Most of the management were lazy and usually shrugged off their work onto lower employees. The bottom tier employees were nice and did their jobs well for the most part. The store's HR department was also very prejudice against part time workers for some odd reason, but like I said, most of the management there was terrible. It's a decent place to start out at for a summer job or such but it's definitely not somewhere I would have stayed."
bad,"They don't take into account your hard work that you have put into outside of work, such as in going to school and getting an education. They don't care if you have a bachelors degree or not, it can be good for some people but it can also be bad for others."
bad,"A typical day is nothing like you would want it to be. Everyday Is something different. "
bad,"Former managers used young and attractive(3)female associates as a dating pool: hence,greater opportunity for young single female work associates. HR failed to take any control and resolve the situation.  The workplace culture tremendously as a result. "
bad,"Lowes is a place where they will use your time and talents for years. You'll not be paid well for your time here in relation to your hardwork. And when you think your moving forward with the company, they'll take everything you worked for away for their own prosperity. Telling you to take it or leave it. I recommend leaving it unless you need the job, while your looking for a better one."
bad,Work life balance is not there unless you only work part time. There are to many changes happing from the top for any kind of job security. Every day is a gamble if you will have a job tomorrow
bad,"Depending on which store, your managers either take care of you or they don't give a dang about you. If you are not a butt kisser they don't care much about you. Would not recommend working for these managers. Store manager is great...the rest of them are pretty much worthless. Store should be ashamed of how they treat their employees"
bad,"Training portrays Lowes as a fantastic place to work. But after a week, management's true colors begin to show. I was truly surprised and disappounted. Now realize why Lowes is so far behind Home Depot."
bad,"Started out well at first. Then it became apparent that management was only in it for themselves and didn't have employees concerns at heart. People were awarded based off of sales, so if you work in the garden dept., a $400 washer will get you more money rewards then a garden sale will. Some of the sales associates were nice. A rather blue collar environment. Cashiers constantly called out and I was put on register without any training. The amount of callouts due to store environment made it very difficult to work there sometimes. I was often the only one in flooring, paint and home decor. Pay was horrible. Working three depts. and earning $13."
bad,"Demands in the Installed Sales office come from upper management, installers, customers and department leads. Work in cramped quarters for low pay. Horrible!!"
bad,"Constant scheduling issues, rude customers and little to no training or support from management. The people who work at lowes tend to be awesome, its a shame the job is not."
bad,"Life outside this company is much better. The money is pretty good but in the end your mental health will suffer greatly. Phones ringing off the hook, someone always complaining...unqualified managers breathing down your neck 24/7. They promote their buddies, if you can become good friends then you can move up!"
bad,You are told to leave your personal life at the door. At the time my husband was in the hospital dying. They did not care. It is even worse now. Management doesnt care about their employees. Horrible place to work. If the stores followed company policy it would be a tolerable place to work but they dont.
bad,Creative ideas are frowned upon.  The Assistant Managers really run the building and are held accountable as such. Too many throw you under the bus to advance their career versus actually earning it by working hard. Treating associates as individuals is not a priority.
bad,"Lowe's was a great place to work when I started as a sales specialist in 2014, but there were already signs at the time of the rapidly changing culture within the company. There is a double-standard in place at Lowe's (as with many large retail outfits today) that will continue to get in the way of the company advancing any further forward as a quality retail business (in my opinion). The mission of the ""Customer First"" is what Lowe's advertises and pushes to its customer and employees. In reality, however, there is very little focus on the customer at Lowe's, and I witnessed several changes myself that had objectively zero consideration for customer (or employee) satisfaction when implemented. The challenges faced by this organization are understandable in today's shifting economy, but the Lowe's team needs to come up with ways to reinvent the company that do not include majorly compromising the satisfaction of their employees and customers."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs Palm Coast has a culture of a lot of chiefs and a couple of Indians. One in particular could only walk around with his hands in his vest and sneer down at the people under him. The person I worked with directly was a constant negative commentary on what the company had done to him and what he would like to do to the company. When I informed an ASM of his negativity and hostile workplace that he created in my life, I was the one that was immediately under the microscope. "
bad,"Customers are civil and easy to deal with, due to being personally-invested homeowners and people who DIY (Do It Yourself). Even Black Friday is manageable vs. other retailers due to friendly clientele."
bad,It's way too much for one person to do. No help from anyone. You are constantly running from one end to the other. The money is not that good for what you have to do.
bad,I worked for the warehouse located in Plainfield ct. and at first it was a great place to work and everything and everyone seemed great but as time passes you realized its not the best place. One of the big bosses is a jerk to certain people and nice to certain people they start off by telling you that they wont fire you for just any reason but they Look for every possible reason to get rid of you. They have a minimum of 100% performance that you need to have or you can get fired if you miss 1 day its a point and you have to work the full month after the day you miss to get rid of the point 10 points and your gone yet there still people working there that bave more than 10 points. Overall not the best place to work just being honest find something better.
bad,"Zero 'man management' skills. Managers needs come before those of the customer.  Quote ""if you don't like it you know where the door is"".  Very high turn over of staff."
bad,"The 3003 Danforth Avenue Lowes was nightmare because you have an egotistical management team. In my first, liked working for the company but the last two years, they went down hill. I would not recommend anyone to work at that particular location."
bad,"Great place to work if you like to stand around. I do not. "
bad,It can be a nursery school from time to time doing nothing but babysitting grown  people. Lets face it todays society is a lot of cry babies that you cant even look at with out offended them What happened to men being men doing what's right  so many managers stand around with their head in the sand afraid to say or do anything  because they will get in trouble. Corporate bullies are to blame  if you suck you suck that's all there is to it no rose pedals and flowers just the truth and if you cant take the truth stay at home
bad,"I had the bad experience of being a transfer from Florida to Philadelphia, which never adjusted my salary based on the lifestyle in Philadelphia.  in more than a year they exploited me with the heaviest work and took advantage of the low salary making me work overtime and train new employees with a better salary than me.  When I asked for a raise, they disrespected me and made fun of how I speak English.  I consider Lowes in South Philly to be racist."
bad,"I don't have a whole lot good to say about my experience at lowes, but I also don't have a whole lot bad to say either its just a company with a figurehead making strange decisions, which causes people to become unhappy working there."
bad,it's a decent place to work with ok benefits time off hrs are good my hrs are good at night but day shift varies I wish pay was better but I survive  fast paced work
bad,The people  You work with a great the management sucks they work to good workers to death and overlook the people that don't do nothing I wouldn't recommend it for a long term dub
bad,used to be a good company to work for now management is no good do not care about its employees. there is no home and work balance anymore.Management do not care about you
bad,"It was the most bias place Ive ever worked.Work ethic,and customer care doesnt count for nothing unless your in the gossip/manager pet clique,A good boss who respects hard work was not my 3year experience with my particular store."
bad,"I originally was hired on as a seasonal associate for the busy season and then later on got hired on permanently as part time (took forever to get put into a permanent position.) It used to be amazing in the beginning, everyone worked together and everyone got along. They even made it a point to make sure you got your lunch and breaks!  Somewhere along the way nobody wanted to help anyone and management got worse. All the people I worked with were cool on a personal level but not cool in a professional work level. Management at my store was terrible and never helped you when you needed it. AND you better use the bathroom when you first walk in because once you're there.. you're there. The new ceo has managed to turn such a great company to work for into something awful."
bad,"While the pay is nice for someone who is a single person, the pay is not enough if you have a family. Also, the rules are followed very loosely and managers and corporate follow rules very loosely when it comes to whether they like certain people."
bad,"Started out as a great company to work for but recently the new CEO has implemented changes that completely ruined the experience of working there. It used to be an employee and family based company, Now the new higher ups have completely taken away the home/work life balance."
bad,"If you want an hourly job that will help pay bills, its decent. Its not a hard job, but you want to be on the good side of the managers. Health insurance is expensive."
bad,"Staffing was poor and many times only one person for one or more departments. Management constantly demanding downstocking to be completed while at same time assisting customers who see the desperation in us. Archaic IT systems that few know completely how to use. Rotating daily shifts that could have you opening and downstocking at starting at 4AM, next days could be mid shift for a day or 2 then late shift (2-11PM+) all in one work week! Your body will be in a perpetual jet-lag type funk, and you never get used to it. "
bad,"You'll spend hours on your feet and if you don't have good shoes, you'll regret it. Management was horrendous to the point where one manager discriminated natural hair."
bad,"Typical work day involves managers hiding in the store to avoid customers, management is deficient, general manager can't make a decision, the AM's are like crabs in a bucket and that boils down to employees.  Incredibly high turn over of Customer service associates, due to poor management.  Corporate atmosphere is very different from 20 years ago.  Quality customer service is not a priority at Marquette Store.  Check it out for yourself- go in and try to find an employee to help you.  Saw people written up by management for not smiling/acknowleging manager while employee was helping a customer. Supervisory positions, the managers , have no skills and morale in the store is below pathetic.  Store sales sliding.  Corporate does nothing about it.  Managers have favorites.  Next to no one has more than 2 years experience.  Its a shame to see the store run into the ground by inept management creating a toxic work place."
bad,"My responsibilities changed on a weekly basis, we weren't given enough hours to cover the minimum department requirements, there was no time to train anyone and not even management knew what was going on half the time. It was a constant juggling act between what was supposed to be done, what we had the time/staff to get done, and which manager to disappoint."
bad,As stated my hours where cut by almost 50%. I asked for a transfer to another department and I believed I was never considered for my request. As my hours got reduced my work load increased.
bad,"Getting promoted was extremely difficult, the customers treated you like dirt, there‚Äôs no room for you to grow unless you kiss managements butt, but at least they pay well."
bad,Lowes doesn‚Äôt care about long term employees when they make too much money they are disposable. It doesn‚Äôt matter how you perform it‚Äôs all about how much you make. When I got hired I was told they call it Lowes for a reason
bad,"The coworkers are amazing and they really grow on you but the customers are awful and extremely rude. After working there for about 3 days I realized management was awful For anyone who has high anxiety wouldnt recommend. Some people didnt show me how to work things, had to figure it out on my own."
bad,Regular associate are usually good to work with but 95% of managers are terrible only 2 or 3 were decent. The big bosses cared more about getting a bonus than you.  If you get injured they do everything in their power to make you take the fall so they dont have to give workmans comp
bad,"Don‚Äôt care about your family time just their image as a company will replace you with independent contractor with no notice really or care "
bad,"Don't take a part time job thinking you will eventually get a full time job with them - it won't happen any time soon.  Part time hours can vary from 6 to 25 per week, its hard to budget for any consistent pay at this job and because the scheduling is never the same, you can't hold this job and another part time job..  Despite what they tell you when you start - there IS NO CAREER PATH planning.  I worked there 2 years and my manager never even asked me if I liked the job and wanted to advance in the company.  There are NO PERFORMANCE REVIEWS, only write-ups when you do something they don't like.  I loved the job but hated the way the company was managed."
bad,"Since the new CEO has taken over Lowe's, it has become a not os nice place to work. Every day you go into work wondering if you will have a job tomorrow. The morale is low at Lowe's and there is never enough help to assist customers, which is supposedly the new CEO's top priority.  I fear that they will eventually take away the employee discount which is the only real perk to working at Lowe's. Lowe's wants to become just like Home Depot and it is no longer a fun place to work."
bad,This has not been the best job for a few different reasons but I stay because it's hard to find work elsewhere. I would not recommend this job to anyone who can not handle stress or to anyone who wants an easy going work email. This job started as a great place to work with many career advancements but it has become a hostile work environment and is not somewhere I would like to keep working because of the lack of job security
bad,"Managers talk all day and aren‚Äôt helpful. Very unorganized, no training. Overworked and understaffed. Disrespectful managers, they think you are their personal slaves. They pretend to do their jobs effectively, but customers complain about management daily."
bad,"its extremely stressful and there is always drama. your schedule is never consistent, and its very hard to get a day off. Some people are nice but the customers can be very rude and make you feel worthless"
bad,They know the issue. When your system counts the days you haven't sold something and it's not on the shelf because it takes 3 to for weeks to get it back on the shelf. So it gets a velocity c reorder status. I had 30 to 40 items on my 0 on hand that were received and out of stock in just a couple weeks with none on order. Stupid system.
bad,"this store in hillsboro is a joke. Poor management, terrible pay, forced to work overtime, get reprimanded for calling out when sick. I would never recommend this as a work place."
bad,"Very very political environment. To the point were actual output, performance and other factors were relatively irrelevant to management. "
bad,"At this time I would rather not go into details. The company is in a flux that I am not willing to go into. "
bad,"Loved my coworkers but the pay and management was horrible. They play favoritism always. Can't move up unless you are in the inner circle. Maybe good for students or to have some type of income but not if you have a family to support. I don't recommend to work at the Waco Texas location, maybe others are better"
bad,I worked a total of 11 years for Lowe's and at one point was proud of what we were doing. New CEO comes in and takes company in a different direction and anyone with any knowledge or making any type of pay are slowly being eliminated.
bad,There are so many changes with the company that affects the way the employees can have excellent customer service.  Some of the management do not know what they are doing.
bad,"Working at lowes is stressful for absolutely no reason. They continue to cut departments making cashiers/customer service more responsible for running the store without any recognition or pay raise. The sales floor is understaffed so when they're unable to help us out we have to hear it from the customers.  At customer service you have to answer the phone, run a register and do online orders at the same time. Management gets mad if you need them to do their jobs. Cashiers are told not to talk to one another and taught to be yes men to every single customers even those who are scamming and stealing on a daily. While most managers/ head cashiers stay on their personal phones or hiding from work all day. All lowes cares about is how much money their employees can make them through sales and credit card apps. THAT IS IT!"
bad,"Everyone has something to complain about with good cause unfortunately. Many people have lost their jobs since Marvin the CEO took over. Putting a dark cloud over all Lowes employees, half of the managers are lazy, openly discussing their search for a better job. Everyone's work load has grown with no incentive, this job is good for 6 months to a year. Lowes just doesn't care about their employees."
bad,Good job if you‚Äôre just getting a first job. If you want a career it‚Äôs not the place. It could be a fun atmosphere but management won‚Äôt let you enjoy it. Too serious.
bad,"Look I worked at Lowe's for 2 years. At first the job was easy. It was laid back and the management was amazing. Then around 6 months into the job they started to change things, they wanted to be more like home depot. That was their mistake. They changed everything. You couldn't do or say anything without getting a warning. I got a warning for speaking up for myself and they saw that as defiance and violent. Honestly they feel threatened by anyone who tells them no."
bad,1st I was told i would be making 14.30 NOPE! I worked there for less then 6 months and the whole time I heard we will be better staffed soon... Well that never happen and when thing never got done they blamed me how am I supposed to do my job if you don't schedule enough people? Then they schedule multiple people over 8 in the am and but still get on my case about things not getting done.. Management needs to be WAY BETTER.
bad,"I work at Lowes as a loader. My job is simple but extremely exhausting. I have to carry and load heavy items (I.g. appliances, umbrellas, boxes with outdoor equipment, sinks and toilets). I also do carts(large parking lot) and stock items that customers return. It doesn't sound hard but trust me it is the hardest job to have at Lowes and what sucke about it is that management treats you like a dog. Now, this is how the chain works at Lowes. As a loader, you report to head cashier's and higher ups. Some of the head cashier's (not all) are absolutely awful. They are rude and don't care about you. To be honest, I enjoyed working as a loader but I handed in my notice a few weeks ago because I got tired of the management. Their tone when they ask you do something is very demotivating. They thinks it's easy but it's not especially when your working in the summer. I worked so hard every single shift  because one of the other loaders ghosts when he's not closing. He even told me "" if I'm not closing I don't work"". At one point, I snapped and handed in my resignation because the department manager couldn't make a good schedule if it hit him the face. He was a very nice guy to be honest but he should talk to the loaders more and see what needs to be fixed. There were two head cashier's that I loved working with because they let you work and they respect you. When I'm working with them I don't mind anything at work but the other ones are straight up rude and inconsiderate. One thing you won't regret working at Lowes are the other employees such as regular cashier's or sales associate and"
bad,"10 years ago when I started, employee's where up beat, happy. Now with this new CEO and his crew of bullies, positions are being done away, employee's are losing jobs and the associate's that make the over a million dollars in sales are having their salaries cut. Customers that are loyal to these associates don't like how the company is treating these associates."
bad,"They hire anybody and this creates incompetent and unreliable employees.  I was hired for part-time and, depending on the work cycle, would be scheduled to work 7-8 days straight.  I would get called to come come in at 5:45 a.m. because someone called out. many times.  Don't do it people."
bad,The management is mostly undertrained blood from a stone the beatings will continue until you do what we say.   They have good insurance and 401k if you can put up with the rude customers and even worse staff you'll be working with. There is usually room for promotions if you play their game but it is a good old boys club and they'll expect you to fit in if you want a promotion.
bad,"Lowes seems to have determined that the best way to treat everyone equally is to treat them all with complete disregard. The people with which I worked were above average. I found most of my fellow employees pleasant, helpful and cooperative. There were a few that preferred to keep to themselves or their close circle but no one was in any way hostile or difficult if I needed their help. The management, however, was at best dismissive. Information was impossible to get and that was always blamed on the computer. I was there for a temporary position for two months and after asking repeatedly, never found out who my actual supervisor was. Your schedule or position could be changed with no notice and any day could be your last."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with co-workers and helping customers."
bad,"You work terrible hours--in at 5 am one day, then late (till 11pm the next). You work nights, weekends, holidays. You almost never get Saturdays off, it's the busiest day of the week. It's a high stress retail environment, with unrealistic expectations. This company is getting their butt kicked by Amazon and Home Depot so management is putting lots of pressure on employees causing the good ones to leave."
bad,"Very nice associates to work with, the management is constantly pulled in different directions, no training what so ever!  Just the hiring process is difficult and no benefits, low pay.."
bad,"Needs to improve management skills and be honest to employees, provided more help and support to all associates, make sure they get a mentor and well trained to the specific role."
bad,They give raises bye group when you some people limited by work. Push all the work on certain people. The real don‚Äôt care about they Driver‚Äôs. Put all blame on delivery team  for all they mistakes.
bad,Communication is important on any job. Acknowledging those that work hard and not those you just like or favor. Getting rid of those that don‚Äôt work and help those that do.
bad,"Management was terrible and would write people up if they were late more than once, but they would routinely show up late and leave early and take extended lunches. The only way to advance was to suck up, rather than doing a good job."
bad,"Department Managers end up doing the heavy lifting for so much and very little by way of reward or recognition. Head Office and Management expectations are unrealistic. Its en endless trudge uphill for which you get very little."
bad,"Management doesn't listen to the employees."
bad,unfair labor practices are used members are now aware of flsa and are not followed Not a friendly atmosphere between hourly and salary associates would not recomend the job
bad,"In my 5 years I had 4 different store managers and ASMs rotated almost as frequently. The company has changed greatly and is more sales and customer focused then ever before, which is good. However they refuse to hire more then a skeleton crew for every department. So it's impossible to provide great customer service when you have a flooring detail your trying to help a customer put together for their home while other customers have product questions ,needs carpet cut and then management expects you to have your department completely organized before the store closes. This is while you only have yourself in the department your entire shift and still breaking adjacent departments and taking on their customers as well. The customers suffer because of the poor service due to the employees being stretched ridiculously thin. When management is asked for support they are sitting in their office or walking together around the store saying they are to busy (being a manager who tried to change that I can say that they were not to busy but didn't want to work or didn't know how to do the work). If you are lucky enough to get a manager to your department the manager says that they don't know how to perform the work they are supposed to oversee their associates doing. How can you manage something if you don't even know if its being done correctly or efficiently??? They also now have a program that we can not do anything but walk the store and help customers between 10am-2pm which if its dead like most Mondays-Thursdays is ridiculous because you are not allowed to down stock and clean up"
bad,"My Job there was great until they cut it in half. I now spend half days in paint department, mixing paints. When I first started working there it was a decent people oriented place. Over the years they changed managers many times."
bad,"Employer gave them stressful environment because of frequent understaffed and management did not recognize safety hazards. Someone will receive serious injuries if no safety hazard being removed or corrected. Also, management needs a change to hire the right employees for specific departments instead of hiring ignorants. Finally, the schedule is a bit strict so they don‚Äôt give you flexibility to adjust your schedule a"
bad,"Pretty good company to work for ,Not really flexible with your life . Would go from working mornings to night every other day. Prefer set schedule. Some management was very helpful some, Very judgemental and hard to work with."
bad,Management was awful. I almost got fired because the manager didn‚Äôt schedule me any hours for over 2 weeks. When I did get hours I worked around 10-12 hours per week. Would not work here
bad,"Without any reason they play with your job life..."
bad,"Management does not have your back. Although much documentation was done on negative behavior of cashiers, nothing was done and this behavior was allowed."
bad,"Forgetting about you on the sales floor or in heat of the day, ignoring head cashier calls and pages for overrides which frustrates customers and holds up lines, and uncaring management make the job frustrating and annoying."
bad,"The reason anyone should work here is because they are in a bind. Every Lowe's is different and the culture at the Belleville store is poor. Management will not work with your schedule and believe you should bend over backwards for them. Understaffing so they make budget and bonuses on the backs of the hourly employees is evident. There are people who have been working at this location for a very long time and make decisions based on personal agendas instead of merit. Again, work here if you absolutely have no other choice."
bad,"I brought quite a bit of sales experience to the sales floor, and in a short time proved that. But it was not appreciated, the position should be renamed to custodian/appliance sales. Because there is no value on sales at the top level at this location. You are constantly being sent to do other jobs leaving the department understaffed or no staff at all. Appliances  are a big ticket item that requires engagement of the customer not just standing around waiting for someone to say hey I want this or that. Top management seems oblivious to that, even when even the extended warranty‚Äôs exceeds expectations."
bad,"Lowe's is a company that is quickly going downhill with the addition of their newest CEO, who has cut hours across the stores in an attempt to raise profits/stocks for the company.  Works out for those at the top at the expense of those actually working in the stores.  Fewer hours and employees means more work spread out to fewer employees present on top of those employees getting paid less throughout the week due to cut hours.  Also, it is very difficult to move from part-time to full-time unless you're already hired in at full-time."
bad,"I really enjoyed most of my co workers but quiet a few of the managers don't listen to associate input or seem to actually care about them. Not all of my mangers were like this but 2 out of 15 isn't great. They are coping a lot of policies that don't really work from Home Depot' s failed ones. You don't get a lot of personal or free time outside of work. If lucky, you may get 2 days off in row ONCE a month. Most of time you MAY get 10 hours between shifts and spit days off is very common. As well as closing one night and coimng in the very day at 7 or 8 am, closing means you leave at 11 pm. So say goodbye to your personal life. Even if you tell them you can't work certain times or days, you will be scheduled on those days or times and they will not fix it for you. Awesome co workers, horrible policies, when it's even followed, and bad management who has no problem throwing associates under the bus."
bad,"I have worked for the company for 3 years and I have applied over a dozen times for positions and have gotten maybe 2 interviews and over 8 rejections without interviews at all. There is no coverage and they refuse to hire more people but also restrict overtime. If you‚Äôre good at something they‚Äôll keep you there until you die because there is no opportunity for advancement. Racism, homophobia and ableism as well go on in the workplace. Workers are rude , management doesn‚Äôt give a single thuck about us and nothing good has changed in two years. I‚Äôve seen too many good workers leave the place, workers that have worked there for decades. I‚Äôm disappointed in this place and angry that nothing ever changes. I can‚Äôt live off my pay and I‚Äôm tired of being verbally abused by customers and managers not defending workers when we are in the right regarding policy. They let customers return any kind of junk even if it‚Äôs past 90 days without a receipt and constantly say yes to things that are against policy. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being a corporate slave and I will quit once my managers reject my request to cut my hours because physically I can‚Äôt do it anymore. Being constantly left alone at the customer service desk AND expected to run the pick up desk when the person working there isn‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs too much for jack squat. This place will eat your soul. I will never work here ever again or recommend this place to anyone ."
bad,A typical day at work there consists of always hearing rumors about yourself and others. Even the older generation is completely sucked into it and tends to participate in the drama. Ideas and opinions are not liked at this place. If the manager doesn't see it is a good idea then it's not even an option or vote. These managers are jokes most of the time. They let you think you're going to become more only to blind swipe you and choose someone else.
bad,"responsible for managing controllable expenses, writing budgets, and leading employees. Responsible for setting store to sales plan on a weekly basis."
bad,"There is no specific job dicription or set of duties, they expect you to do things you‚Äôve never done before with little to no direction by management, your schedule rotates and is all over the place you have no time for family."
bad,"up until a year ago was a good company to work for. now they are headed in the wrong direction, everything based on meeting numbers. set targets that are unreaistic and expect you to meet them. never enough staff."
bad,"Management is very poor but is just a temporary position just to get by, no room for growth more like a second source of income. Nothing to learn from."
bad,"When I first started everything was great. Then a few months ago things started to go down hill. Management seemed to not care, which lead to employees no caring. Always hard to get a hold of a manager when needed. Very little communication from management about changes and needs."
bad,"I learned to just do as you are told, and then you do not get yelled at much and still keep job.  Most of management did not really know what they were doing."
bad,"As a loader, my duties were to push carts and load items into cars. They had me doing that, and also garden center work, pulling doors and appliances from the aisles for customers, covering cashier, and them complained when there were no carts...? They stretched me out for 10.23 an hour, and I was often looked at like less than because of my position."
bad,"Flexible hours, decent pay for the work, Tuition reimbursement for those in college. "
bad,"The start of my day on a typical work day begins with being micromanaged by upper management and assisting customers that are patient and cooperative and also customers that are irate and disrespectful. I have learned from working at Lowes that no matter how hard you work and give 200% of yourself and being a loyal employee in all the years of being employed at Lowe's you are not as valuable as they make you believe. The location of the Lowe's that I am employed with is employed with a majority of one ethnic background which makes it very difficult and uncomfortable.  The most difficult part of working at Lowe's is the constant changes from the corporate office and the lack of understanding of how it affects all the employees. The turnover rate with Lowe's is very high.  The company is quick to remove their employees that make higher wages and dedicated years of being a loyal employee.  Lowe's is not a reliable company to work for, they are unpredictable and unorganized.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting and meeting nice customers and at the end of the day of chaos being able to just go home and get some peace."
bad,"Management does not care about the floor employee. New CEO Marvin is also implementing a new policy that states if you‚Äôre off for 14 days or more, the system automatically terminates you. This is giving management an easy way to fire people they don‚Äôt like. They leave them unscheduled for two weeks and they‚Äôre gone. Every week a new contradictory policy comes out and you‚Äôre expected to know it."
bad,Delivery department management get stressed when sales associates over-promise in their commitments to customers. Makes for unstable schedule and long days for delivery staff. Seeing a lot of turnover in delivery staff as a result.
bad,"Well, I was on the stocking crew and we came in at 4:00am.  I didn't mind that since we were out of there by 12:30.  Some of the problem with being a stocker in the store I was in, was the fact we got blamed for everything.  You really felt like you were at the bottom of the barrel when the fact was, we ended up doing everybody's job.  We had to help customers if the person in the department wasn't around, we had to help various other groups do their work if they were unable to complete.  A lot of times there weren't people scheduled in some departments until later in the day so they could cut payroll hours.  The managers were never on the same page.  One manager would tell us one thing and another manager would tell us something different.  The managers were always pointing fingers at each other blaming other groups.  There is no accountability in that store whatsoever.  Attendance policy was a joke.  People called off left and right.  There was a person that missed over 30 days from march -april of last year, and he quit - they didn't get rid of him!!  Tough to go to another position unless u were a favorite.  Seems most managers were Lowes grown and never really out in the world.  Those were the ones that puffed out their chest and wanted to let you know they were a manager. Everyday something was changing.  A few days later, it would change right back.  I could go on but I am running out of room and it is getting late.  I truly hope all of Lowes is not run this way otherwise I would think they would have been out of business a long time ago.  I went to the store as a semi-retired"
bad,"Typical work day consist of a high stress environment where their are never enough workers, management ignoring customer complaints about the lack of coverage. Want to move up? Good luck make sure you are buddy buddy with all the managers, highly ""political"". Unable to do my job as a Head Cashier most of the time because I'm stuck on a register this means no one can get overrides from me, and I can't observe the cashiers to train them better. Most enjoyable part are my coworkers, but there is always some kind of scandal going on or similar drama issues being spread around the work place. If you expect to here anything that is planned, don't, they won't tell you about structure changes until the day of if at all. If you are a good worker expect all work to be given to you, best to just do bare minimum."
bad,Not a good place to work if you are use to certain benefits and culture  of working in a corporate environment.  No flexibility with schedule or working from home.  Didn't feel that work life balance was very important.
bad,"No tienen heater y trabajar en invierno ah√≠ es horrible."
bad,Depends on the store manager. I went through three managers in two years. The third one fired me for tapping a push cart with a forklift. That confirmed my suspicions about here looking for a reason to get rid of me. Don't understand since I was a million dollar plus sales person. Go figure.
bad,"I think Lowe‚Äôs coupd be a great place to work. I just think it depends on what location you are at. In my case, GWS is not the place to be. Great coworkers. Management needs some attention. The management at this location has a tendency to be very condescending."
bad,My store changed a few years ago and became a discriminatory and retaliatory culture. It developed a click that engaged in illegal activity and if you raised questions you were forced out.
bad,Unpleasant and stressful environment with poor leadership. Constantly shifting corporate focus and erosion of benefits to employees. Very negative feedback from store level management.
bad,The company sticks to standards of making profits. Most first line employees have a high turnover. no work/life balance fir Management. It is a great place to grow a thick skin. However i would say it is the most unhealthy place I've ever worked for
bad,"Worked there for a year, and it was a tough one. There are only two good manager's at the store, and the rest are not good people. Also the store manager has a temper so good luck with that. Also if you take it upon yourself to learn power equipment don't. You will notice that your workload will increase ten fold. The only good thing about that store are some of the employees are great to work with, and the ten percent discount. Well I do need to give props to the health insurance."
bad,"There were some good things about working at Lowe's: I had a fixed schedule, I was able to take off the days that I needed, and they reimbursed my college tuition. "
bad,they would over work their employees and pay the bare minimum. the company its self was sloppy and unorganized with no rush and no worries even though the store was rat and roach infested.
bad,"Well one never knows what they might be doing when the come in to work that day  Staffing is at a skeleton crew, so we do not have enough people to help all the customers."
bad,"This is not a good place to work, I‚Äôve only been here for a few months and like everyone in the bakery smokes weed , they talk about it to each other all the time and the bakery manager is dating one of the employees and if the bakery manager doesn‚Äôt like you, she will not give you very many hours, I‚Äôm actually looking for another job because I hate working here."
bad,"It is not what you know in this company, it is who you know.  Current Manager does not come out of her office, nor will she take customer calls, nor will she speak to customers who ask for her directly.  As such, you as the CSA take the brunt of the customers frustrations. "
bad,"Worked as a delivery driver at Lowe's in Allen TX and I'm telling you, it was BS my first week there. They don't care at all about their delivery team!"
bad,"Most likely you'll start out making a minimum wage, if there is a minimum increase requirement  by the state and you fall in that category then they count that as your annual raise."
bad,"I left Lowes for personal reasons. There was a family situation that was unavoidable, so for my family, I made the decision to leave. The company has undergone many changes and I hope it has become a better work environment."
bad,"District Manager treats people poorly.  Training for position very weak.  Not very welcoming to new comers to company.  Long hours with no acknowledgment for hard work, unless you call in sick and do nothing."
bad,"Management was non existent. Not enough employees to help customers, management wouldn't help you if you asked and they were standing next to you doing nothing. "
bad,They talk about being a family but in my opinion that not so cause in my family it's the most important thing right or wrong family comes first..i love helping my customers love where they live.
bad,"Once i could get the truck loaded and leave the store, it was me and my customers. This was great. As long as i was in the store, nothing but stress, aggravation with most of the managers, to sign off so i could start deliveries, stress with the load builder because the loads were never right or stacked and banded properly. My deliveries were for contractors, pro sales department at Lowe's, not making sure that there product was pulled and stacked properly so it could be loaded on truck and leave the store on time is bad business."
bad,"A typical day at work is clock in unload the truck, top stock, have your lunch and then go home"
bad,"Greet and assist customers along with duties such as stocking, receiving. Electrical, flooring and lumber departments. Measurement and estimates.  Management pays more attention to their ""buddies"" and their pockets.  Management (while employed there) could be very bias towards some more than others.  To achieve any promotion, a membership in the ""good ole boy network"" is a must. Culture is 50-50, some people are back-stabbers and some be considered as friends. Hardest part of the job was doing the same thing in the same department day after day. Forget about weekends and holidays. There are really no enjoyable parts to the job."
bad,"The seasons and day of the week really affect the work loads. Weekends are busy and customer focused.. Weekdays are slower and time is spent restocking and/or cleaning, zoning. "
bad,"Management is awful. I have one word for you, favoritism. You better hope that you know the manager personally or become good friends with them quickly. Cause if you don't, you're gonna have a terrible experience working there. Better just get close to the managers and suck up cause if you don't, good luck enjoying your job."
bad,"If you like having upper management that does nothing, and then tries to hold you accountable for working your butt off this is your kinda place.  There is no TEAM, just upper management that sit on there butts.  Store run on base staffing so Manger can make bonus, while floor staff is burned out and constantly turning over."
bad,The management is terrible around there and are not open to any ideas from anybody that would help make things more efficient. The atmosphere witin the store is terrible and there are never any employees scheduled to help any customers.
bad,They are understaffed and underpaid. Overwork their employees. Very secretive of things that effect their employees. The company overall has gone downhill over the years.
bad,"Favoritism, lies, and deceit is what you get at Lowe's. Don't plan on moving up unless you are a favorite. At that point, you can do whatever you want (literally) and not get fired. I was only late 3 times during the whole year I worked there and rarely called in, and yet I get forced to quit because my manager thought my school schedule was fake, and she refused my proof or talk with my school's admissions woman. I was already stressed and started to get a bit emotional, and she let another employee into the room with us. Completely unprofessional. They do not care about what you have going on with life at this Lowe's. Store manager is very fake and only cares about the numbers. I thought it was supposed to run like a family, just like they advertise. Don't waste your time with this Lowe's."
bad,"I work for Lowes as a seasonal employee with high hopes of becoming part time, someday becoming full time. while working there the first couple of months were great. I learned new things and enjoyed the people I worked with while getting the jobs assigned to me done quickly and accurately. after a few months when the managers got comfortable with me and knew I strived to get jobs done they stared taking advantage of me. I was given hours that I told them I was not able to work due to being a student, I got phone calls from them while I was in class asking me to come in and work. after getting treated the way I was I started to take up for myself and others did the same they decided it was time to let me go for no reason even though I was told repeatedly by my manager that I will be able to have a part time job with them. I can't say all Lowes are the same but the one I worked for worked me hours I said I couldn't work and also they would cut hours so short that I would only get 16hrs a week"
bad,The job itself is very good but management is discouraging they are not encouraging as long as you stay in the position management wants you in everything is fine but as soon as you want a change or advancement for yourself its frowned upon by certain leaders
bad,"inconsistent work schedule, could not make ends meet on the salary and the hours I was working. Never a chance for any type of job advancement nor any full time positions"
bad,"Some very good people work there.  Some very bad people work there.  Overall you avoid the bad ones if you can, and befriend the good ones.  Customers are awesome for the most part.  A few like to cause trouble to get discounts, but in general they are great."
bad,"There were a lot of cliques and managers are quick to play favorites. There is no job security and little opportunity for advancement because management offers positions that they can't give. Managers talk about other employees on the floor and are big to gossip. The ""open door"" policy they have implemented is just so that the managers can gossip about private business. Low morale, would only recommend for a summer job."
bad,Its a starting job but if you want to advance in your career don't depend on lowes. get in work a bit and move on with what you really want to do. The pay is ok.
bad,"Horrible management, unhelpful co-workers, low pay. Full time front end supervisors get $100 on their quarterly bonuses, managers get 1000+. It's basically trickle-down economics, corporate edition. It still doesn't work."
bad,"When I first started working at Lowe's over a year ago, we had 12 people on our overnight stocking team.  We typically worked 1 to 2 hours overtime just to keep up with all of the freight that came in.  When I quit last week, there was only myself and one other individual that they had just hired, on the overnight stocking team.  They have very poor and week management at that store."
bad,"There is no room for advancement, the managers do not care how the customers treat their employees.  There is no support from the managers, they will move you to an new area and offer no training, they will in turn not train you when you ask for training."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"management hires mostly outside of company and shows favoritism to those who gossip and socialize with management and other workers in earn more pay from those with experience and hard working ability. It is not a career, just a filler or pit stop in where you really want to be. The job can take a toll on your body and you will end up stuck there if you do not find something to replace it fast."
bad,Too late to redefine culture and value when competition is 5-7 years ahead; dysfunctional management provides zero leadership and tends to micromanage.
bad,Horrible hours for single parents. Has been many years since I worked there so things may be different now.I was taught to be knowledgeable of all departments. I handled the accounting for the store but was able to work where ever I was needed
bad,"Management typically works 60 hours or more. No home life, wives call themselves Lowe's widos. Management is hostile to say the least. Helping the customer was very satisfiying."
bad,"The thing I remember most about Lowes was that we were always cleaning but nothing was ever clean. Even though I was a Specialist and considered an expert in my field, I still had to fetch appliances off the top shelf of the warehouse, get dirty and then expected to greet customers and be professional. I did learn about other departments and what they did. I could write up an order in pretty much any department. I also learned how to run an installation, project manager, if you will. There are some coworkers who give 100% and there are those you give 20%, Sometimes the 20%ers are the ones getting the reward. There were some great coworkers and there were some that I would not give time of day to, but that could apply anywhere. Back when Lowes had commissions on big ticket sales, people would refund/rebill under another person's name or their own name and get the credit for the sale. Management did not care. ""Thems the Breaks"" attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer was thrilled with their new bath or kitchen and they came back to tell me. Very rewarding part of the job."
bad,"If you get a wonderful store and knowledgeable management team the company is wonderful to work for. Stores need better communication  skills, and updated computer systems."
bad,"I have no real answer to, I work long hours doing more than a salesman probably should, you try to help customers as best as you can, while at same time keeping dept clean, pulling install orders ect."
bad,"Managers and Head Cashiers are not professional, have poor customer service skills, and are never available when needed by employees.  No room for advancement no matter how much they say there is.  Once hired to a position, you are stuck in it unless you transfer to a different store."
bad,"Was not trained the right way had to learn a lot on my own by watching others. Was bullied on several occasions, manager turn the other cheek when some co workers did wrong."
bad,Was a cashier at a newly opened Lowe‚Äôs being as slow as it was there was nothing else for the other employees to do besides talk about each other behind their backs. Worst job I have ever had. Management also likes to be apart of the gossip. Favoritism at its finest. Not a professional environment. Wouldn‚Äôt waste my time if you are interested in coming in to actually work at your job
bad,The people are nice but training is haphazard.  Managers are overworked and don't always have time to help.  Most positions are part-time which doesn't do much to help pay bills.
bad,Too many immature employees flirting instead of working and texting each other throughout the day. Management looks the other way if you're part of the in crowd. Most of the employees have no construction or home improvement experience at all. The majority of employees still live with their parents so that tells you something right there.
bad,"Lowes is a place that cares least about the people who interact with its customers. Yes Lowes pays well per hour, BUT if you only work a few hours as a part time employee you may as well work for minimum wage. If you are one of few lucky enough to be full time then prepare to be over worked at all hours of the day. My store #0186 in Baton Rouge, the management was very disconnected from the needs of the employees. We barely had the tools to get the job done and were severely overworked. That had an effect on the customer experience. Lowes is a good job if you need a part time supplemental income, but do not depend on it for your livelihood."
bad,"no understanding, no teamwork, no communication, poor training, poor coaching, poor pay, messy environment, always felt uncomfortable, never felt welcomed"
bad,"stressful, poor scheduling and very demanding hours. "
bad,"A good place to work, but poor high level management.  Not a place to advance or grow a career.  No advance long term management potential.  There is a place for everybody at Lowe's, but Lowes is not for everybody"
bad,"Lowe's is a largely leaderless organization that does not value creative thinking or new approaches to longtime problems. Rather, Lowe's retains a cookie-cutter demeanor that hampers its day-to-day employees. "
bad,the job work was very normal and physically acceptable as you became more aware of the work process...the only downside to the job was the amount of emphasis put on doing the job in a fast paced manner which at times would become unsafe or not as safety conscious as employees needed to be to perform effectively and safely.
bad,"Lowe's was once a company that cared about it's employees. About 3 years ago, that all started changing. They started cutting positions left and right. They started cutting benefits."
bad,"They pull you in with promises of advancement, and the ability to grow and learn."
bad,"Lowes is a great first job for someone in highschool or looking to get their feet wet in the employment world, but it is not a company to stay with long term if you want to have a family/life outside the company and want to be paid what you are worth."
bad,Not a very stable place with terrible leadership and even worse support system. Nevertheless provided the tools or support to be successful in your position. Very strict set of rules to follow
bad,terrible management; hours were never correct; worked father than was expected; had to pick up other peoples messes; unattainable expectations; management turnover due to stress.
bad,"Lowes is a cut throat company that does not follow federal law regarding VETERANS "
bad,Great medical benefits  and 401k but it is working for a corporation and the workers are not important but replaceable. In my location there is no ability to move up in company.
bad,Lowes is a faced pace work environment but lacks in a lot of areas. No leadership qualities. Turnover rate for any manager is high. No time to get used to store managers or any because they never stick around. I went through 6 store managers and 12 assistant managers n 11 years. Favoritism is large at this store. Untrustworthy environment. You get no advance pay every year like they say you will. I was stuck at my pay rate for 5 yrs just to hear I was topped out and will no longer get raises.
bad,"Yes you get full-time work and you get paid fairly well for your efforts. But that's where the praise from me ends. No opportunity to advance anymore since they restructured and took away the Department manager role. The managers that are left are overworked. No balance between work and life. You're expected to dedicate your time and health to the job, the schedule is on a rotation so once a month you work 14 out of 16 days with split days off at opposite ends of the week. No weekends off. You get Christmas day and Thanksgiving day off."
bad,"Lowe's like to present its self as a family company, this is not true. The people in management clearly have now real training or knowledge of what it is to manage or even communicate properly."
bad,Lowe's put too many changes in place without being prepared for the rollout of them. Computer systems are far behind where we are technology advanced.
bad,"If you want to work every Holiday, Late nights and weekends, get written up if you use a sick day and live stressed out and hate your job this is the 1 for you."
bad,"I only look forward to going to work for the people. "
bad,"They staff as little as possible, so you are usually rushing from one customer to another, sometimes one individual would be covering three departments. They were slashing staff when I left, so it must be really hard to provide good service."
bad,I would not recommend working their to anyone.they place too high of wants on their employees and won't hire more to help. They lie to the upper management about how stores are looking and safety is poor for it being so important to them.
bad,"There are too many different management changes, poor or lack of supervision and schedule changes frequently. No one was concerned about the lack of proper heating at work location"
bad,"This was a night shift job and only part time, however as you continue in the job during the holidays it will go from part time hours to full time hours with overtime depending on the number of other stockmen and the amount of freight. additionaly you have a 6 month probationary time before you are considered for full time..which may or may not be totally ignored."
bad,Management over managed to many chiefs not enough people actually working or staying in their departments. Expecting you to get up in high places while restocking heavy items and waiting on customers in store at the same time. Not enough hands on training more computer training in departments. Working with moody or bully sales associates who do not want to be there. No one there to keep employees in check.
bad,Customers complain all day long that the lines are long and there is never enough staff. We are running so short handed that there is no way we can even take a lunch break on some days. We are constantly covering other departments. The management is so overworked and overwhelmed they are no help at all. It didn't used to be like this. It all went downhill when they laid off all the middle management and half of the upper management!! They have done away with all fun activities. We used to have cookouts and potlucks all the time. We are no longer allowed to do any of these things. We close at 8pm on Sunday and are required to stay until 10pm.
bad,"I loved working with the customers and other employees. The upper management was non-existent, when they were, all they did was complain. No support from where it counted."
bad,Management didn't care about its workers and never tried to help with any situations such as hours and or a needed day off for personal problems.  Also get written up for being only 5 mins late constantly.
bad,"My typical day at Lowe's usually began with me arriving in the afternoon to find my department totally destroyed. As soon as management saw me, they would start telling me what I needed to do that night as if I hadn't already spent several years doing the exact same thing. Afterwards, myself and another co-worker in my department would rush to get as much work done as possible before said co-worker had to leave for the night. At this point I was usually left to my own devices, assuming management hadn't scheduled someone to close with me. Most nights were a mad rush where I had to bounce between tasks that included: restocking, helping customers, answering constant phone calls and eventually cleaning up my department. What did I learn from my time at Lowe's? I learned that no matter how nice you are or how hard you work, management will only remember you for your mistakes. Speaking of management, they would usually leave me be unless they needed something done and were difficult, if not impossible to find when I actually needed their help. If you want an idea of what the workplace culture at Lowe's is like just imagine if Walmart sold only home improvement supplies and you won't be far off. The hardest part of the job was when I was forced to work with someone who was obnoxious or incompetent. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help genuinely nice people find what they were looking for. Lowe's is an okay place to work temporarily if you're a college student or a retiree. I wouldn't bother applying if you're looking to earn a living wage though."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Management from top down is ineffectual and only seem to care about #s and not people. My HR lady was great though, management needs to learn from her!!"
bad,"The upper management does not communicate well, lack or professional courtesy or integrity, lack of trust, fear of job security. Long work days, expected."
bad,"Poor staffing, random schedule, little free time, little flexibility to swap shifts, high stress with low pay. The managers are nice but dont see what is going wrong, good people leave and lazy people stay."
bad,"Started the day early to attempt getting ahead of the chaos. Some days were better, and more productive than others. I did learn a lot from this challenging experience. Many employees were there due to not having the skills, or academics to be in a higher quality position with a more sophisticated company. Others were there because they like the tight structure, and can basically check-out and still appear to be working. The culture was a mixed bag of committed, self-starters, to a few select employees hiding out in another dept. to pass the time. The most difficult part of the workday was attempting to get other employees to help in the areas they needed to contribute in. Also, management ranged from caring and good individuals, to ego-centric, task masters; not wanting any feedback, or opinions when issues erupted."
bad,"This place is horrible to work for. Management does not care about you or your complaints. But don't get a complaint because you will be written up. Extremely understaffed workplace. The staff has either been there so long they just don't care, or the staff is still so young and immature that they don't care either. This job will turn you off from ever working retail again."
bad,"I enjoyed working @ Lowes until there were major corporate cutbacks and the current management team was put in place.  In less than a year, they destroyed everything good about working at Lowes.  Employees are leaving there in droves."
bad,Its a okay gig for someone who's young and/or still in school and is looking for extra cash. not the best job but it is something and most of the workers are friendly
bad,"Not enough staffing and back up from management to do your job.  Constantly pulled from one department to another for lack of staffing."
bad,Most department managers were over their head vis-a-vis necessary job knowledge. Management also seemed more interested in make work meaningless programs versus meaningful customer service. Very little expressed appreciation for work that associates performed.
bad,"over worked understaffed , corporate rotation of schedule leaves a toll on the body. Sometimes a fun place to work but since all the management cuts leaves it a little difficult to be a happy work environment"
bad,Management will not help you when you need it most. they tend to forget about you. the employees that work there are nice but the managers just look over you.
bad,Management would all give different answers when asked a question. To be such a big company it has to be the most unorganized and unprofessional company I've ever worked for. Unload crew is scheduled 25 he's a week your lucky to get 20 hourly pay is good but when get scraps for hours it comes out to minimum wage for the most physically demanding job in the store. Be prepared to unload alone if your crew doesn't show up management only cares when it gets closer to closing time because they are salary
bad,"No room for advancement, bad scheduling, no workmans comp, untrained employees, catoic, stuck it out as long as possible. No Hr help, job losses for employees with over 10 yrs. corporate is eliminating full time jobs so they don't have to pay benefits"
bad,"After being excited to work for a different Fortune 500 company, my enthusiasm waned dramatically when faced with the realities of the day to day ridiculousness of the expectations of my so called management team. I was continually over scheduled, to the point of incurring DOT violations. After the location had to pay $2000.00 in fines, they tried to modify the schedule not always succeeding. Finally was fed up with trying to accomplish the near impossible, gave 2 weeks notice and moved on."
bad,"If you are looking for a company with job security and the ability to advance, please look elsewhere.  I worked for Lowes for more than 10 years, and then one day suddenly my position was eliminated.  No warning.  They are continuing to do the same with other positions."
bad,"They posted my job while I was still on FMLA leave. They then forced me to quit or be fired. Loved my job, but management did not agree with each other or have a common view. Too many managers, too many opinions. I was great at what I did and provided detailed training for my role when no one else could. There was no training material available from internal resources either. Sad it didn't work out, but there was no opportunity for me to advance within the role. Disappointed at how it ended, but happy for the experience gained."
bad,"Previous Department Manager with 8 years of retail management experience who got displaced through the restructure. Got replaced by some who had no experience and no repore with the employees or customers. Almost impossible to get any management position now. I had to sell my house, get demoted and move in order to keep my job and benefits with the company. Very difficult and expensive move. No assistance from the company even though they were the ones who dissolved my position and were making move. I have faith that things happen for a reason but there is no loyalty to the ones who have carried the weight of the company on their shoulders to make things happen for them. This has been so difficult and depressing because when you keep getting rejection letters and no interviews or offers, you just want to roll over and quit. It is what it is but I had to uproot my whole family and start all over."
bad,"you cant move up you doing the same job all day, management is poor and the pay is bad. the want to work you to death but do not want to pay you for the work."
bad,"I was a seasonal employee and was told I would be hired on full time once season ended and would get my raise. I got a ton of great reviews from customers, was offered other jobs, and when season was over I was told I was being let go. I do not trust the management at this store."
bad,"was them them 5 years too long. Treat employees like mud, they are never used to the employees potential. Low wages n laughable raises. No room for advancement unless you like smelling,      ,   while your kissing it. Its all about $$$$$$$ to corporate. Big huge bonuses for managers only, recent changes have seen a lot I'd good people  hard workers laid off n let go. This company is  not family or employee friendly, spend your money elsewhere, big box stores are not your best pricing or service."
bad,"I was lied to about what job I was to be doing, work average of 60 hours a week, ruined my personal life.  The managers are very young, everybody talks trash about everybody.  The benefits are great."
bad,"business model is failing and has been for many years, care less about the employee and more about the money. it seems like a simple process and lowes just hasn't caught on."
bad,"I used to love my job.I loved the people I worked with and I loved the company. We recently restructured and it's not over yet. The morale is low, there's no staffing, and the management is poorly trained. I have had almost every position available for this company and I used to bleed Lowe's red and blue but not anymore. I have friends spread out through the company, and these occurrences are not localized. They have great benefits and pay really well, but sometimes the pay is not worth the stress that comes with the job."
bad,Management were unprofessional in handling and disciplining violent and negative behavior with staff. Receiving clerk constantly gave wrong routes and customer information making daily duties difficult.
bad,"Job has its benefits if you're desperate and need a position to tie you over, but don't expect to advance as the company is cutting back upper level positions and only the favorites get the better positions."
bad,I am a currant employee with Lowe.  I have worked as a specialist in flooring and kitchen cabinets.  Now Appluances. I loved my job 3 years ago when I was hired.  Now I am scared to say the least.  The corporation up on the ladder forgot who got them there.  Now there is to much stress not enough help and no job security.  I will be looking for another job with another company.
bad,"This would be a job that I would only return to if I really needed a job (then I would seriously think about returning).  The pay was awful, no benefits, and some of the managers could really use a class on how to treat, and respect others."
bad,the front is not the ideal place to work. Chaos is what I think of it . For weeks the weekly schedule changed daily. If you got a day off then you were called in because someone else called out.
bad,Corporate changes made in recent months have made a lot of employee truly disappointed and disillusioned.  What once was a great working team has now been ruined by decisions by people not present at location.
bad,"Exactly as said, in this company you tend to be expected to commit everything to your work and not have an outside life. All of these request are done at little to no pay. Had potential to be a great company but that is lost in the expectations without pay to back them."
bad,"On a daily basis Lowes provided an unsafe work environment. A job at Lowes seems as if it was meant to be temporary due to lack of promotion opportunities and teamwork. When I worked at Lowes the majority of my management staff were self centered and only cared about their job security, instead of focusing on how to efficiently perform daily tasks."
bad,My job was supposed to be very easy but the management made it so difficult for me. The management was very favoritism which is why I left Lowes because I didn't see any opportunities coming my way. I'm a very fast learner and I still wasn't able to move up.
bad,"Lowes is a good place to work if you are in need of a seasonal job and not looking for something permanent. The pay is good and so is the vacation time that they offer. However, there is no room for advancement and Lowes has cut out some employees jobs."
bad,"Bunch of young inexperienced managers, inadequately prepared to supervise people and manage business."
bad,"Management has been running around like chicken with their heads cut off. The turnover rate at the specific store I worked at is terrible. They schedule you for a ridiculous amount of days when you were hired on for Part Time work. The job would be ideal for someone who is looking to make a career there. Like most retail jobs, the training is minimal but the only issue is that they expect you to be experts in the department that you're in. But that's kind of hard to do when you've had maybe one or two days of training."
bad,Management would forget that I was outside for long periods of time when it was extreme weather. Didn't really learn much from the store. Other employees were fun to talk with and get to know. Trying to stay warm outside when it was too cold to be out for long periods of time. Meeting the people and helping them find what they needed.
bad,"Very dusty , unclean environment.  Company claims that following standard operating procedure is important, but people game the system, and laziness is rewarded, while honest hard work is punished."
bad,"On boarding and development is not anywhere near other big brand companies.  Lowes rolls out now programs in which they think will help with development and employee engagement.  However, they do not access the process nor do any of the management actually get involved to see what opportunity might arise.  Management is no where near par when it comes to driving a business forward in today times.  as well as adapting to working with the next generation."
bad,"Large company with good pay and benefits. That is the only pro. Large disorganized company that spews profits away on the only thing that matters to them. The customer. You will be squeezed of every last drop of passion you had in life bending over backwards but it's never enough... Then they eliminate more positions, cut back more hours each quarter and expect more. Bonus structure is a joke, they move your ""target"" each quarter to make it nearly impossible to make any bonus money. A lot of great people I know work for the company still but it's a sinking ship. Just look at the Depot market value vs Lowe's. Do yourself a favor and find a company that values it's employees as much as the customer."
bad,This job is not the best. You really have nothing to do all day. They want you to hit very low goals so you are stuck doing nothing all day. I don't reccomend this job to anyone who wants to stay busy and contribute. This job should be part time.
bad,"Worked for Lowe's who's motto is to help Customers ""Love where they live"". I gave this Company my full effort as well as passion to better the workplace in general. always stayed until the work was done, as well as always helping in other areas in the store to help out in any way I could. Only to be walked out with no real explanation other than it's best for the Company to part ways. I was devastated and left with a pit in my stomach, wondering where all those awards I was presented with for my Customer service were not even remembered. Make Customers, Love where they live, but employees can't feel secure with Management even after getting recognized."
bad,"I enjoyed the coworkers and helping the customers.  The change in management and corporate policies has been detrimental to staff moral.  Due to Corporate restructuring, Lowes has lost and will continue to lose good employees."
bad,There are only a small amount of people in management that actually care about the employees. The environment is stressful and a large amount of the other employees will treat you like trash.
bad,"Frustrating day to day experience, and very little opportunity to move up in the company. Not enough employees, everyone is stretched to the max covering 2-3 departments. Some shifts I work almost entirely alone doing $3000-5000 sales a day with little acknowledgement. Management routinely scrutinizes the way the store looks, and does little to nothing about it themselves. Highly disappointing work experience."
bad,Management is horrible.  The only reason I stayed working there was for the benefits.   They don't protect or care about their employees.  Profit and bottom line is all they care about.
bad,"Not Good, Bad discriminatory people. Stay away. Races/ Bulling. I was a victim of their behavior. Good thing I waste only 10 month with this monster people. Thank God!"
bad,there was some really good benefits But you worked so much you didnt have time to enjoy/utilize any of them. you worked from sun to sun down most days barely had your weekends off
bad,"Wow.. The new restructure that Lowes has rolled out this year was a huge sign that the ship is sinking. You cant just re arrange the chairs on the deck of the titanic and think that's going to fix the issues. Lowes claims they are about people, and taking care of their team members but that couldn't be further from the truth. They botched the restructure and employees found out on the web site as information was leaked months prior. How would you feel if you knew you were getting fired because you could see your severance package coming from ups store, but as a store manager I  looked you in the eye for 1 month and said I knew nothing because I was forced to sign a non disclosure... Then they just rally everyone in a all store meeting and I say to the people we have to evolve to stay ahead and were sorry we had to fire good people. I'm sorry but that's not good enough to me.. Only time will tell but they are not who they say they are and that's the truth. Its a job not a career, but it will pay the bills if that's what you need.... I have seen this over and over in my time and the restructure to trim the fat. We had to evaluate each manager and it was just a matter of who I liked I kept. I was able to determine an employees future some that had 10-15 years experience with the stroke of a pen. I just kept those I liked best... Is that where you want to end up?"
bad,Underpaying job for the amount of work requested for each position. Stores are always under scrutiny for the work done each day. Not a professional environment
bad,"most enjoyed when accomplishing the task at hand"
bad,"With all the restructuring going on right now, it is not the place for a career. Part time or seasonal, yes. The benefits are minimum. And pay is not that great."
bad,"The hours are decent but are always changing, never have the same days off. Lack of on the job training, both in department, and working with the computer system Genesis. "
bad,"Offered an opportunity with a great package. Relocation was nice, but follow through for an opportunity for my spouse was not provided. The opportunity was promising until reorg after reorg created an unstable environment.  Moral was low but spirits were high because being employed with several projects on the docket meant value added to projects and experience."
bad,Never know when she is going to find something stupid to fire you for  Stupid reasons. She has a 97% overturn rate .The store has gotten rid of all most all of there fulltime employees for part time who dont know anything about there departments.
bad,"Recently Lowe's tossed all their department managers to the curb and replaced them with 5 ""zone managers"" hired from the pool of the desperate downsized. At my store, they seem to be proud in advancing those with the least experience and qualifications. Hire the 27 year old with a master's degree in communications versus any of the other DMs who have years of experience. "
bad,"They treat you like a number and never want to give you time off for anything. They only allow you to miss 7 days a year and even your sick days count against you. You are always in a department by yourself and a lot of work is out on your to finish. Management does little as they can and since they have got rid of department managers, no one has any structure or guidance."
bad,"I absolutely loved what I did, and the customers and co-workers. We truly were like family. The downside was the management staff. There were different rules for different employees depending on your relationship with them. They say they have an open door policy, but it's so open that when you do have a problem or complaint they don't show discretion and don't adhere to their own policies of confidentiality."
bad,"The work is not difficult at Lowes, but you are not valued as an employee and can be used as a excuse for management's shortcomings. The company uses antiquated computer systems and expect you to make up for it's shortcomings."
bad,"LOWES problem is management.  They are happy to give you more responsibilities.  As long as they don't have to pay you more for it. lol!  "
bad,This company has changed in the 27+ years I was there.  The last 8 not for the better.  I hope the individual contributors soon get a voice and are able to make more of a difference.
bad,the people you generally work with are pretty good. money is terrible for the amount of work they expect. entry level job.
bad,"Could be a great place to work with a few changes. Company tries to hold employees down to part time status. And they hire from outside more than promoting from within. Also hours can be very hard to come by, especially in slow times of the year. Management at my store at least was very underwhelming. In some cases hard to find and unwilling to help. Office politics run rampant. If you're not in with the ""in crowd"" good luck getting anywhere. Lowes may be great, but my location isn't all its cracked up to be."
bad,Most of the employees at the last Lowes I worked at were very unfriendly towards one another. Other stores were much better
bad,this job was great too but the only thing is management was not fair to some of the employees there was no cross training as was told when everybody started this new Distribution Center
bad,"Working for this company was a challenge, because employees are micromanage and not allowed to work as a team. Management always would give an opinion without knowing all the facts. There was no trust between management and the associates, because in my opinion I was a better problem solver than Management. My focus was on the customers, because without them there wouldn't be a Lowe's."
bad,"I would come to work to be work in the hardware department. I would make keys and help customers find what they needed. Late at closing it didn't matter if your area was clean because you weren't allowed to leave until the whole store was clean. some would take advantage so others would pick up slack. If you work part time is mandatory that you are available minimum Friday evening, a full shift Saturday and a full shift Sunday. If you couldn't do that every week you would be let go. You were also required to take lunch breaks whenever they saw fit. Many times I was told to go to lunch early in the morning bc it was convenient for everyone else. Everyone is required to fill out an availability sheet and they would still assign you to work when you stated you were unavailable"
bad,If you get offered a summer spot great you should take it but once the summer is over run and do it fast as soon as all the summer staff leave the place becomes a living nightmare for the regular staff
bad,"Lowes would serve great as a second or part time job. For people that have open availability and don't mind flexible scheduling, working weekend, and holidays. Management is salary based and work no less than 10 hours a day. Lowes is staffed based on sales and how well the store is doing. Not by the best number of associates needed to make their customers shopping experience enjoyable, especially after the hours of 4pm."
bad,You are just a number to them and will replace you as soon as they fire you. Everything is a political game if you're liked you're safe. HR is no help they will let you out to hang yourself for anything.
bad,Lowe's is a decent company to work for. The pay is good for retail and the benefits are good as well. However at the store level the work environment is toxic. Management is full of people on a power trip or those who don't want to do anything now that they've reached a certain level. Employees are constantly asked for feedback on how things are being run but are nearly always ignored if the answers aren't what management wants to hear. There is also a severe problem with understaffing. This is an issue in all retail stores but at Lowe's it seems to be significantly worse. Managers also regularly practice retaliatory scheduling. If you request a weekend off don't be surprised if you don't get another one off for 6 months.
bad,Most of the equipment is non functional; staff given unreasonable demands; little to no regard for staff with disabilities; staff were made to be outdoors in 90 degree weather for over 2 hours with no breaks in between.  Staff who were 60 and over released after season.
bad,Upper mngmt. Only worried about herself. Employee very down to earth and social. Schedule to change on a daily basis. Understandably a multi billion dollar corp. But your only a number not a person.
bad,Good place to work if you are young and just starting out. You can make it a career if you want. It is not run like any other retail. Not sure how they are successful. I would not suggest this to anyone that comes from other retail.
bad,"A typical day at work was unsatisfactory, very complacent atmosphere. There was not any opportunity for advancement in your career. The amount of work for the amount of pay was unfair."
bad,"I worked as a manager and was required to maintain several departments at one time which wasn't the bad part it was just the quality of management that they hired and the way they treat the customers and employees.  To me working with the public you have to be compassionate and caring no matter what field it is even in retail.  The management and some workers were so rude and mean I could not take that type of treatment towards other. You also had several people that would stab you in the back any time as long as it meant they would move up and to me if that is the case I don't need the job because to me it is more important to be a hard worker and earn my advancements not by stabbing people in the back, And when it came to your family they were last and work was first."
bad,"Required to respond to customer inquiries and support them throughout their shopping experience including promoting customer loyalty plans and/or extended protection/replacement plans where appropriate. Duties also include processing customer sales and returns by operating a cash register, handling internet and pick-up orders, looking up merchandise information for price matches, and providing assistance to other team members as needed. Also responsible for addressing customer complaints over the phone and in person. Expected to maintain a safe and secure work environment by conducting daily safety reviews, noting hazards, keeping store areas clean and organized, and monitoring for potential theft or security risks. The management of the location i work at plays favoritism, they are not flexible for school or when an employee gets sick. Management also told me I was not allowed to file a injury report when I was injured at work because they did not want to ruin their no injury streak."
bad,"It's a great place to work. But the cashiers and there managers are put under WAY to much stress for what the job pays. Also, even though your co-workers are much older, the drama is still a lot like high school. Management is not too bad but you can tell they are stretched WAY too thin."
bad,"A selective of my former coworkers were genuinely considerate. The managers were the total opposite. They don't know how to convey a message properly, and they come off brash ."
bad,"management is very ""clicky"" you are either liked or not and everyone knows. Best assistant left for other opportunities he was the only one that knew anything and treated associated with respect"
bad,This company will chew you up and spit you out.  There is a complete lack of respect for hard workers and zero recognition for those that make the difference.  The only way to get anywhere with this company is to stroke the egos of those above you.  Exact opposite of what they tell you.  Favouritism runs rampant at Lowes and if you doubt this simply pop in to your local Lowes store and ask a few of the customer service associates (if they dare be brave enough to tell the truth)  They are extremely biased and rule with a very high handed technique.  Beware of this company. I know many top dogs here and they are all very sneaky deceptive and regularly put on a total fa√ßade.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
bad,"beware, what they don't tell you during any of the three interviews is that the cashiers job is also to clean the public toilets.. disgusting for minimum wage job.. if you want a janitorial job you can get top dollar doing that.."
bad,i have worked for lowes for 4 years. i loved my job at first. then as the years went on i started seeing less and less chances to move up in the company. management only cared about getting a sale. no mater what kind of work load they put on you. there was nights i worked 14 hrs back to back. with no complainants. thought it would show them i was willing to do what it took to move up. but sadly my hard work went un noticed.
bad,"Working at Lowe's is an interesting experience. Some good days, and some not so good days. The management staffs the store with as few people as possible and expect the same amount of productivity while changing hours at a moments notice. The people help make the day easier though. Coworkers that sympathize and relate make it much more pleasant as you cooperate to complete the arduous tasks."
bad,"You can never do enough even when you are great. Management treats you as though you are garbage unless they need you."
bad,"Long days, no proper training. Pay is great. Benefits are great. Coworkers were awesome, management left alot to be desired."
bad,It was working at a hardware store. Not a lot to do but sell hardware. Sometimes I sold a lot of hardware. Somtimes I sold not a lot of hardware. It's a great job to have while looking for work.
bad,"the management running lowe's do not know what they're doing they do not care about their employees."
bad,"The work was challenging. Gruelling long days and nights that required not only sales on the floor but maintenance such as washing floors, moving shelves and displays, restocking products, inventory and assisting in other departments because the store was under-staffed."
bad,Very short staffed and Management is difficult to work with. They pride themselves on taking care of their employees better than the other box stores and that may be true at their other locations but not at this one.
bad,"Pay was the only thing that was keeping me there.. worked more than full time, management was very unprofessional, and coworkers were very angry."
bad,"TURN OVER AFTER TURN OVER..THEY CANT KEEP STAFF AND SEEM TO PRIDE THEMSELVES WHEN THEY ""FIRE"""
bad,"The management at Lowe's cares only for the bottom line. They overwork the employees,they have little concerns for their well being or safety.The HR manager lacks people skills. He ridicules employees if an issue is brought up to him."
bad,"Staffing is to thin, not enough employees to help customers. also prices are just a little high. quality is good but this market is filled with the google and find a better price. lots of home inprovement stores out there."
bad,"Terrible Company to work for, Management is more worried about their bonus than the employees"
bad,"not to bad of a place to work for. turn over is extremely high, lots of hours involved. I just enjoy working with people. Helping customers find what they need to do there projects."
bad,"In training we were taught company policy on returns of custom designed items. We were taught that the policy that these items, such and custom tinted paint and custom designed window blinds were nonrefundable. If a customer chose to question a manager about this policy, the manager accepted the nonrefundable items. This is a blatant disregard of company policy, and makes the employee trying to follow the policy look foolish. "
bad,"hardware and tools was fun.  I was in my natural element.  Helping customers solve their projects made my day.  hardest part of the job was keeping, or trying to keep, the department as opening day ready as possible."
bad,"A typical day at work as a seasonal employee or weekday/weekend ""team"" member at West Sacramento is not having any direction, being literally yelled at by management for things that are not within your control, and not being trained on anything properly. "
bad,"Challenging work environment, culture of ""who you know.""  Lacking direction as far as a 1 to 3 or 3 to 5 year strategic/tactical plan.  Very diverse solution that is heavily, heavily interfaced.  TCO for store solution is very expensive.  Too, too top heavy, organization could be streamlined from the top down."
bad,"A typical day for me was to arrive, clock-in, and for the next 4 hours be the only person outside collecting carts and helping customers to their vehicles. After my lunch when the flow started to die down, it was an enjoyable work environment. The break room was full of drama, and management was obviously unequipped to deal with this. I learned to give it 100% even when you are tired as a dog. The real joy that comes from the job is meeting new customers, but even more so, having customers return because of how well you treated them. The hardest part of the job was finding another co-worker to assist you with manual labor. Of course, every department is different. Only getting scheduled 15 hours per week is hard on your bank account too."
bad,lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo fue aprender a operar el montacargas concapacidad de 4 toneladas.
bad,Driving manager would send you in areas with weight restrictions on bridges that my truck far exceeded.He didn't care and just wanted product delivered.Not worth the fine or possibly losing my CDL
bad,"Doing the right thing and being there for your workers goes overlooked, they cator to their favorites, they will purposely try and get you fired if you are not liked by cliques"
bad,Many unhappy co-workers working under really unhappy managers.  Horrible and random work hours and scheduling.  Not a place for women.  Paradise for suck-ups.
bad,"Through the application and orientation process, the company offered competitive pay,  good benefits, training, and reported ample means of pursuing career advancement within the company. What is not mentioned is the specific requirements for advancement, which almost universally include some level of secondary education which is not only unpaid, but also nearly impossible to obtain due to the company's schedule requirements. All full time employees must maintain open availability 7 days per week, from 1 hour before store opening to one hour after closing (5am to 11pm in my area)."
bad,Great start place but there is really no way to move up in a career field there unless you know the right people. There is a high rate of people quitting because of poor treatment by managers.
bad,"Horrible place to be employed at.  Management does whatever they want, when they want.  They pretend that employees voices matter when all that matters is what management wants and they do not care about their employees.  They do not know how to go about action plans.  They say they will help you improve and then do nothing to help employees succeed."
bad,A decent job with decent pay for lower end workers. Typical retail environment. Management lacks in certain aspects of the job.
bad,the company doesn't care about the employees or the customer. all they are worried about is the money you can make for the company. if they feel you aren't making enough for the company they get rid of you and find someone who will do the job for less with less experience.
bad,Very fast paced. Gained a lot of experience. Well diverse business.
bad,"Lowe's has a growing number of Corporate Offices or ""Customer Support Centers"". As of 2015 Lowe's has 5. "
bad,Wages are decent but you have to pick up slack for a lot of other employees. If you love to break your back this job is perfect. There was always something to do (depending on which department you are in).
bad,"A typical day at work consist of zoning and facing assigned department section, and engaging customers.  I have learned to operate power equipments to move merchandise from top stock and pipe cutter and threading machine.  The management is too strung out with their responsiblities to care about the advancement of subordinates. I work with a handful of veterans so there is some comraderie. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with a multitude of customers who are inconsiderate and have a sense of entitlement.  The most enjoyable part of the is finding and learning about new products for personal use."
bad,"Typical day: clock in, wait on customers, clean and restock your common area, refunds, fill internet orders, do credit card applications, answer phones, re-rout phone calls, submit forms and products on defective items, deal with difficult situations and customers, resolve issues, order and set up deliveries, clock out."
bad,Their is not enough help int he store and they want you to work late and not pay you over time.
bad,I honestly don't like management ways they change to much and do not care about their employees
bad,"It's a job, i thought was a good company but the really don't know how to take care of their employees."
bad,"never appreciated for what you have done, i learned nothing... i was thrown under the buss as soon as i started. management sucked. hardest part of the job was being expected to do everything while being understaffed. there was nothing enjoyable about the job."
bad,"Lowe's is very behind the times in their Computer systems, making the load on employees very difficult. The store manager at the Big Rapids store is very demeaning to employees and regularly threatens or scolds  them in front of customers. Employees who have been there for awhile and have earned larger salaries are systematically fired so lower cost replacements can be hired. Very poor manager of people, needs some sensitivity training."
bad,"To sum it up: Being on time, not missing a day of work, always going above and beyond is the Quickest way Not to be promoted at Lowes."
bad,Some of my coworker complain every day about management .New worker can come to the company and get a position before present worker that been working there for years
bad,Was not the best place in the world to work at. It was my first retail job and I couldn't stand it.
bad,Increased responsibility as an Area HR Manager. Provided guidance and training to management.
bad,"Used to be a good company. New CEO has slashed wages, hours and almost completely gotten rid of commissions, bonuses, discounts, retirement plans or any other incentive to motivate poorly paid store employees. Lowe's has lost a lot of good people over the last few years."
bad,"Management poor in that it was a adversarial type of management system.  Commissions, bonuses, anything of that sort were slowly taken away during the time worked there. Hours and scheduling terrible, many times with working until 11 PM followed by opening at 6 AM. Open too many Holidays.  Too few workers on the sales floor led to problems with customers - largely with reason."
bad,High pressure environment. Learned people and management skills. Conflict resolution. Co-workers were the best part of the job!!!
bad,My fellow co-workers were very nice.  The store I was at was making a lot of hour cuts. Not an ideal job when they had people working there for 20 years without a managerial opportunity.
bad,Its got lots opportunities for growth but management pool is weak academically.
bad,"huge facility lots of team members, equipment operation is the main backbone of the facility."
bad,Most stores in this industry have a certain culture that makes it somewhat cliquish... If you're not part of the gossip you're an outcast.
bad,"Very miserable place to work. I don't know about the other lowes but the one in Vacaville was terrible. some of the managers suck and the ""Head Cashiers"" think they can treat you like a child and get away with it. the pay was alright but not enough for how they treat you. I was only there for a while and the time I was there 8 people quit."
bad,Lowes is not an Ideal work place. It feels like those in management care nothing for their employees and only care about money.
bad,A typical day at work begins at 5 am and usually ends somewhere around 10 pm leaving little to no time with family.
bad,Lowe's expectations of their employee's is not spelled out in their new hire policy.  Each store is run with a different manager and their own particular style.  I feel that corporate personnel have no concept what it is like to work at the store level.
bad,"This is a hard and unfulfilling company to work for, with limited room for advancement. "
bad,A typical day at work consists of cashing out customers.....helping customers with whatever questions that they may have about the products and services.....I have learned many things from there far as home improvement and also gardening.....I love my co-workers....they are really fun to be around....the hardest part of my job would be having to deal with the high demand of certain materials that may be out of stock or are not carried by the company.
bad,"very low employee moral to many store manager changes(6 in the 7 yrs I have been there all have been fired or quit)give tasks without explaining how or what needs done. all but tells employees they are worthless and everything is their fault,no support from asst mgrs. never answers phones when you call and never give straight answers and all have different answers to your questions just to name a few."
bad,This is a good company to work for if you are looking for short term employment. Just be aware the shifts vary greatly and it is difficult to work around other schedules.
bad,no job security low pay no advancement low hrs don't hire full time
bad,"a typical day at work was running credit applications, using the register and checking on online orders. I learned how to quickly use their systems and get our customers though the check outs as fast as possible, my management did not want to advance any cashier from the front line to the store itself. my co workers were very friendly and always helped out in the front of the store if needed. the hardest part of my job was the slow days when you had to stand in one place for hours with nothing to do. the most enjoyable part was learning all the home repair and do it yourself stuff."
bad,"Most ASM's and Store Mgrs are all running the stores in street wise manner as such , the Management style sucks !"
bad,"When I first Started with Lowe's it seemed like a great company to work for however, they have made so many changes that it has been hard to keep up. They also preach one thing and do another. It makes it very hard to follow upper management. The hours are also long for what they pay."
bad,he aprendido basicamente a manejar las relaciones interpersonales y a tener una posicion negociadora y trato amigable con los clientes. La parte mas dificil es el incumplimiento de plazos de entrega acordados y no respetados por parte de la empresa. Lo que mas me gusto es la relacion con los clientes y la cantidad de personas que he conocido
bad,"Typical Day At Lowes In Plymouth Meeting, PA... Consist Of Mass Amounts Of Customers, With No Staff. I Learned To Keep My Composure When It Comes To Customer Service. The Management Is Ok But Could Be Way Better In My Eyes. My Co-workers (under management) Are Amazing. The Hardest Part About Lowes Is Doing Someone Elses Job While Trying To Do Your Own (due to understaff issue). Most Enjoyable Part Of My Job, Is Going Home."
bad,"Could never fully perform job because we usually weren't properly staffed, everyone always seemed to be in a bad mood, could never ask for help or you would get bad reaction from other employees, management would not listen, EVER, you could be talking to them one-on-one but they did not listen."
bad,Order Management...selling appliances and working with an occasional cabinet or countertop inquiry.
bad,"If you expect to work in an environment where your manager treats you as an equal, or a valued member of their team, 9 times out of 10 this sadly will never happen. You are held accountable for even the most trivial rule infractions, and there is no ""verbal warning,"" I promise. You WILL be written up the second you violate any rule, no matter how tiny, and regardless of how senseless the rule may be. I was written up for talking to a customer too long."
bad,"To many employees doing everything possible to avoid work & customers. Some, not all, asm's do as little as possible and find a reason to leave early on their closing nights-but expect inventory to magically appear on the shelves. Go figure??"
bad,"Worked for them for years,at several stores,they treat you like garbage,and do not value your input. Just leave your Good ideas and Brain at home,and you will go far with the company."
bad,"Loved my job at 1st. Once I was promoted to manager, all the stress slowly started. I think when they ""Never stopped Improving"" was the start of the downfall of morale for employees. I have noticed a decline of talent maintained as well as our talent wasn't rewarded or promoted for the hard work the did day in and out."
bad,"I was hired as a weekend associate and within 6 months, I applied for a department manager position. I obtained the position because of my previous experience as store manager. Average Joe's don't move up very easily in this company. Even my starting pay as a weekend associate was higher than most full time associates. There is a lot of cronyism mentality and hard work is recognized but not rewarded. I feel that if I didn't have 9 years experience as a sales rep and manager, they wouldn't have looked at me once for any higher position. Morale is low with Lowe's, but what's even worse is their complete disregard for work/life balance. Assistant managers get the shaft. Schedules where you close one day and come back to open the next is common practice with Lowe's. Store manager has banker's hours....enough said."
bad,"very stressful , a lot can be done to improve the company from the very top to bottom"
bad,"Cashiered. Learned how to work their registers, return, special sales, operate and answer their multi-line phones, and closing duties. The management seemed to always be in bad moods, not happy with their jobs, and not willing to help customers. Co-workers were a little helpful and more pleasant to be around. Hardest part of the job was seeing the management in bad moods everyday. I was pregnant with my daughter and felt I was treated differently. Also, I had other co-workers that had worked their longer than me that told me that they always treated pregnant women that way. It wasn't a very enjoyable job."
bad,A great place to work with friendly non-management employees. Learned many skills while working there but management was not very helpful. Mostly did management type tasks for the managers who did nothing but delegate their own work. Most managers could not even complete simple tasks on the computer system and relied heavily on regular employees to complete their work. Always did more work than my job description implied but learned many skills because of it.
bad,Very demanding huge responsibility. There is no training and hardly no support!! Expectation to succeed are near impossible. The vision is great but new store management needs to learn ALLOT about the people and the right way to motivate. Change in leadership from the top down is exactly that top down! No collaboration!
bad,"A typical day at work to me is not the hours of work you work in a day,it is the quality of work you put in the hours you work.I learned to be more of a hard,and dependable worker.Ive learned a great deal while working at lowes how to install certain appliances. I work well with fellow empoyee's always willing to help when I can.The hardest part of the job is working in the heat.The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.Lowes was and good place to work."
bad,"I loved my job, loved the people i worked with. Years ago there was room for advancement, not anymore. Too many changes, great people have lost there jobs for what? LEF, really? No consistency with policies, favoritism, HR's are horrible. Great place to work if you want to be apart of the Good Ol boys club, women need not apply!"
bad,The pay is solid if all you want is a job but the company has lost their way with all the changes in senior management.
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. Create's it's own problems by allowing the customer to dictate operating procedures. Communications are hindered because everyone is covering their backside. Training programs hyped, but are difficult to access."
bad,Sales Edge has poor management from the owner downward..unskilled people in management positions ..overcharges Lowes for the actual work that is being performed ..office management rude ...Sales Edge has no compassion for its employees...provides no overtime pay and no provision for health insurance..only has workers comp required by law...and should have car allowance for using our own vehicles for work and maintaining 14 stores in our assigned territories
bad,"After being employed for just about four years, management closed down my lowe's with zero notice."
bad,"Lowe's is not the best place to work if you have ambitions of moving up in the compnay you work for. Once you have worked up to Assistant Store Manager, you hit a glass ceiling, and if you try to break that obstacle, they get rid of you and hire someone that they can pay less money for what they paid you to do."
bad,"this is a company that will romance you with benefits and a ""culture of caring"" that doesnt exist. They promise you a career, advancements and training, but when you request these things you are ignored. I requested to be moved form the fron end as a cashier to almost every department in the store... in a couple of departments the manager them self has even requested i be moved to that area...only to fall on deaf ears for over two years. Great place to work if you are lazy and have no plans for your future. Also dont try to go to school to better yourself...I know of a girl who was let go because her school schedule and work schedule were to close to each other in the day."
bad,I spent 3 years at the call center and felt that my growth was stagnated because I didn‚Äôt fit in the click. I joined the million dollar in sales my first full year but still was overlooked for advancement even though I had over 20 years of management experience. The calls were repetitive negative and mostly combative because the customers were not satisfied with their products. I also felt that since I was Jewish I was treated differently and looked down upon because I didn‚Äôt participate in Christian holiday activities that was planned by management when we were supposed to be reviewing company goals and procedures. I no longer do business with this company because of an anti-Semetic statement that was made to me by one of the store management members during a return. When a complaint was filed they never followed up with me as promised. Overall this was a terrible experience for me and I feel that caution should be used when applying for work with this company.
bad,"I joined Lowe's thinking it would be a good company to join. Soon I realized I made a mistake. If you're a good worker you'll get overworked and under paid. Poor management, they will tell you what you want to hear to get the job done. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Nothing is ever done right. Felons beware! They will hire you and wait for your three months and all the sudden lay you off. They say safety is a priority but make you do sketchy things or use broken equipment to get the job done."
bad,Said before the people your are working with are taking you for granted and this is particularly on the position i used to working with. As people leave because of the person not because of company.
bad,Most of my life I've spent in restaurants working for best chefs in the world. With that in mind you get burnt out so i applied to lowes. Worked outside garden co workers were extremely fun and enjoying talking with them however management was something else just lazy no work ethic. Your in 110 degree weather you have to pay for water.
bad,Very toxic atmosphere focused on performance rather than employee needs. Highly competitive environment with poor management and productivity. Very little respect for employees.
bad,Since we switch over to the new system lowes is a horrible place to work for. No free time at all the way they do the schedule. Our bosses change all the time.
bad,"Good people delt a bad hand.  Individually the associates are great but the entire store lacks decent management.  A couple of assistant store managers are trying to get things going but no one has your back, so nothing gets fixed.  Be aware of a vague job description"
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for 3 years. I'm a hard worker, but I got burnt out. I worked as a Non-CDL Delivery driver for 2 years, before that I worked as a simple customer service associate. I was the go to guy for everyone that needed to know how to do something or needed a difficult customer taken care of, but man did I butt heads with management. Once they catch wind you are a good worker, you become their puppet. I butted heads with multiple managers since they thought they knew what our job entailed and would overload my truck or fill my plate full on top of what I was already doing. If you're on the road, you can't go home till EVERYTHING is done. I don't know how many times I had to pull 12-15 hour days because I was overbooked and had to drive hours out of town or they would call me on the road to go back and pick up more product because a customer HAD to have it. Management doesn't care about you. Plus, they hire incompetent managers that lie on their resume then ask associates to fix their mistakes. Corporate constantly changes the attendance policy so good luck understanding how sick days and PTO works! Job security is a huge issue especially for this position since a lot of other regions are third party delivery so the job could be on the chopping block soon. You might not even get a heads up before they fire you! (Assemblers and FSAs were let go on the spot) Corporate doesn't understand they are shooting themselves in the foot going third party, but all they care about is money. "
bad,"Management will play favorites.  Do not consider the ramifications of their actions fully, only the immediate need.  Associates guidance is confusing based on direction from senior management team to them.  No consistent message and/or direction.  Frustration in hourly staff based on scheduling that does not provide a base rotation to follow and plan a good work-life balance.  While there is a daily routine to follow with regards to daily requirements, the rest of the day is spent cleaning up after customers during focus selling times.  Staffing in departments are challenging where one or two associates cover over 14 aisles of products.  Management acts like task masters to associates who can't complete tasks assigned regardless of circumstances."
bad,Company once valued their associates as their greatest asset.  Now the company is run mainly with shareholders in mind at associates expense.  Work standards have also dropped dramatically as a direct result of newly misplaced values.
bad,If you want a job you can call off and nothing happens to you.  This is the job for you.  Some of the mangament team was nice the others walk around with a mean look on there face and not friendly at all.  If your customers don't do there surverys....it is your fault and you could loose your job.  Could be a nice place to work but not the one in Lorain.
bad,I would not recommend working there.  Pay and benefits are borderline insulting.  Workplace culture is laughable.  No one is held accountable.  Little or no hope of advancement until you are there for several years.
bad,management has no trust in employees. will go back on words and break policies to not loss a customer. have no sense of DOT regulations for drivers. lack even the smallest amount of communication. deduction of meal breaks is deducted wether it is taken oft not. most requested days off ate negated with no explanation.
bad,Management was not good. The store manager was the worst. The pay was not bad but the amount of work they wanted was higher in this retail then most for the pay.
bad,"Working as an Merchandising Service Associate is hard work. You have to move steel beams and steel decking. Must be able to read a planogram to set the bay to that picture, and help customers. Also you have to deal with the hour by hour changes of don't do this, do this, stop what your doing and do this and why are you not done yet."
bad,Try calling for a manager anytime in the day.  You will get passed around for a while because they don't want to deal with you.  Good luck trying to find help in the aisles.  Deeply cut staffing to appease stock holders leads to no employees on the floor.
bad,"lack of dependability when it came to the managers. managers showed a lot of favoritism towards employees that they were friends with, and did not know how to separate friend from employee."
bad,"Hours worked with my personal life, but was tiring and started to feel wear on body for the excessive walking and standing. Customers became positive and was at times enjoyable to see and assist with lifting and helping them with products.  I took pride in cleaning and organizing my area daily."
bad,"I was a MST and the management was horrible, was unfair, the manager picked favorites, wouldn't do their job correctly and lastly we went through 3 managers withing 7 months"
bad,"It does not take long to realize you will never be rewarded for hard work, so employees quickly stop trying. Management is hired from outside sources more times than not. Overall, not bad if you're just looking for a job, would not seek a career with Lowe's."
bad,Cannot count on the people around you to do their jobs. Consistently set up to fail. The job I held was reliant upon others completing tasks the day before... which were usually incomplete leaving me to do others jobs.
bad,boring and slow place to work.  Management takes advantage of people who work hard and don't punish those who are lazy.  If your a lazy worker you'll fit right in in their environement
bad,"I have worked at two separate Lowe's locations, and both of them had sever communication issues between management and the hourly associates. This was made clearer the higher up in the store I went. I would often hear conflicting directions from my direct manager and the store manager. As a guy who just wanted to come in and work hard, this was extremely frustrating. Trying to ""transfer"" stores is even more maddening. I had tried to apply to another location for over 2 months before finally giving up and cutting ties with Lowe's."
bad,Lowe's at first will seem to be a great place to work. But the management team has no ethics at all. This is what Lowe's culture has become and unless you are one of the upper management's flunkies you have a target on your back. Your work ethics at Lowe's does not matter unless you are part of the group.
bad,"It use to be a good place to work but after being at a few different stores you realize the only way you get anywhere is if your liked personally or are a brown nose Your hard work doesn't make you stand out, they will just use it to there advantage. Good luck getting help from most managers they hind in the back and gossip most the day"
bad,"Lowe's hires a lot of people and places them where they request, knowing many will not continue on. There was little in the way of management interaction except for a morning pep talk that was not reflective of the actual employee experience. It would not take much to invest more in keeping employees. Maybe pay a bit more to start."
bad,"As a Female Assistant Manager was very hard. Regardless Of the talent you bring.  Have to work twice as hard to be acknowledged. If your strong and can stand up you will win over the associates, however you will never go forward in your career. Senior Management made it clear ONLY because I was a woman,  I would not get my own store. I was only woman manager in entire southern  Alberta"
bad,"The store I was at supports managers who only care about protecting their own agenda. The managers I felt with lied, blamed and falsified records to protect only themselves to cover their own poor performance and lack of integrity.  They don't provide proper training or treatment of employees fairly. They play favorites and have no integrity whatsoever."
bad,"It was a great pace to work except for the lazy management, very bad pay, and they kept me as seasonal the whole time I was there so no security either."
bad,Advancement in the corporation is easier if you work behind the scenes! Yard workers don't advance unless there is a retirement or transfer! Good luck
bad,"Loved working there at first, until I was able to see the lack of respect of management towards employees. They are clickish, all take lunch together as long as they want, there is no real ‚Äúopen door policy‚Äù. If you have an issue with management, they tell each other & retaliate towards you. A very hostile environment to work in. DON‚ÄôT DO IT UNLESS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!"
bad,Worked there for 2 years. Management was horrible. 4 managers in 2 years. The one with mental issues was demoted and kept. Old boy network total disregard for employee. Constant berating by supervisors terrible training. I was reduced to tears on several occasions. Sexist environment. 60 hour plus weeks expected. Employees were always sueing company for long hours. Run run run!!!!
bad,"Bad culture, management doesn't listen to what the employees have to say.  Must be cross trained for different departments whether you like it or not. Pay is not that good."
bad,"Not a good job unless you have a burning desire to move into management.  Even then, you‚Äôll sell your soul to the company to move up, they own you!  Given that, they go through managers like toilet paper.  If you stub your toe once, you‚Äôre out!  "
bad,Things are constantly changing in bad ways. Management is dishonest about what is expected and unwilling to work with you for work/life balance. Very difficult to deal with the constantly changing rules and schedule.
bad,Myself I work there for 5 + years I was in maintenance. I was let go for reasons of wrongfully using FMLA which a judge found them guilty of unlawful termination they let me go a week week and a half before my baby is born which we had complications and they knew there was complications and yet they let me go.
bad,"where sometimes employees work 9 days in a row.  There are no weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly reviews of any employee.  Hard work is not rewarded, lazy employees are not reprimanded, the only way to advance in this company is to switch job titles.  Interviews for new positions are done by in-store managers who usually have no training in leadership or management because Lowe's has done away with in-store HR employees all together."
bad,"As the title says it's retail"
bad,The only positive thins I can say is that I worked with a good group of people. Every day was a surprise to and see if we had coverage on the floor. Continually moved to fill in due to  lack of associates but still required to meet our goals.
bad,Worked here part time for a few months. Got the hang of their outdated systems. I got trained outside so they decided to leave me outside garden. Sometimes I wouldn't get a break and it would be so hot in the 100s. The thing that sucked the most was at the end of the day if you're closing you have to clean the restrooms. Like why? Lowes needs to hire janitorial services. Sometimes the mens restroom would be so clogged it was disgusting!  Pay was okay I guess. Work environment was okay too.
bad,"Always unhappy with management, employees would always make fun of others, if you were not with the ""in crowd"", nobody would talk to you. Management would try to talk to you normal but ended up making you feel more worse about any situation."
bad,"Overall it is a job, none the less I find it filled with people that want to run the store to their own standard. If you follow the rules according to one manager, you'll get in trouble with the whole store of managers because you did not follow what the others wanted."
bad,"Good pay, paid time off, and benefits, but the job is labor intensive, the management is strict, judgmental, and unforgiving, Jobs so repetitive and boring. People are competitive and drama ridden. The turn over is really high due to above reasons. This place literally eats your Soul."
bad,"Employee morale is at the lowest I've ever seen right now. Store manager is great, If everyone would communicate, it would help tremendously. Things need to be done differently."
bad,"The store manager is a joke. There is favoritism. When you apply with open availability it has to stay that way, they don't care if something in your life changes."
bad,"Greedy company concerned only with profits. Managers are pushed and driven to cut labor at expense of customer service. You‚Äôre a number, not a person and when they‚Äôre thru with you they cast you aside till they need you again. Not managements fault- corporate to blame, which explains so many store closures"
bad,"Management really sucks. The CEO is running this company into the ground just like he did with K-Mart. All management cares about are numbers, not the employees."
bad,"stressful job, low pay and icing on cake bad management.  Lowes is on par with Walmart concerning pay and work environment.  Not much more can be said.  Lowes leads the way towards the race to bottom."
bad,Stores are short staffed and it is difficult to accomplish what you must accomplish in a day. Mid management is over-pressured by store manager so they are occupied with that and so are not responsive to employee questions or problems relating to store projects or tasks at hand. As an employee you are pretty much on your own.
bad,Lowes is ok if you are in need of a job.  The constant restructuring messed everything up. Didn't feel like employees really mattered and that they were easily replaced.
bad,"If you‚Äôre a fan of retail, like working weekends, like working 6 days in a row at least once a month, like not being able to get home until 11:30 maybe even Midnight some nights when closing than Lowe‚Äôs is definitely for you. Otherwise, keep looking. You will have a hard time balancing your life while working with Lowe‚Äôs. Positions are endlessly changing, being taken away, and then years later, resurfacing again with new titles but the same responsibilities."
bad,"I cannot recommend working for Lowe's as a F.S.A. (Facility service associate). For what's expected of you the $12.75 an hour is an insult. From cleaning bathrooms (EXTENSIVE cleaning) to wiring floor sanders and everything in between, you have to be extremely mechanically inclined. This should easily be a $25.00 per hour job."
bad,"Quality of the company went from great to horrible in the last 18 months. Rampant harrassment and NOTHING"
bad,"Lowe's is not a great place to work, at least not store 387. My ASM was very disrespectful, to the point where he didn't even say good morning. I opened that store five days a week, eight hours a day for two years but couldn't get full time benefits. Pay is good, working conditions are terrible."
bad,They used to be a great company! Family oriented. Management looked out for their people. Now there's a new CEO and things have gone downhill fast. It's sad to go to work and not know if you have a job anymore.
bad,If they appreciated their employees just a little bit this company wouldn't be in the shape it's in which is 2nd place. Management sits in their offices in front of their computers. They have no clue what's going on out on the floor nor do they care. It's really sad because all it takes to get the best out of your workers is good old appreciation.
bad,If you aren't from JC Penney. Staples or Target your chance of landing an IT job here are slim. There are big/good ideas but they are not being implemented by the people that know why things are the way they are
bad,Store level has pretty consistent guide but district level and up up seem to be poor leaders that care little about their teams and manage by intimidation and threats. Not a very stable work environment
bad,I was laid off after four years with no notice but I enjoyed the people I worked with. Overall its a great place to work at but don't expect to have job security with this company.
bad,Seasonal cashier . their alot of favoritism self checkout goes down every 10 minutes. Sometimes your left alone you have the machines ringing in your ear . It felt as if you where working in a 3rd world country. Takes the head cashier hours sometimes to bring you money. They except you to keep calling and calling for overrides . also i was always told to take 30 mins while the rest took 1hr luches. Favoritism at its best.
bad,To me just not somewhere  I would think I would stay for a career its very stressful when i sit and try to help a customer and try to give the best customer service i can offer and i get chewed out about it
bad,If you want to work like a mule in the field please apply. The plants care are not priority but cleanliness is. There needs to be more teamwork in place
bad,Fast pace once season started. Not much time to relax as customers were in need of help. Friendly coworkers and some managers. Overall it was a good place for a part-time job.
bad,"Everyone tells me I came into Lowe's at a ""bad time"" because there are so many transitions taking place. I have seen so many people lose their job in the last 3 months that I have worked here due to phasing the position out and going 3PL. I have been working at Lowe's for only 4 months."
bad,Lowe‚Äôs was a starter job for me I lasted there around 6 months to a year. While working at Lowes I was always a yes man and you had to be if you wanted the managers to give you an inch you‚Äôd have to go a mile for them hence why you see why I was 3 different positions. Anyway so everyday I would be verbally harassed by our ASM and other Managers about my school schedule and Corporate didn‚Äôt care After filing multiple complaints. Then over the summer Lowe‚Äôs decide to cut my hours out of nowhere after changing my schedule to open availability they claimed it was because we didn‚Äôt have enough business but for some reason it sounded like they were trying to force me out because they didn‚Äôt wanna have to have a school kid anymore
bad,"They put you thru about 40 hrs of paid ""training"", more abt company line than actual training. Lots of BS abt how you can really rise up the company ladder.  At first you're given lots of hours, sometimes more than you asked for. But beware, before long those hours are gone. You go from 5 days to 1 in a flash. They love to give you a line abt only allowing so many per department.  Most of the managers are unfriendly and half of them don't know what they're doing."
bad,the managements incompetent. often they ignore company policies to a degree that makes every other associate shake their head atleast I was paid yakno
bad,"I was the Project Specialist of Interiors for Lowes from 2016 to 2019 designing, and selling kitchen and bathroom remodels. I have over 20 years experience as a sales executive for several high end companies. When I began working for Lowes in Midwest, Oklahoma it was a struggle because their operations model had a complete lack of sales knowledge, but in the first year I raised their sales from about $250,000.00 to over $700,000.00. The market manager began to consult me for a new sales force. In October 2019, I was offered the same position in Jacksonville, Florida at an increase of pay in a much larger market. I move to Jacksonville, Florida at great expense to myself during the holiday season. After working only about 5 weeks, and closing three major jobs, I was told that the program was being cancelled. This was the decision of the new CEO Marvin Ellison. He made no attempt to phase out the program or put a freeze on hiring. Lowes and Mr. Ellison left me jobless and stranded in Florida. I had to get out of all of my leases and the small severance package was barely enough to get me back to my home state of Texas...penniless."
bad,"Corporate makes changes with no notice - meaning employment is not guaranteed from one day to the next.  Employees told their position is eliminated in the middle of the shift."
bad,"Pay is good. Training is very brief and then you‚Äôre on your own. It is not worth the stress. Worked mostly early am and closing shifts. Only one weekend a month off. Worked all holidays except Christmas and Thanksgiving.  ‚ÄúSpecial ‚Äú workers got the good shifts and were showed partiality. A lot of favoritism. Store manager would not even greet you when she entered the store if you said hello. You can work your butt off and not even get a compliment for all your efforts. "
bad,"Trading substandard, overhire to keep associate hours as low as possible. The good ole boy mentality is overwhelming, not so much to the public, but clearer to new employees"
bad,"I honestly hated it there. There were some good people I worked with that I got along great with but the management is poor. They couldn't get my schedule fixed, they scheduled me more than I signed up for, expected me to do everyone else's job because I was the only one willing to actually work. Wouldn't approve my request for a department change and instead put other people there. More than once was I yelled at for just doing my job."
bad,I feel I cannot give you a review. I was told if I didn't have anything good to say don't say it at all. I did have some good years but things have changed.
bad,"Very fast pase most of the time, which I like. Employees complain about management all day. It gets very tiresome quick. Most of the time I just felt like I was only a number to them and I personally did not matter at all. It's all about the money and nothing else. If you try to have fun while working at the same time you are looked at like a slacker. Meanwhile, the real slackers get away with everything. Not an enjoyable place to be. If you have to be there every day it should at least be pleasant."
bad,"I was fired after seven years because I voiced an opinion. Lowes says they have an open door policy, they do until you need it. Then its non existent. Management is a joke, no accountability on their part but a lot of passing the buck. Hours seem never ending. Scheduling does not work, to lenient on people missing shifts. I would never work there again."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was my regular customers,management  team was very  lax and were very slow to respond to any problems and rarely answered their phones"
bad,"Hours were inconsistent, expectations for assigned position were not clear and frequently changed, training is subpar, individual managers are either great or terrible, some coworkers are nice average people some lack understanding of what is appropriate for work, pay sucks unless you're management"
bad,"There was discrepancy about how much I was told I would be paid hourly, I felt I was mislead. Overall I liked the people I worked with, management was dishonest."
bad,"Liked the job , management sucked (very clickish). The manager would never leave her office unless there were visitors the day before . I worked 33yrs in the grocery business from a bagger to asst mgr and before our shift we walked the store EVERY DAY . Showed she didn't care about the store or the people ."
bad,Management has direct correlation to moral. Maybe a different store or different manager could have made for a better experience. If they placed value on employees who worked more than sucked up it could be good.
bad,"-"
bad,"Worked here for 16 years, they eliminated my job, I was told I could apply for others jobs at Lowe‚Äôs (at a 30% pay cut,) was told I had to apply for and accept another job within one year or I‚Äôd be fired, was denied five jobs I applied for in that year, and they fired me!"
bad,new CEO took away many positions creating a heavier work load on employees. CEO also took away HR and now associates are responsible for their own paperwork. the job isn't difficult if you are properly trained. other senior associates are unwilling to teach.
bad,"Stressful job, no set schedule, and they are eliminating most full time positions. Management is focused on short term profits."
bad,"Most of my coworkers and managers were great people, I unfortunately had a boss that had been with the company for 20 years but had only recently advanced to an assistant store manager position, 2 steps up from a regular customer service associate they hire off the street."
bad,"The business is  ran from the home office. They show up in the store when sales numbers have fallen looking for reasons and solutions."
bad,"No comment, my experience here was not the best. I work and do my job coverage of other Departments other than my asinged is often the day must be able to multitask"
bad,"A typical day at work involved putting away freight, stocking shelves, assisting customers, copying keys, re-keying locksets."
bad,"Biggest issue was the scheduling, the management was bad at it and  all scheduling was done three weeks in advance. This made it very difficult to work around."
bad,Poor job security . Unprofessional  place to work. I would not recommend  this company to anyone. Very bad work experience. Customer satisfaction is st the bottom of the chain.
bad,"Workload is not overbearing, I get along well with coworkers... but lacking in sense of teamwork. Used to look forward to day of work now I dread it.."
bad,"A good place for unskilled labor to advance but not professional and definately NOT for horticulture people."
bad,Schedule was never consistent and would change at the last minute without any notification. Departments were never staffed well and no overtime was allowed. No effort by managers were made when they were needed. Constantly getting in trouble for not covering your department when you are the only one scheduled for the day. No help was given in those situations either.
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for 10 years. They say they promote within but it's here and far between. They want you to do the work of the department manager without the pay while the department manager is in the installs office, managers office, HR office, or basically anywhere except where they are supposed  to be talking and socializing instead of on the sales floor while your customer assistance button is ringing off the hook. That was my experience. Favoritism and micro managing."
bad,"Low pay with horrible raises, managers that only walk around and don't acknowledge you unless there's a problem in your department and lack of staffing is what prevents me from recommending this place to others"
bad,"Extreme amount of very heavy lifting.  Manager would never schedule appropriate amount of staff to handle work load.  Co-workers were awesome and others in the store were excellent to work with as well. I personally really enjoyed Lowe's, wish I could have gotten a little less physically demanding job there."
bad,"When I first began working for Lowe's distribution over three years ago, it was pretty good: management was on the ball, gear and tools were in decent shape, and overall morale was good. However, after our store manager was assigned a new position in another state (a position he didn't want), a slow tide of dysfunction began to take hold. Small things at first, tools began to wear down and went without replacements. Managers were feeling pressure from corporate. Over time, a sense of apathy settled over the store, and managers were either apathetic entirely, or wrote up/fired employees for the smallest offenses. Broken delivery trucks would be ordered back onto the roads. On several occasions, easily preventable damages occurred due to clamp trucks not being serviced or repaired. "
bad,"Management was poor, they lie and say they will work around school schedules when they hire you. Then they schedule you during class and tell you to show up or lose your job.  HR is a joke anything you tell him the whole store knows in less than a week.  Training is also a  joke, and surprise! When you can't do your job (because no one will teach you how) you start getting in trouble.  This store will set you up to fail"
bad,Lowes‚Äôs has gone downhill few years after I started working for them. Lowe‚Äôs does not value their employees! People use to be excited to work for Lowe‚Äôs and stayed.... now they do not hire good quality people and their turnover rate it increasing !
bad,"It seems Lowe‚Äôs was more interested in getting credit applications and surveys than increasing sales.   Contractors are in a hurry and managers want you to beg them for a survey.  Lowe‚Äôs had many good employees but it only takes one bad manager to ruin your day.  "
bad,"Employees that work hard get over worked."
bad,"Managers don't care about the person  you are just a body. Don't care if you have 10 plus years or 1 month. Will let people go in a heart beat. Managers will throw you under a bus with the blink of an eye. Seen it happen to me as well as associates with 20 or 25 years in and with associates with a month. I believe the more time you have in and you start to make the kind of money a manager makes, you become a target."
bad,Nothing good to say.. heard some stores were better managed. They need to close the one I worked at. Customers were also to blame. So much theft went on.
bad,"I worked the morning Unload/Stocking crew. The people were decent, but the work itself was pretty physically demanding, especially with my wear-and-tear from my previous job."
bad,"I've been there 2 years and have yet to get a raise. I make minimum wage while the new people they hire come in making more than me. I bust my butt every day for nothing,  The people that do absolutely nothing make as much or more than me and management does nothing about it. "
bad,"If you don't mind making this company your life, it's a great fit. The new CEO seems to think our life outside of Lowe's doesn't matter. Do not recommend."
bad,"I would not recommend buying into the corporate ""you can be a store manager if you stick with it"" type stuff that will get jammed down your throat.  raises are few and far between and good luck with a full time positon"
bad,I spent more time as a greeter than doing what I was hired for Truck driver. I worked almost every weekend and got no benifit for doing weekends. I like my weekends to spend with family
bad,"No store manager I met had a background in management, or college degree in the subject.  Micromanage  intimidate staff. The place is a disaster area ."
bad,"If your not friends with management you will go nowhere, management was very sneaky, any problem management would cover it up or push you to a breaking point where you would leave or they could let you go, procedures were not followed"
bad,ended up in a fight between the two specialists arguing like an old couple for no reason and HR was always looking to fire people. Management refused to work with employees. Schedule was nonsense. you would not know your hours until the week before and would get stuck with closing-opening shifts immediately following each other
bad,Hard place to work to be honest. Hours were long. Store Manager would constantly disrespect employees work ethic while not producing any kind of work himself.
bad,"New CEO among with every single new face on the top-tier of the company- show enthusiasm and seem to be interested in turning the company around. However scrolling through the feedback in this website along with other employment related websites, presents a completely different picture. If you compare it to 4-6 years ago- overall morale of a store level employee has dropped drastically.  Pulling HR away from stores is a huge mistake on so many levels. Many of the previous comments are making fair points and are spot on. Being a fairly long time employee- I can honestly say, that at some point too much stress- becomes too much. Main stress factor to someone who really cares about their job is the time given to train and re-train new and existing employees, which is literally a 0. The amount of time allocated to many (most in recent months) tasks is absolutely laughable and almost feels that someone is mocking their fellow employees. Everything is being calculated, from break time to how long you helped a customer to how long it takes you to complete a task - without taking it into a consideration that someone off the street does not have the knowledge nor experience to satisfy those expectations. At a current state- an overwhelming amount of changes have been released to the stores all at once. For example- on a day to day basis- majority of IT related issues, take forever to actually ""work"" and absolutely nobody within the market has answers to specific software/ task related issues, everybody blames their brother when things go sideways and it's time to hold someone accountable."
bad,"have to set up to unload your truck, never having proper amount of people to do job. expectations are set way to high. management is none existant. Best part of job is the people"
bad,"Lack of good management, strict on hours. They will cut your hours and don‚Äôt care about how you going to make a living! They will choose an outside for a position before considering an employee that‚Äôs trying to advance in there work career!"
bad,"I can honestly that I enjoyed my coworkers and flexibility with my national guard schedule,  but that is where the good things ended for me. A job that pays roughly 10.50 an hour and expects you to operate a register system, operate powered equipment (including forklift) inventory, cycle count, cut glass and plexiglass, re-key locks (locksmith work) cut wood and chain, to make keys, provide customer service, downstock merchandise, load heavy merchandise,  ect. The work is simply not worth the pay and getting a raise is worse than pulling teeth."
bad,"Busy mornings to put away received product by a specific time"
bad,"No support, no training, expected to do way more than your job description. Forced into specialty areas with no backup. Minimal staffing at best. 5:1 manager to worker ratio. Common sense not applicable. Intrusive into personal time with threats of disciplenary action for non paid time. "
bad,Weak management with no focus.  No strategy.  No recognition.  No advancement opportunities.  Little/no training.  I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,The salary was great when commission was offered. When the company took away the commission then implemented more remedial branding responsibilities took away the desire to help customers love where they lived.  The commission gave you the desire to grow the companies bussiness.
bad,"Set up and met with customers to create and design interior projects for their home. Set meetings to measure and look at current home set ups with customers, contractors and myself. Made assessments of home and requirements of structural,electrical, plumbing etc. requirements to accomplish job. Worked with contractors to put labor and product quotes together. Chose products and created and approved of designs for customers within budgets for them for either long term livability or resale. Managed process from start to finish of job."
bad,"The head cashiers are not helpful, superiority complexes EVERYWHERE! It would be a fun job if they could adapt to modern systems and staff twice as many employees."
bad,"Average company with poor management.  Employees left company, and to cut costs hired only part time, or did not replace at all.  Due to not having enough associates on many shifts, associates must cover several departments by themselves, not condusive to good business. Many departments did not have adequate inventory to satisfy customers needs."
bad,Most of the personnel are friendly. As a delivery driver it was nice to get out and meet the customers at their homes. most need their appliances replaced and are very happy to have a brand new appliance delivered and installed.
bad,"The idea of Lowe‚Äôs and its mission is what I loved about my everyday. Helping customers, co workers, my specific team. Making the everyday experiences for everyone as positive as I could.  I really enjoyed what I did.  Unfortunately the Store manager and his direct assistant manager where very unkind, unprofessional, and unsupportive.  They do not give praise or see potential in people an nurture it, direct it, guide them when they fall off track or are not going in the right direction.  They instead looked to studying the mistakes as opportunity to get rid of people."
bad,"I gained lifelong friends working here; However, the lack of accountability for management was astonishing. Constant bullying, disrespect, and inappropriate remarks went completely unnoticed even when notifying area staff. If you stated an opinion that disagreed with management petty documentation would start to increase until you felt that you could lose your job at any moment."
bad,"Lowe's employment culture has two distinct sides: the employees with solid work ethics and the employees with little to no work ethics. The employees who try hard to not work are not held accountable and the hard working employees are expected to pick up the slack. The training is very poor, leaving employees to feel as if they are set up to fail. It makes for a frustrating work environment with low employee morale."
bad,"If you can think for your self, are self motivated, take the initiative and are creative look some where else to work. They prefer to have followers not leaders and offer very limited structured training. Worst part of the job is the sucking up to managers to get ahead, insurance (70/30 plan that doesn't cover anything)and rude customers. Only good part is that 50% of the employees are nice people and enjoy working with, the others...clueless to life in general."
bad,Not entirely awful but it‚Äôs a job. Pay is decent but they will under pay you for the work you do if you let them get away with it. Always willing to teach new people
bad,Lack of communication and poor management. Expectation were unrealistic and did not treat everyone equally. Mandatory overtime. Very physical job but were very understanding when my husband passed away.
bad,Horrible place to build your career and management is horrible. It took almost 2 years for me to get a raise and I am certified forklift. The place is very unsanitary and customers call for complaint nearly everyday.
bad,Just looking for a new job its a very easy and fun job hard place to work at and deal with management since you have about 7 bosses all telling u to do something different other then that it is a nice work place
bad,"It was ok if you were a part of the ""in"" crowd."
bad,Managers don‚Äôt care if you have church Sunday morning they will still put you on the schedule. Also they get upset if you scheduled off during a busy time.
bad,Hard to want to work someplace where you cant get ahead and the only people going anywhere in the company are brown nosed incompetents. No training program for employees and different set of rules depending on who you hang out with.
bad,"Easy job but not a lot of help from managers or higher ups  "
bad,"I honestly wouldn‚Äôt recommend working at the Lowe‚Äôs in Thibodaux to ANYONE. The managers were horrible 70% of the time with the exception of a few. One of the cashiers passed out outside when I was working there and people from the store was in the break room making sure she was ok because they had to carry her in the break room, and one of the department managers and the assistant store manager were being so rude. They walked in and literally said everyone need to get out of here. Neither one of them asked if she wasn‚Äôt ok, nor did they try to call an ambulance. They do not care about there employees. It‚Äôs not all of the managers but it‚Äôs most of them. They are literally horrible people. There were many days I had to run my department completely alone. Everyone knows that during the spring the outside lawn and garden area is the busiest. There was days they had only 1 person on the schedule. The store carries so much mess and drama it‚Äôs ridiculous. I don‚Äôt recommend it all. The pay was good but sometimes even the amount I was getting paid didn‚Äôt feel like enough with all I went through while working there."
bad,I loved my job until they changed the whole corporate structure. I did a great job and got along with everyone of my co-workers and really had fun doing so
bad,Lowe‚Äôs would be a better place to work if it wasn‚Äôt for the management they are horrible. They don‚Äôt ever have a consistent plan for employees and they‚Äôre never on the same page.
bad,"A typical day: Answering calls.  As an on the phone supervisor, I handle everything from agent questions to escalated customers."
bad,Lowe's more about getting rid of associates they don't like or don't fit the mold they want. Too many managers not performing and having to help cover other departments
bad,"Very hard to advance unless you are best friends with management. Must have open availability if full time. As part time, they add you to the schedule without talking to you."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here. I been trying to find a different job, Not a different position for the past couple months. Some people are okay the ones you work with."
bad,"My first 10 years there were great, when combined receiving and deliveries for one manager was very overwhelming. They also need to apply more training ."
bad,"This company is not a friendly place to work. "
bad,"The job was easy for me to jump into as far as pulling orders. Management and sellers will sell a customer an order and not physically  check it or pull it. So some times it's not there for delivery.  The receiving area of this store is one of the worst I've ever seen. And it's not because of the crew on 3rd shift. They also throw on emergency  orders even when management  said no more, they still do it."
bad,"Working at Lowe's was a eye opener. They use you and then toss you out. Everything is done for the head store management to make them look good so they receive a BIGGER check at the end."
bad,"Well I worked in the flooring department doing whatever was necessary. I enjoyed working, it being my first job I had no intentions of staying, but the people were nice and I enjoyed it."
bad,there is a lot if work that gets pushed off on the only willing to work. the pay is okay but the management has went down over the years.  customers are sweet in most cases
bad,Contractor kitchen & bath installations cause many problems pretty much on just about every project. The software is very poor and can add hours of work rectifying the issues in addition to the long hours already involved in remodel projects.
bad,"I have been a full time associate with the company for a while. Full time employees are not allowed to have an availability.  Weekends off are few and far between. Management is mostly distrustful, rude and show no empathy toward anyone. Booking time off and getting it approved is impossible. They find a reason not to let you have time off."
bad,"We would sometimes get as little as 10 hours a week (PT), the managers are there but aren't there at the same time, phone lines are literally always backed up, managers tell employees to say one thing to customers but when the managers come around the customers they act as if what we are told to say (policy) is made up to make them look superior."
bad,"Working as a team. My department associates/manager and I worked together to complete most corporate and building task."
bad,Inconsistent Management direction. No work life balance. Inconsistent accountability of staff. Closing shift one night and scheduled to open the next day.
bad,"Orders would come from above and it seemed as if corporate had no clue what the morale and culture was in any store."
bad,(Receiving/Stocking) Fast paced stressful job with very high work load and minimal incentive. Little to no feedback from management leaves most employees in the dark.
bad,"was supposed to be trained on both an item picker and forklift, still waiting for a day that they can. I've just given up on asking for the. i was hired as a peak hour worker, and expected to do a full time employee's job, on a peak hours schedule. majority of the time i am the only one getting deliveries ready."
bad,"You are a number at Lowe's, not a person. Turn over rates are high, management does not care about retention, and anyone could lose their job during one of the many restructures the company has had."
bad,"I am a retired Marine with a tight work ethic and clear understanding of leadership. When I started working here it only took a few days to see why they have a high turnover and poor work areas. The employees don't care because the management does not. Training was weak and the schedule was inconsistent. "
bad,Benefits were way to high for monthly cost for family or spouses over 50 percent was taken out every two weeks left hardly any money to live on. Benefits kept going up with no pay raise which is very little at the end of the year
bad,"Working at Lowe's could be either dreadful or very rewarding. If your store manager did not work, it would probably be a good day. Management at Lowe's they do not lead by example. I know managers there talk behind each others backs with employees about how bad each of them are. Most of them don't want to work at all and will send someone else to take care of customers when customers want to speak to management. The store I worked at had about six very dedicated and hard working employees. There was 120 employees there. Every one of the six hard workers were well known to everybody. Those people were the ones to hold the sale and store together. Management would never let those people advance on the excuse that they were too valuable on the sales floor. It was more like they didn't want them to take their do nothing jobs. The most enjoyable part of the Lowe's experience is helping customers get tasks completed themselves. With good advice from your own knowledge was very rewarding."
bad,"Work life balance is horrible. You work at least 10 hours a day, five plus a week as a salaried manager. Your shift rotates from 345 am to 11 pm. Depending on the day. May only get 8 hours off between shifts. Work a 4 week rotation. Giving you one weekend off a month. First two and a half weeks of rotation you will work 14 out of 16 days. The ladt week and a half you work 6 out of 12 days. Plan on leaving at 11pm before your day off, and after a day off working a morning shift coming in between 345 am to 8 am. This is not per store. This is a corporate set rotation. You will handle customer issues ranging from delivery damage, install issues, unworking appliamces, backorders, etc. Even though lowes is moving to centralized install offices and delivery. The store still gets the brunt of angey customers. Expect to be understaffed due to corporate control on how much each store gets budgeted on hours to use in a week. Makes it very difficult in low volume stores take care of freight, help customers, and other daily duties. Unfortunately, customer service suffers here."
bad,Management not fair to employees on all levels. They hire team members and don't treat them with dignity and respect. Put a lot of pressure on employees. Management does not care about employees concerns.
bad,"Management doesn't work side by side with the associates, they don't lead by example. Lack of full-time, permanent staffing. Skeleton crew operation. Managerial responsibilities placed on the associates. More responsibilities than can be accomplished leading to burn out, and over stressed workers."
bad,"The company is a great company to work for BUT each individual store gets managed differently. Management is clueless especially because most of the time employees know more than them! Management does not follow the companies policies because its ""their store"" so they do as they please. Company offers great benefits but they have to come to each individual store and ask employees how they feel about their management team and clean up each store!"
bad,"I attended the March, 2018 job fair at a local store. The human resource manager placed me as a seasonal temporary at customer service desk based on my experience. A mandatory drug test was required at the job fair. I did not receive subsequent communication so I sent an email to the HR manager for status. An offer letter was sent with position and hourly rate information. One day of orientation was followed with computer based training for two to three days. One needs to be red vest certified to earn the privilege to wear the red vest. Training with an employee in the assigned area is how one learns the job responsibility. The weekly hours are assigned by a manager and are not consistent. Each week hours differ from days to shift time. Shift swaps are permitted but need approval. The position at the customer service desk requires an outgoing and patience individual. Job duties are (in no specific order): process returns, in-store orders, internet orders, phone inquiries, credit card applications and payments, settle all customer complaints (which are numerous), return all items to departments, fill water cooler bottle display, move all damaged items to receiving area placing on pallets, bring in outside carts and shopping carts, trash removal, and carpet vacuum at entrance. One can be expected on some days to do all this work solely. Employees frequently call in and do not report to work. When employees do not show up, expect to be called in to cover the open shift by a supervisor. When alone all job responsibility then falls on the employee for that shift without assistance."
bad,Balancing the tills and safe and at 9am go to lunch.  Than cover either or both head cashiers and customer service associate lunches.  Than after finish covering lunches than I try to go back to finish my paperwork.   Sometimes I need to research potential chargebacks.
bad,"The people that they hire are absolutely immature and useless. Poor management as far as communication and direction go. If you are not a favorite, you will never advance in this company."
bad,"At the Gilbert Lowes, store 2808, things all seem good and on the up and up at first but it fades quickly. There are several very good Service Managers in the store but they don't control very much. The few good ones do their best to correct and smooth over the very poor decisions and actions of the upper management and HR manager. In the time I have been there I have posted for 10+ other positions, all of which would have been a raise for me. I have been interviewed ONCE. The store management typically has their person in mind for posted positions and posting the position is just a formality. I've been told by associates with a lot of seniority that if you post for a position outside the store, the other store will call your store and ask about you which is normal, but almost always, at my store, the other store is told that the associate is on project and they won't release them so you don't even get an interview. I have personally experienced ""selective policy enforcement"", meaning I was told something I was doing or wearing or a request I made was against policy and to stop wearing or doing that or that is why your request was denied only to witness the exact same behavior from other associates go uncorrected and similar requests instantly approved. The general morale in the store is poor and from what I have seen most people don't like the company. The pay is fine for very young people just starting their working careers or for retirees filling in time. It's easy to stay there and mark time if you don't plan on going anywhere. For the people who actually need to make a"
bad,"Muy buena empresa mal enfocada por el personal que esta en gerencias, no hay apoyo ni empatia con los asesores."
bad,no communication between worker and management told was hired for fulltime but was labeled as seasonal was not told that while being seasonal that i still needed to apply to other positions in the job
bad,When i started working for lowes as an unload associate everything went OK.issues i ran into were lack of training there having to train myself to the job to the best of my ability became my responsibility.Towards the end of my employment they went under new management. i wanted to advance due to lack of income and hours and trying to obtain a livable wage.they did not see me as fit for advancement i tried 4 times but no one cared.
bad,"I used to work at this store a couple years back and I loved it! So I came back 2018, and everything went to doodoo . Management stopped caring, corporate changes the management structure, so they have less managers. The Manana gets they do have are overworked and have too much on their plate. When they are told that an employee‚Äôs mental health is dying because of another manager, they do anything or even say anything."
bad,"I was terminated from my job due to what they said was ""attendance"". I had used 7 of my sick days in the previous 12 months and I was told that this was excessive so I was let go. I did not have any warning about watching my sick day usage...I had no idea that 7 days in 360 days was excessive."
bad,"the store manager is fine but the rest of the managers are awful at their jobs, many issues with certain managers letting their employees that are personal friends get away with breaking rules, several employees including myself had problems with harassment from other employees that management never cared to address. Pay is great but not worth the stress"
bad,The schedule is the most grueling part of this job. You get 1 weekend off a month then get punished for it by working the next 14 out of 16 days after. People are quitting all the time. Not a job for long term unless you are single and dont have much of a life anyway. Their scheduling starts Sat-Fri so you are forced to work the next 7 days in a row. People have been complaining to corporate for years without any success.
bad,Can not run a store from your office on skeleton crews and expect good  numbers from surveys from customers. Employees get fed up doing others jobs and their job too.
bad,"In the beginning the job was good. I had a decent amount of hours and it had some flexibility. However as time progressed hours were decreased and workload was increased from one person doing a one job, to one person doing about 3 to 4 peoples jobs. Under staffing was a huge problem and the training was non existent. It was always ""you'll figure it out"" but it wasn't that simple. I did gain some knowledge from working for the company but an applicant would be better off looking elsewhere. I was not able to access any benefits and the HR did not know how to help in most issues"
bad,"I was harrassed by my immediate supervisor and some coworkers, making it a very unpleasant job to work for. When I asked for help, the human resource person took no action. It got unbearable that I had to quit."
bad,"Your day is typically filled with patching holes in departments left vacant from associates who do not wish to come to work, or vacancies left by a deteriorating staff due to cuts from the corporate level."
bad,"A very busy desk.. which I enjoyed"
bad,The problem with Lowes is the general management.  the line management try to do as much as possible within their constraints.  Standing on a cement floor does take a toll.
bad,Grabbed carts in the cold. Learned to help customers. Taught myself more areas of expertise without ever advancing. Wasnt given the tools to succeed. Moved on due to better advancement opportunities
bad,"Lowe's the company is decent, they have great benefits for full time employees. The main issue about Lowe's is the management on a micro level. The company is plagued by bias store managers who lie and deceive and put friends in places of management. This type of structure stops growth from hard workers, and when hard workers see no growth, this hinders the company. No hard worker will continue to work hard without any monetary value put next to their efforts. However the lowly workers that aren't managers are pretty cool, and the job isn't hard. It's chill."
bad,Managers feel the need to micromanage associates. I was told that most associates are stupid and can't think for themselves.  They couldn't treat experience employees differently because it would be unfair to the inexperienced ones. They would use my abilities when ever they needed but then treat me like was unpromotable when they didn't. Managers would brake company polices and safety rules left and right the treating you not to say anything.
bad,"Lowe's overall is a good company to work for, but like all major chain stores the work environment of each store is determined by the management and other teammates there. My location's management was subpar and only made my time there worse after factoring in the less than desirable clientele."
bad,The way things were done were changed on a whim with no communication. Nobody looks out for each other it has an everyone for themselves type mentality. A few nice people that end up covering for the not nice people to keep the place moving.
bad,"I was only a seasonal employee and this particular location was not the best. It was severely understaffed when I started working there until the time that I left. Customers would need help in other areas of the store and because I was unfamiliar with a lot of those products, it made it hard to offer excellent customer service. Some employees were very rude when it came to being helpful. Management was very poor. I hope that it has improved since I stopped working there."
bad,"A typical day included most things you would expect from a retail job(Customer Service, Stocking, Resets, etc.). Really great Co-Workers made working there fun most of the time. Unfortunately the Leadership team was poor in my opinion. They just seemed to not care and wanted to be able to sit in their office and not do anything. During the year and a half I worked there we had maybe one or two good managers who did not stay there long. From my understanding most Lowe's stores are not like this or at least that is what I was told by co-workers who had previous experience at other Lowe's stores. The hardest part of the job is trying to find most of the inventory. The store I worked at almost always had issues with that because they just put stuff up where ever it would fit and didn't keep track of where it was at which made it very difficult when a customer needed something that was in top stock because the items were often not where they were supposed to be. As long as you approach the job with some patience it's an ok place to work."
bad,"Too political and behind the scenes back stabbing was an everyday occurrence. No one that I worked with enjoyed their jobs here. In fact, I recall seeing people crying in the hallways of the office in Mooresville, NC. That didn't happen before the move from Wilkesboro, NC."
bad,"During my tenure at Lowe's the Corporate office would change its policy and management structure at least twice a year.  This policy sent mixed messages for those that wanted to advance.  They would implement multiple policies that we would have to ""get fully behind"" with the threat of disciplinary action if not fully supported.  Then within six months, they stop the program.  This could and did result in having to discipline multiple people I was in charge of at various times, who would not have been written up if they had just been hired six months later.  "
bad,"Let me tell you a little story about lowes, in two week they put me on for 4 days of work. They expect me to live off 4 days of work on basicly minimum wage, doing one of the hardest jobs on the facility."
bad,"My immediate supervisor was decent but the person that was responsible for training me had a lousy attitude and really hated being at work. His unwillingness to train me and constant negative attitude combined with an overall lack of any meaningful support from management made the prospect of a future career at this company a long term loss in my case. A few people there are decent but there's this perception that the Wetumpka location is inherently better than any in Montgomery but it's really only a case of volume that separates the two. There are some decent people to work with here but most are busy pushing their work off on you. If you have a high tolerance for toxic work environments, this is your ticket."
bad,My direct supervisor was very supportive but my business partner was a horrible human being. Work life balance was horrible. But I was paid more than most others in the field doing similar work.
bad,"Business is always changing, which is needed to keep pace with retail environment.  Company goal to help people love where they live or work, however company is struggling with results.  Company went from ditch to ditch from docking people as much as possible to wanting to be everybody's friend.  Company is behind when it comes to technology and drags when things need to change quickly.  Most managers lead by staying in the office, while the select few work hard everywhere, but are rewarded with more to do when plates are full."
bad,"When I first started in February of 2013, it was a GREAT place to work. There was real opportunity to advance there. I started as a seasonal hire and was able to work up to being a department manager. The store manager  who was there when I started really cared about everyone and made my store and the people there really feel like a ""work family"". "
bad,"OK, if you enjoy getting heat stroke, this is the job for you. You will be stuck at the outside lawn and garden registers for 3 or more hours, with no break. The front end manager will say that it won't happen again, but it will..;.THE SAME DAY"
bad,had to open or close  to department most of the time. training was very poor management  was not supported. it was hard not to just walk out some day. did like working with most of the customers
bad,pretty good company to work for. flexible schedule. good training material. the job is fun. like helping customers. management team needs improvement.
bad,I appreciated my opportunity to work for Lowe‚Äôs. However I wouldn‚Äôt work here again. Hours are not consistent. When the time came for people to be let go or hired on full time I wasn‚Äôt informed until last minute.  Other employees were notified in advance so they could seek over employment. I left job before I was notified either way to make sure I could continue to provide for my family.
bad,"There is no leadership, when it comes to management. No one takes any accountability or responsibility for problems within the store. There is unfair treatment and favoritism displayed. Which makes it difficult to advance and the overturn is very high."
bad,"When your salary, they own you.  Work overtime and don‚Äôt get paid.  They promote from team member.  No where to go as a coach.  Team members make more than their supervisors when the work some overtime."
bad,Lowes was not a bad place to work but the store and company are going through restructuring. My store had a high turnover when it came to Management and employees. Most of the associates and managers I met when I started we‚Äôre leaving or terminated. There was no employee development and opportunities to advance if you are not best friends with the managers. Between 2016-2018 the store has had 3 HRs. The best part of my job were the interactions with the customers and  employees. If you are looking to advance based on your work you can think again. The company culture has the best intentions but my particular store lacked great management. Cashiers worked 9 days straight before a day off which is no work/life balance.
bad,"Everyone knows that the corporate policies make little to no sense. Job satisfaction and environment really varies  based on your store management as there is no overall accountability beyond that level aside from the almighty dollar. They honestly do not care about their individual employees as a company, again it comes down to specific store management."
bad,dont ever work for lowes!! i worked for this company 20years and they fired me over a customer complaint that wasnt even my fault.they did not back me up or cared about my side of the story.lowes used to be a great place to work but not anymore.management terrible and they dont communicate well with employees.they have you doing a million things and when you ask for help they leave you hanging!! not a very good work enviroment.stretch you thin and dont care anymore.
bad,"Appears Corporate Lowes decision makers have dropped the ball! Hope they figure it out!! Loved the position I was hired for, however was promoted to a position with more responsibilities and the pay just wasn‚Äôt there."
bad,It was a good job in the beginning. As time went on corporate changes scuttled the company time and time again. The other problems were you would be told something different by everyone that has any sort of power or pull. The job I'm currently in is very physically oriented. In my 3 years of working for this company we've never had the tools that we require for the jobs we do making it incredibly difficult to complete our jobs properly which made a large portion of our customers upset.
bad,"Lowe's no longer cares about the associates, it's all about the bottom line and they don't care who they take down to save a buck! Tenured people slashed without so much as the bat of an eye. Loyal, hard working associates given more and more work and NO MORE compensation....Lowe's calls it ABSORBING responsibilities! Management is ruining this place, absolutely ruining it! Upper management and I mean CEO level, taking millions of dollars of bonuses every year while some associates get no pay raises for years. It's SHAMEFUL!"
bad,Management was alright didn't agree with a few of them but that isn't uncommon. But to the point of being told that i had to change my personality because it offended adults that i worked with was something else.
bad,"Store MANAGEMENT is the problem. Corporate office puts good policy in place, but little local managers decide they know better and destroy all morale and hope like it's their only mission on Earth."
bad,"associates are for the most part nice, but management does little and expect a lot.  take advantage of good workers and let others slide asn long as they are in the ""group"""
bad,"General manager @ this location is  N E V E R  there.... ,other managers do not take care of their respective departments... always in the computer room doing computer stuff, chit chatting.... when no one on a department and customer is waiting they rather call for an employee to help instead of  going themselves n actually do some work. PATHETIC. the store runs with no employees pretty much.... . no cashiers..... the money they made,  that is plenty... is because they are in a great location smack in the middle of a neighborhood.... but not because is a great place to  get customer service .... cause you can't find anyone in any of the departments."
bad,"The managers at the Lowes I was at were terrible. They were either completely incompetent, giant jerks, or just didn't care about anything. They were absolutely no help with anything that arose and were generally unpleasant to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,"Formerly a good company to work for, but has been going downhill over the last few years due to corporate decisions. Inventory management replenishment is controlled totally by the corporate offices with little input accepted at the local level."
bad,"You never get any Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day off. Can't get enough help which means you work a mandatory 5 days a week during busy season February to May."
bad,"Management was never on the same page and scatter brained at best... I believe every manager I had while I was there has been terminated or has quit. Most other employee's were friendly but lazy. Most important responsibilties fell on a select few, while others were allowed to be lazy and neglect their job tasks without any recourse or disciplinary action from management. Management did however punish the hard workers for not getting jobs done fast enough for their liking without actually having any knowledge of the work going into said task."
bad,A typical day at work was very busy and fast paced.  This location needs better management that not only cares about the customers but their employees also.  The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people.
bad,"Co-workers are okay but most aren't that bright. The managers have no idea what is going on with their team. No room for advancement since they just take out jobs without reason. The only good thing is the base pay. I started out at $10.25. However, to get a raise outside of your possible annual 25 cent raise is next to impossible. Their hours are terrible. I had more hours working seasonal, got promoted to part-time and was given less hours. It's almost always short staffed."
bad,Most of the employees and my head cashiers are fantastic. I have my regular customers that come to me all the time and I love them. They are what makes the job worth being here.
bad,"I can speak for all Lowe‚Äôs stores but the one in Renton, WA offer a low salary with no increase in pay if the minimum wage for the state goes up or if you are with them for more then a year!"
bad,Lowes was a really nice place to work the only thing was that they let people do wat they wanted to the managers would fuss at some people sor doing things and not the ones that they was friends with
bad,"Managers are not respected in the work place. They have HR making store decisions when coming to the hiring of casuals. They don't allow managers to do their job as managers. They talk about their culture and being a apart of a family when they are the exact opposite and treat people poorly.  "
bad,"poor associate/management relations. Management expected the world, way to many managers and always expecting more than can be accomplished, now this was years ago so this could have changed by now."
bad,"Great company, just need to have right managers to be successful.Not enough staff to support what the day to day tasks. If a sick call happens it puts everyone in a bind with no support in place."
bad,Management at the one i worked at was terrible. I often felt like i was back in high school and not a supposedly professional retail job. Also very low raises if you get one.
bad,"I honestly loved working there, but the fact of the matter is they cared more about there product than there people. Which was something I couldn't continue putting up with."
bad,"Hard to find help, no coverage.  Management does not back employees with customers per policy.  Employees work as a team to make up for management downfalls to make business run.  Wish regional staff would see that"
bad,Working for this company will drain you; physically and mentally. I was cross trained in several departments and used to cover other employee‚Äôs vacations‚Äîhowever I never had the chance to take one myself. I was kept at part time no matter how many different positions I applied to or how many interviews I partook in (which always went very well). They didn‚Äôt want to train someone to take my position so I was stuck even though I bent over backwards for this company. I received ONE raise and it was for 0.04$. They let good employees go and keep the incompetent ones and are somehow baffled by the poor morale. Managers are lazy and would rather sit around and talk as opposed to help on the sales floor / front end; and on top of that they‚Äôre extremely pretentious and condescending. If you‚Äôre lazy and have a bad attitude this is the company for you; if you work hard and are congenial think about applying to Home Depot or Ace instead. Make no mistake that Lowe‚Äôs always has a hidden agenda.
bad,"I worked for Lowe's in entry level management for more than ten years. Lowe's expected loyalty from those they employ, but felt no moral duty to respond in kind."
bad,They are growing and changing. No longer a great place to work. They are following a coorporate model that has failed teerible for Home Depot and a few other companies that have since abandoned the model.
bad,"The management is terrible. Know that going in. Whatever your job is, you're on your own. There is no training, no mentoring, no baby steps. You're thrown in to the deep end of the pool, on day one, and you either sink or swim. Hard work doesn't pay off at Lowe's. Knowing the right people does."
bad,"It was an ok job for a short time. interesting to meet new people. Brain dead job takes no brains to do. Program keeps telling me to add more information and that's about it. I was a sales associate, Not much more to tell."
bad,"Save yourself some time and stress, don't work for Lowes. It really is a stressful job with no free time to live your life outside of it. Management is poor and they do not care about the employee."
bad,"overall, working for lower's I thought they cared about their employees but after I got injury on the job I found out their true colors and how they really treat their employee and so called family."
bad,"A lot of work, with too much turnover of employees.   With high turnover, consistently training the basics. Had start times of 4am and 1 pm all in the same week."
bad,Lowes took it upon itself to internally destroy its own management system. There aren't enough managers to keep a store running and both customers and employees now get overwhelmed quickly.
bad,"Even though Lowes tries to show it is there to sell products to people which it does, but in an environment that is souring to the soul. You help five people in a row and then one is still not happy with your answers. There are great employees to work with and good times can be had but overall it is a level beyond in the format of retail."
bad,"Management was not good when I worked there. The work did not result in fair pay, you work a lot more for what you get paid for. Have to watch out for many people who steal and you're never actually working what you applied for unless you're a cashier. "
bad,"recent changes have eliminated Lowes as a place to call a career.  opportunities have been eliminated, people let go and new structure is all about paying less, promoting inexperience (to pay them less) and replace positions with ones paying less (past $16+ jobs now around $13.  Mgt jobs at $19 now $16) recent promotions have been the least experienced people."
bad,Very bad managers and work environment. Fast paced and very rude head cashiers. I worked in the garden center and was often forgotten about around break time.
bad,"...Flexible and inconsistent hours. Low pay for job description. Lack of communication between management and employees. Job duties include processing returns, internet orders, customer transactions."
bad,"Loved my job and was exceptional at it. Was initially hired full time to find out at orientation I was seasonal  for 90 days and took another year and a half to be full time,  and the management was lacking,  very unprofessional,  treated me as if I were a ok STUDENT  with no brain.  Talk down to a cashier in front of customers,  and cuss you behind doors.  Hours were cut dramatically no matter how professional and good of a job I did. No loyalty in the company and front end management."
bad,"Lowe's is expecting one employees to perform the work of 2 or more people.  Difficult to provide excellent service when pulled in too many directions  Management is too concerned with how they look to corporate to care about the employees and how to better help them achieve sales and customer service. Scheduling issues, only had one ""real weekend"" per month...Had no life. Sad state of affairs there."
bad,Unfortunately the current climate at Lowe's is toxic due to poor leadership and lack of a clear strategy.  The lack of technology and tools to perform essential duties puts a strain on employees which creates poor customer experiences.
bad,Lowe's corporate management does not care about the sales staff. Top management gives themselves large raises where sales staff may get ten to twenty-five cents per hour. Dot spend all that extra money filling your gas tank. This was a smack in the face for me I have always received a dollar or more an hour raise.
bad,"No advancement possibilities, management discriminates against women, they took all the incentive away when they eliminated the dept managers, they work have you open 1 day then close the next"
bad,Happy to help customers find the answers to their questions and provide good customer service but it is not a dream job. Would recommend to college students
bad,"In 2017 the company changed the management staffing going from 13 to 7. We all have to do more work and more responsibility for the same pay. It is not the same Company anymore. "
bad,Unsupportive management. Antiquated computer system/training system. Unfair practices between departments. Only advancement is through ability to befriend management.
bad,"Lowe's puts a lot of pressure on its employees to provide great customer service, but then does not provide the tools to do so. Employees are paid very little for the work they do (usually a couple jobs at once)."
bad,this place unbelievable prejudiced on my break i was in the break room only eating my lunch and the exact words that was said because i was sitting there i don't know why tell even work here we need a police officer sitting back here even though me and people that look like me would constantly be called to help them same people when they are behind and if we refuse we are punished honestly if your looking to work here be prepared to tolerate unfair work labor
bad,management suck no one is on one accord management gossips the hr runs her mouth about everything confidential the pay was about the only decent thing I experienced there
bad,"poor management, not much training, poor pay/no benefits. I'm part time but I work over 40 hrs a week fairly often. they said I'd get 2 weeks notice for my schedule but that rarely happens and when it does they'll change it without talking to me, sometimes within a few days of my shift. very stressful and frustrating. Some of the drivers and other employees they hire are useless and cause many problems but they won't fire them. Overall it just a mess."
bad,Typically change managers incessantly in order to improve financial performance.  Remove higher paying individuals for less seasoned and less paid without providing reasonable training.  Manage from crisis to crisis.
bad,"The pay is good for the job, and current management flexible about work hours; however, constant organizational changes and management decisions made in a vacuum make it a stressful environment. Four layoffs in less than a year, and many IT jobs moving to India give no sense of job security. This also limits opportunities for career advancement within the company."
bad,"Under staffed, over demanding, unfair wages, upper management is a click.  unrewarding and ungrateful.  they will work you to the limit which is never enough and then flush you down the toilet."
bad,With all the new changes that have happened with management and job positions going away the job has become more and more stressful. Management is often too stressed to help fellow associates and fellow associates are too stressed to want to help out anyone else that is not in their department.
bad,"honestly, don't work here. The management is awful and turns things around on you. HR manager is very irresponsible and doesn't know what she's doing. whole store is based on favoritism."
bad,I've worked for Lowes for 14 years in a management positions. The past 2 years or so they have made drastic changes to their staffing matrix. Each time they spin it to us in a way that makes it seem like it's what we have to do to take care of our customers when that's just not the case. Basically they have reduced full time better paying positions with what was supposed to be more part time positions. Only problem is we have yet to gain any part timers. Staffing levels are at an all time low and you spend your whole shift just putting out fires and can not ever find the time to do the neccessities. To make matters worse the reliable hardworking associates we once had were sick of dealing with the stress of not having enough help and have left. We can never make our bonuses because our service levels are too low. There simply isn't enough help for our customers. I wish I was one of the lucky ones who were laid off.
bad,Management doesn't know what's going on. Poor communication between management. The new system rolls out and they laid off half of the management and made poor choices hiring the 5 managers they do have.
bad,constantly asked to do more work without any acknowledgement of good work done. favoritism with managers and employees. being monitored every second of the day.
bad,"I was lucky enough to get out before the massive changes they have made.  That being said in the short time with the company I worked in two different states and experienced the culture and morale drop dramatically in each store.  Management was often detached from the sales floor and showed little concern for the employees.  That being said there were plenty of chances to promote at the time if willing to relocate and work hard, and the pay was pretty good for retail based work."
bad,"A typical day of work started with about 10-20 deliveries with several more usually being added through out the day. "
bad,"Most management has their own personal agenda that has nothing to do with really improving the department and they are constantly changing the manager they seem to fire the good ones for ridiculous reasons and keep the power happy ones that really doesn't know what management is."
bad,"They can be great, but the management is a revolving door. Eventually, you will get someone who thinks that leadership means riding you like a pony. The work shifts are literally all over the map, forget about work-life balance."
bad,"Each and every employee is held under and unrealistic microscope."
bad,Management does not communicate with employees as I believe they should. An email does not substitute eye contact. The restructuring of the management and store associates is killing the work environment and putting too much pressure on customer service associates.
bad,"Lowes is a good place for young people to start their careers in retail. "
bad,"Lowes spent its time back in the late 2007 to 2009 time span looking to get rid of the older employees through made up reasons to terminate them. They have effectively gotten rid of the knowledgeable employees to save on payroll. In effect the customer service and general knowledge has suffered tremendously because they hire low wage workers and work them to death. "
bad,Freight usually not ready for me to load and delivery to time sensitive job sites. Management not worried about customer complaints until corporate level gets involved. I loved my job as a tractor-trailer driver. I hated having to do other peoples' jobs to order to get my own started for the day.
bad,Lowe's was once a great place to work. However as time goes on it has become apparent that the company is becoming less customer oriented and more task oriented. Customer service feels like a low priority and problems with simple solutions are not being addressed. Management has lost touch with their associates and communication was already bad four years ago and has gotten worse over the years. The job itself is enjoyable but the mistakes of corporate and upper management make working at Lowe's a borderline nightmare.
bad,"Work consisted of showing up, handling cash, and just doing my job. I learned how to use the genesis system. The hardest part of the job was having an inconsistent work schedule. The best part of the job was getting cashier of the month twice."
bad,Lowes cares more about the bottom line than employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the team members under my guidance. Corporate management is out of touch with what really goes on daily in stores.
bad,I cant stand working here especially with job security going out the window. And you don't get paid enough for the amount of work you have to do. Management is okay I mostly just mind my business. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home.
bad,"The experience I got working at Lowes was not a great one. Not saying the company was bad, but the location I worked at was not good at all. I felt depressed working there."
bad,"this company in itself takes care of their people.  However, my experience was not made a good one.  the people in the lowes that i worked for seemed to always be looking for someone to target and attack.  i have never been so eager to resign.  awful management. awful human resource personnel on campus.  just a nasty experience all the way around."
bad,"Corporate restructure is leaving many without jobs. Managers are doing less and less. Employees are not being held responsible for jobs/duties they are asked to complete. Employees not being followed up with as to why their jobs are not being completed. Hours are spuratic, and hard to balance a personal life outside of work."
bad,This was my first job out of high school. I can't really complain much for that reason. They seem to care more about their customers than their employees. Shop here don't work here.
bad,"Worked for 4  years, Very experience with store manager but assistant managers  were supportive however terrible coverage on the floor for breaks and lunches. sometimes neighbor department colleagues go for lunch and breaks for ever and you are forced to watch 2 to 3 departments by your self leaving you stressed and frustrated. No room for advancement if you are not store manager's favourite."
bad,"corporate does not care about its employees. they keep restructuring jobs and people's lives. all for wall street and their own grubby pockets. if you want advancement, look elsewhere."
bad,"The  environment is  very unstable, always extreme tension,  their is no fairness across the departments. Some departments    can attend  courses  for carer advancement, some are not allowed to at all, so you get the feeling you are trapped  and  makes for a  horrible environment  to be in."
bad,"The store was previously well run, but as a store that trains store managers, we get new ones every 2 years.  The most recent one needed more time before getting here.  There is little regard from him or middle management (and forget any higher) for people below them.  The restructuring that others have mentioned has made things worse for us lower life forms."
bad,"start at 5:30am half hour before open. wnen closed required to stay one hour after closed.  "
bad,The management has good working knowledge of the system but not what is in it. When I talk to a manager it is tough repeating myself for every manager
bad,"I was pregnant while working here and was always being talked down to by management if i needed to use the restroom, i was given a note from my dr. to have a stool at my station because of issues being on my feet constantly was causing and management simply threw out the note. another women left to have her baby shortly before i had mine and management demanded she return 3 weeks after or lose her job, she was breastfeeding so she would pump on breaks and management often threw out her breastmilk which was in a sealed and secure container and told her she could not pump at work, she eventually quit. two and a half months before my due date my hours were drastically cut down to 5-10 hours a week, which is not enough to live on."
bad,Lowe's is going through a lot of change.  The culture avoids conflict and currently there is a lack of trust with leadership.  Work performance and talent has not been used when reducing the workforce.
bad,"fair place to work "
bad,This is a full retail company. Must keep this in mind when applying. With recent layoffs and restructure the work environment has declined massively. Very hard now for advancement to a manager position.
bad,"Job is focused on you doing more. If you do a great job you never get rewarded, even if you're told you do, and moving up is next to impossible. Management needs a extreme makeover, too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Some managers rather just sit back and bark orders rather than explain your task. I've closed on multiple occasions and when the CSAs are ready to leave managers will say no we need to stay and clean however they will stay on their phones up front rather than lead. Needs a leadership environment and more respect earned, if that is achieved then the store would be great."
bad,This great for a part time job. At my job if you speak your mind they will either plot to fire you or make sure that you do not advance in the store by any means possible. At lot of favoritism goes on at my store. and they do not like women at my store. They think we do not know how to do anything!!! My store doesnt do full time because it messes with our payroll. Key word for if my store managers payroll isnt right he will not receive his 15 bonuses of the year. I can complain all day about lowes.
bad,When you make a mistake like forget something or not do something exactly as someone told you to do the task they act like the world is ending and its all your fault.
bad,"Had a great store manager at the time.  If you were hard working and goal oriented, you could set yourself on the management track. Good experience with customers and their needs."
bad,The work is hot and heavy. People who have been there the longest run the 'coaches' they stand around talking while the new people do all the work. The coaches go and talk with them sometimes. Makes the atmosphere unenjoyable to work in. High turnover rate.
bad,The job was fine till the lay off of department managers. The new service managers are stressed  out and taking it out on the lower employees. they also ask you to do more work with out anymore help.
bad,Lowes is understaffed and underpaid and the people they hire or depending on their job they show up and they want if they show up at all this is something strange  store moral is at a all time low.
bad,"Management is very young and inexperienced, very short staffed, will push you to your limits and beyond. Could be a good place to work if they could just calm down and treat people with more respect."
bad,"To many bosses telling you what to do when they dont even know what you were previously told to do by another supervisor! Pay could be better, and the customers made this job excellent."
bad,"Best advice i can give, don't get to attached to the place it is going down, management is something that needs work depends on the location you work at."
bad,"WOULD NOT RECOMEND WORKING THERE THE scheduled hours are not set in ston witch gives you no life. plus the demand to make sales vs, helping coustomers is very unfair to people needing help."
bad,The store was top heavy with too many chiefs and no indians to help with customer service.  Since the culture of the store is supposed to be customer focused it was not....the customers often did not get what they ordered within the time frame it was ordered or was told it was out of stock and did not know when it would arrive.
bad,"The company has ""evolved"" in such a way that there is no room for advancement at the store level. There are opportunities to receive bonuses, but new corporate rules have made it nearly impossible to achieve."
bad,Worked at Lowes for 16 years. Was written up and finally fired for leaving the floor only 2 feet to steady a display. Have witnessed actions like this several times over the years where someone had to leave the floor or to stand on something. Witnessed this by regular employees like myself and even managers! My store manager did nothing to help. 16 years of dependable service did not mean a single thing. Lowes is NOT a place to work if you want to make a career. Management thinks about management and the bottom line!
bad,"Not a good place to work. Management showed favortism towards employees, and disliked hardworkers that wanted to improve the business as a whole. When an employee had a new idea, it was dismissed without even reviewing the potential benefits."
bad,"Management is not willing to support you when you approach them. Promotions are not given to the people who actually work for it, its more hand-picked. Hardly get any weekends off."
bad,"No one knows whats going on, very contradicting instructions by different managers, to many people try to run the show. would not recommend this lowes to anyone"
bad,There was always work to do but not enough people to do the job. This made the job stressful. Good experience but hard to get ahead  & further career.
bad,"I would arrive at 9pm and work till 6am Sunday through Friday usually. I would move pallets with a hand jack to necessary locations of items to place either on shelf or up above for storing. I did not work with another person, so no socializing was available to learn from other coworkers about Lowe's policies. If I had a question, I would leave with day supervisor for answer due to night supervisor not being available due to missing work or coming in late."
bad,"Loved working there sometimes  you can't balance your everyday life. On a rotational schedule. No set hours customers are very demanding , you'll always have something to do as the store operates with hardly anyone in each department so you may have to cover more than 1 area at a time"
bad,I was an FSA for four years. I was recognized‚Äã nationwide for my job performance and the savings I was responsible for by going above and beyond. Then I was involved in a car accident. I tried working through my recovery but couldn't maintain my normal work schedule. Two months later I was terminated for a charge that should not result in an immediate termination.
bad,"Cycle counts"
bad,You will live there if you are salary.  Very stressful major pressure.  Ask for training you will get the minimum but not enough to do your job comfortably.   I learned there are better jobs out there.  The system is as old as the building 15+ years.  poorly maintained.  It is always breaking down. The team members is the only positive thing about the company.
bad,I have worked for Lowe's for several years and worked my way up to the current position of service manager.  This position was created after the position of department was eliminated.  Lowe's eliminated half to two-thirds of all management positions in each store so there is very little room for upper management movement.  Most stores operate with very few full-timers: part-time and seasonal help is where the company is headed.  The pay isn't great and management is overworked.  Most employees are disengaged.
bad,"They espose taking care of their employees, but do not show it.  Great benefits if you last long enough to get them.  Lots of great people, but the leadership is terrible."
bad,"There were too much favoritism. You might apply for a position though qualified, but if you're not in the 'clique' you get over looked by someone under qualified. When the under qualified becomes your boss, you will be doing your job and the boss's job as well. It was like walking on egg shells; management was inconsiderate and rude not only to employees but customers. Though the company gives all employee a 10% to use on products, the employees could not buy clearance items until after a waiting period. We were told that the customers have to be able to view the products first. During the busy season, work hours are extended to 32+ if your part-time; but, after that your hours are not guaranteed 20 or more. It's dropped to 10hrs a week if you're part-time. The only great thing that I can say about that company is that they are serious about the safety of their employees and customers."
bad,On several occasions management would take back items broken by customers.  They even have taken back items that they knew were sold at a discount and gave customer full credit because the customer said they would call corporate.  The management team treat the money and assets like they are not theirs.  They just didn't care.
bad,"When I was hired I was led to believe that this work place was all about team work and family, as I have realized in the past 8 month it is very unstable and there is a lot of favoritism.  with all the layoffs going on I have watched this company let ( families ) down. there is no secure future with this company."
bad,Management at any given Lowes store is very hit or miss. They don't care about the employee at all besides giving them a 10% product discount. Would not recommend working for Lowes
bad,"A typical workday would start with reading emails, making our rounds, then making an action plan on what we had to accomplish during the day. While doing this, you are often bouncing back and forth to handle customer service issues, open gates, getting overrides, etc. The hardest part of working at here was that there was not standard procedure. The most enjoyable part of the job-the ability to be on a rotation every 4 weeks."
bad,Start working at fire wheel Lowe's in Garland Texas in the lawn and garden department.  I enjoyed working in the lawn and garden department and would prefer to have stayed in the department. The manager decides to move me into plumbing department with no knowledge or experience in plumbing. They did not properly trained me or give me any training in this department. Then when I cannot meet customers expectations they write me up. I was hired in as a customer service representative not a specialist and expecting me to do a specialist job.  Unprofessional managers and set you up to fail.
bad,"Working at lowes was nice, But the fact that when the store manager was gone, and I came in to work and got laid off. There was little to no communication between management."
bad,"feed you free lunches sometimes busy place to work "
bad,"The overall company was fairly decent.  The company maintains flexibility with constant work availability and opportunities to grow."
bad,"For the pay and job expectations if you add the demands of the customer on top, its not worth it. The way the schedule is you feel like you never get any time off."
bad,Management is so unorganized and nobody is on the same page. I liked being a part of the delivery team but hated being at the store due to poor management. Also they dont care if they break company policies to get the job done.
bad,The management does not care about their employees.  They are not interested in employees life style.  All they care about is meeting quotas.
bad,Lowes was a fun job and maybe one of the few i like to work at. and got to have many different jobs there. Money was good and benefits were also better then most jobs
bad,store lacks team work. Management will micro-manage their department managers.great pay but low moral.Company benefits are good.
bad,underpaid backbreaking work. Micromanaged many employees cheat to meet quotas. They monitor every move you make and are constantly around micromanaging telling you to move faster
bad,"Lowe's in Columbia, SC got a new store manager within the past 6 months and has left this store in a complete mess accusing long time employees of things they haven't done and I'm talking about the top sales person for this store. She's retaliated on an employee after 8 years of leading this store in sales all b/c he went to HR on her. Contractors have already starting leaving b/c of Stephanie, the store manager. I'd say Lowe's should do an extensive investigation on her."
bad,Work was fun for the first few months then it just went straight down hill for 2 years. Upper management didn't care about any of us and on a few occasions where I got extremely sick I got told I was not allowed to call off by upper management and received threats from other employees and management wouldn't even take the time to hear about it. Your tasked with a list for work that requires 10 workers and they'd only have 5 of us on nights and refused to hire any more than that and our store received the highest amount of freight in our whole district. I did have some great co workers and learned a few new things but the benefits take over half your check and the hours for a night shift are terrible. I wouldn't recommend anyone to do nights for Lowes
bad,"Although this job isn't physically hard, it is very mentally exhausting. There are not enough Supervisors to help when you need something and they just kind of toss you out to the wolves."
bad,Ability to deal with difficult clients. Met/exceeded sales expectations for myself as well as the department. Great communication and negotiation skills. Loves relationship building among the customers.
bad,"Lowe's  has several positive reasons for working there, at least in S Scottsdale.  The store employees are the best,  with the exception of the dead weight,  the employees go out of their way helping each other. If you are not wanting to lift heavy freight everyday,  turn around, not for you, if you are opposed to being forcefully locked in the store at closing and no matter how exhausted you are,  the management will force you to stay & unload freight,  if you insult managements ego by protesting your rights,  you will be talked about and possibly find your daily work harder.  Did i mention the high turnover , slow rehire, customers consistly going off on you because no coverage.  Oh almost forgot the negativity of asst store manager ,  who knows it all nothing & will lie to you to avoid any responsibility on his part.  If this sounds like a good fit ,  you will be shaking your head in no time & finding another job."
bad,"A typical day in Lowes kitchen dept. requires you to make adjustments at a moments notice. This can be difficult for the kitchen specialist because your train of thought and concentration is consistently interrupted and this is a key ability needed for creative and excellent design work AND sales to be done; customers find this to be highly disturbing. Many potential associates and customers often lament,"" I could not do your job"" or ""How can you do your job with all of these interruptions"". You either learn how to perform this way or find another department to work in or quit. Management found this acceptable. As a kitchen specialist, you will have to learn how to work with little to no assistance from others and will be required to help others in their departments.There will be NO reciprocity. The most satisfying aspect of the work is helping customers make their projects a reality. It has taken at least 30 years of lost productivity and good will and, therefore, profit before the ""big box"" stores responded to the systemic marketing challenges and problems of marketing kitchen projects in the aforementioned manner."
bad,"the people are great, the customers are appreciative of my help, I really like the hours I work, I get to spend time with my family. I feel the pay should be equal to work you do. Management should be more supportive."
bad,"I worked in the warehouse which was very fun but had to deal with 5 different managers who all had a different opinion on how to do things which got complicated. Hours fluctuated constantly and also got very confusing. My last month i was told that me and 3 others are being terminated and were not offered another position. I was there for only a year but the 3 others had been there for 3 and 4 years, we all had all the licenses for heavy equipment in the store and were very valuable to the store."
bad,"Very political workplace. If you are not with the good ole boy system, you will not last long. The benefits are good but the compensation is not that great."
bad,"Since ASMs are the only salaried positions below the store manager you can expect the worst schedules imaginable and zero work-life balance.  Decent pay, diminishing benefits and little chance for advancement due to a culture which overwhelmingly favors hiring former store managers externally.  You will literally be given a key and security code and sent on your way with increasing expectations and decreasing support. The corporate culture is not even remotely in sync with the reality of day to day store operations and the restructuring 5 years ago gutted training programs and left stores with no ASM authority structure when the SM is out."
bad,"Great Atmosphere, Great prices,. Great employees to work with as a team. The hardest part of the job was upper management and their integrity"
bad,"Overall, the managers were good people who cared about the workers around them. However, the job itself was somewhat ridiculous considering the routine work that was involved day in and day out."
bad,This job has very good benefits. It is a great job for someone who needs to do something for the time being. I wouldn't recommend it as a career. Feels like you're just a number here. I want a job where im valued.
bad,Nice place to work. However Job security for management is less  than stellar. Hence the poor retention. Note this is Retail... and Lowe's is a typical Retailer. Profit is payroll... leverage leverage leverage.
bad,Basically walk up and the down aisle straightening products on sales floor and helping customers with home improvements questions.
bad,"Pay and benefits are good. That's pretty much where it ends. this company has ZERO training programs and very little organization. You are literally thrown to the wolves from day 1. the company is also overly complicated in how it's run on a day to day business. Very outdated computer systems and running basic reports and even doing basic retail daily functions (I.E. change an onhand count or order an item) takes an act of congress. Their inventory system and distribution system is extremely inefficient and you can be expecting to be on the phone with either the IT department or a merchandise buyer for hours on end on a weekly basis, There's also a ton of politics to play for advancement. the district manager level is full of sleazy used car salesman mentality people who expect the same mentality from their Store Managers and ASMs. And the only ""good"" store managers and good stores are the ones where that totally kiss up to the DM on a daily basis. No room for different management styles or different personalities either. You have to be a hopped up fake over the top ""sales driver"" running down customers like a leach to prove yourself as a leader with this company. Also as a manager you have no real authority to do anything as far as holding your associates accountable. HR has far too much power and all discipline goes through them. Just to write someone up, you have to write three to our statements and submit it in formal writing. By the time it's approved, you have the pleasure of writing an associate up for something they did a month ago, making you look like a total idiot."
bad,The manager staff are the worst. Its bad enough we have to deal with some bad customer. But dealing with bad manager is the hardest.
bad,Loved working with the public and giving knowledge on all the services that the company had to offer.  I had great co workers and the benefits were really comparable.  There is still a lot of training due to the new associates due to the high turn over that typically happens in retail.
bad,This company is unorganized. It is hard to advance unless you're friends with the managers. The scheduling is HORRENDOUS! Not a good job for moms with young children because you will never get time with your family and to take care of you household. I am only there for the pay and benefits but it is not worth missing my husband and kids all the time.
bad,Management is no help.  Unfair to employees.  Shows a lot of favoritism.  Have to learn how to do everything on my own.  People are not encouraged to help others.
bad,It was fine working at Lowes before I had kids but once I had my son they showed their true colors in not wanting to work with me on schedule restraints.
bad,"I worked at the new contact center in Indianapolis. The supervisors do not know anything, and there are no advancement opportunities if you are African American. They do not mean what they say. Worst center I've ever been employed."
bad,"The work itself was easy, but the people that you were forced to work with were unbearable. Misogynistic, racist, r*pe apologist coworkers, most of whom barely pulled their weight most nights. A typical night at work would involve splitting into our own departments to work freight, then scrambling around to finish the freight that unfinished departments had left, usually bringing us right up until opening. Constantly berated for having overtime, could have used more coworkers."
bad,Worked at Lowes for over two years. I found management very inflexible and would make things more difficult than they had to be. Management likes to have employees on a string and place associates in a position to make them feel like their job is in danger.
bad,"the less work a person does the more management is hesitant about correcting the problem, they just push it off to other hard working employees. All of which make everyone unhappy."
bad,"daily, weekly,monthly checklist, reviewed overages and shortage on the register, safety meetings, manager meetings, CCTV review for shrink and safety incidents, trained managers to customer service associates on policies and procedures.  Enjoined building relationships with co-workers in multiple stores.  Hardest part of my job was finding an issue, reporting it to management and getting them to corrected it.  Most enjoyably was making a difference with safety and shrink culture with the associates."
bad,"Lowe's is a stressful environment to work it however, you do learn a lot of wonderful traits from working there. The employees are wonderful and welcoming and create a great family environment. The management team gives a very uncomfortable vibe. Working Lowe's is overrated. Many workers are over worked and underpaid."
bad,The loss prevention program here is a joke. They prefer the LP let someone walkout of the store with the product and report the loss as opposed to stopping the product from leaving.
bad,If you like working outdoors and helping people this is great! You start out as full time and hours get cut almost in half as season slows down. It is Seasonal and as such it is not a job to rely on. Hardest part is dealing with customers who think because you are a sales associate that you should know everything. Co-workers are great! Another thing is there is Very little training...so you kinda are on your own. Schedule sucks never a constant schedule all different hours...no benefits.
bad,I really did not like working at Lowe's due to constantly daily schedule changes so I had no idea what free time I would have to plan to do things out of work. The management ran the store poorly. I enjoyed my co-workers and the physical aspect of the job itself.
bad,A typical day of work involved assisting customers with there home improvement projects such as helping them locate there material and giving them advice for what they would need. I learned a great deal of information on construction and some electrical and plumbing procedures as well. The management was very lax. there are plenty of days where i won't see a manager except maybe for a moment. My co-workers seem to be fine although frustrated at times. The hardest part of the job is the demanding physical labor. the most enjoyable part is the customers appreciation after you've helped them figure out a problem.
bad,"Most of the time I worked at customer service answering phones, directing calls to the appropriate department. Processed returns, filled incoming internet orders, kept customer service neat and organized . Took and processed payments for Lowe's credit card. Filled and processed credit applications through computer system. Some paper and filing. Management is always changing here. The one's that have stayed have great strain and burden on them. But, seem to work very hard. Love my co-workers, most are very easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is when you are at customer service, and the only only to do the job of many. I can do it, don't get me wrong. But I felt the needs of the customer where not being met. Best part of the job is the customers! Some are amazing people that love to do projects, and love to share the stories of doing them."
bad,"Good workplace with amazing supervisors who got your back no matter what, BUT corrupt  upper management and HR.."
bad,This was a horrible experience all the way from the store manager down. Was not treated as a person they was always made out to be wrong. then was being mistreated because i am the son of someone who left on bad tems. was highly mistreated doesnt wish on anyone.
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for just a short time before buying my own business. I was trained to cut keys, tile, glass,  carpet and padding, blinds, and mix paint.  My first day on floor was left alone to cover isles 1- 13.  Cleaning products, cutting blinds and ordering, mixing paint. I was on the floor for 3 hrs. and was told this doesn't happen."
bad,"Overall not a good place to work, co-workers all unhappy with job, moral is low in store and management is nonexistent, as store managers and assistant store managers fail to help employees with simple tasks when needed, or to help with customer conflict.  Hardest part of the job was having a lack of employees to help on the sales floor, and lack of support from upper management."
bad,work work work... no breaks... always wanted me to work on my days off along with not keeping thier word.. my co-workers were okay to work with.. The hardest part was poor management and rude customers..
bad,"i mostly have to stand at the door and watch for shop lifters not too much to do during the day but stand around, if you are able to work on the sales floor than you will have stuff to do"
bad,"typically during the winter months there isn't a lot to do i would be inside helping with outdoor power equipment, during the summer its great you dont even have time to take a break"
bad,great place to work good hours. great pay just management micro manage too much
bad,pays decent but there is no room for advancement unless you move off.
bad,"Job culture among employees actually performing daily duties is good, but senior management mentality is very poor, and this comes from almost ten years of experience at Lowe's. Corporate mentality is an archaic ""good 'ol boys club"" with huge gender pay gap. Regardless of phenominal work history and experience, women here get paid less for doing their job as well as carrying the weight of slacking, typically male employees. The hardest part of the job is working much harder to prove oneself after yet another manager has been dismissed from his position. Rapport with immediate co-workers is particularly beneficial to team building as well as enjoyable and building customer relations and increasing repeat business is the most exciting aspect"
bad,People blaming other people for things they were responsible for.  Management had no clue on how to run the place people had no structure.  Coworkers were lazy never finished the work lists.  Helping out the customers and giving A1 customer service was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Management was okay and the employees were not very encouraging
bad,"Not only the eviroment is based on personal preferances, its bases on willing to accept the work that you're assigned."
bad,Management to much like Walmart mentality Do it my way or the highway. No proper description of any jobs just made up by each different manager.
bad,"long days in the heat with little relief if any scheduled. management is not seen unless you call them to answer customer complaints. Some co-workers were like family, others not so much. the most enjoyable part was the regular customers."
bad,Hired in as seasonal and only get 10-28 hrs a week. Not happy with such low hrs.
bad,This company was easy to work for but they do not listen to their employees.  They do not work on developing employees.
bad,Lowes does not appreciate their employees. Favortism is a huge part of the organization and is not fair
bad,"I worked at Lowe's for 7 years and enjoyed working with my co-workers. My work day was never the same although I had a check list I followed, I was constantly getting pulled away for other issues that needed to be addressed. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was being able to accomplish what I wanted to get done during my work day due to the added demands that needed attention. My most enjoyable part would be that I enjoyed all the customers and being able to give them outstanding customer service regardless what I was in the middle of doing."
bad,"This job offers a competitive salary, but there really isn't any opportunity for advancement.  They promise you tuition reimbursement, but are only willing to pay a thousand dollars towards tuition."
bad,they pay you almost nothing and give you all these promises they cant deliver. They put you in situation and work you to death jobs that take 5 people you by yourself.
bad,"Management is a joke.  The only way to advance in this company is to suck up.  They do not care if you have surgery or family issues.  They turned their back on an employee who had cancer and tried to fire her.  Employees who have been there for years and are great workers get overlooked for promotions. They promote people who have been there all of 3 months. The turn over rate of employees is very high. Management has no problem with yelling at you in front of customers. If you have a disablity they do not care.  It is very tough to get a raise. People who are just hired make more than others who have been there for years. Managers will lie and blame you for mistakes to make themselves look good.  The HR manager is never in the store, good luck trying to get ahold of her. The pay was not worth it."
bad,"I worked at the pro service desk, which dealt with contractors. Worked register, OSHA  Trained, worked all departments of the store, helped any customer in any needs, went out in the field to gain new customers. Ran a extensive credit program. Quoted estimates, learned a lot of computer training. Made telemarketing calls daily trying to bring in more business. Had to got through a weekly tutorial system. Management never said hello, good morning, it was all about numbers. Most coworkers were great but they preach unity but I would only really trust one coworker. Hardest pat of the job was selling credit. When your sales were up."
bad,Review and good job to get by in school but not a job towards career.
bad,"it isnt the greatest place to work they have horrible supervisor and deserves to be FIRED.  all he does is sit on his butt all day doing nothing. if u ask for a locker u will NEVER get one. he is a lair n if u work to hard to tries to get u fired. how could a ""PROFESSIONAL"" company keep a lazy person and lair there. i was a really good worker did everything i was suppose to WHEN i was suppose to and i got along with everybody. word of advise if u ever work for them if they take you to a room and ask u questions like how u like this job, what else would u like to do...ect. MAKE SURE THEY PUT UR ANSWERS DOWN BC THEY PUT WHAT EVER THEY WANT TO PUT DOWN. oh and keep a track of ur hours they rip u off and wont pay u for weeks out of a time."
bad,"Once arriving at work, I would sign out a store phone, greet everyone as I waded to my department. I would walk down each aisle within my department to see what items needed to be down stocked. Most of the time, it was only me working in my department. The volume of traffic of customers in plumbing was most of the time busy. I constantly engaged with customers everyday. The presence and support of management was low most of the time unless something major had occurred. One of the hardest experience is not being adequately trained by store managers, as well as department manger. However, the opportunity to offer great customer service to customers and employees was always fun."
bad,"Everyone here was always tense and the work environment was very hostile. Customers were often rude bringing your whole day down, and it was difficult to spend a whole day without getting yelled at by somebody."
bad,"Lowes has spent the last 10 years trying to be the WalMart of Home Improvement, setting aside every basic rule and business plan needed to be successful in the Construction business. Working for them is a challenge that not many are very successful at at their best. They are focused on profits and not on building relationships with their customers and contractors. Their saving grace is that Home Depot is that much worse...."
bad,"Even though Lowe's has mastered the retail home improvement store environment, it‚Äôs Out Side Sales Positions, otherwise known as PSI & PSE, have a long way to go.  Originally, these positions were more design oriented. However, at the end of 2013 a new direction has been implemented by the organization.  PSI & PSE positions are now 100 sales oriented with a hard push for closing sales."
bad,"Was a great job, but they tried to make me choose between Work and School. I chose School."
bad,when you work days you was off the clock most of the times when you was schedule but when you close for get it never know when you would get off . would have to work to 2 or 3 in morning and be back there at 5 if you was schedule no matter how far you lived . they would tell you to move to Columbus if you had a problem with it .
bad,"Let me say this starting If your young don't make a mistake and not go to school. YOU WILL REGET IT LATER. I think company are still making money but making there employes do 4x the work and they can talk to you like your nothing. I worked at 2 other lowes stores and not much negative on them really, The 3rd  store I worked at Was a joke management was trying everything to make you feel like you where nothing, Management told me speak up tell them if somebody isn't doing there share, well i did."
bad,"learned alot, friendly coworkers, management was tough though."
bad,I like this company mainly because I am a people person and I like dealing with the public
bad,This position was satisfying but the management was very unorganized and this affected the entire store personnel as well as the customers.
bad,"Apply At Own Risk!"
bad,"an ok job poor managment does not like u to work overtime overall the job is subject to teach u things "
bad,"A typical work day consists of a lot of drunk plumbers and dirty men hitting on you. "
bad,Enjoyed working at Lowe's however management was unwilling to provide me with flexible hours while I was in school and during needed medical leave. Employment with Lowe's assisted in building customer service and problem solving skills.
bad,"I truly enjoy working with the public and helping customers. I loved my job until management restructured and then it became a very stressful and emotionally exhausting experience. You could not go to lunch or simply use the restroom without constantly being penalized, with threat of termination. I am looking for a company that cares at least somewhat about the well-being of their employees and allows them to be challenged and to grow professionally. I believe hard-work, loyalty, & dedication should be rewarded. "
bad,"I was a part time front end cashier. The hours scheduled were all over the place, so you couldn't have another part time job since you had to be available all days and all open hours. Head cashiers were two faced, hung-over most days, and would stand by the door talking and laughing about their drunk nights. About the only time they talked to the cashiers was to tell them to stand up front on your spot....like a dog on a leash, and stop talking to each other. Talk about double standards. Head cashiers talk about other employees, make fun of customers on their facebook pages, and no one cares. The front end managers, well they were/are a joke. The do nothing, and no one cares. "
bad,"Good company,managment could be better hr isnt helpful or respectful besides that its a good place to work "
bad,"Do not work hard, Do not depend on your supervisor to help you, only focus on popularity with the store manager, the most incompetent store manager will destroy your career regardless if you do your job"
bad,this job has become more physical as they have asked everyone to do more with less people. They have also taken all commissions and spiffs away from all associates
bad,Current Trends:
bad,"I began work in 2005. As an 18 year old, I loved it, retail is still a high love on my list, weird right?"
bad,I worked for them for almost 5 yrs and the management team there is worthless. pleople would walk in and be able to return anything they want no matter how long they had it or if the have a receipt. If a position came up they would rather hire outside sourses and have us train them when they would be better off hiring people who knows that position.
bad,Don't expect to ever plan anything more than two weeks out. Schedule always changes and management doesn't seem to care if you have a life outside work. If you are sick they make you feel bad about calling in.
bad,I have worded at lowes for nearly a year. It was great at first till ive only been getting 19 hours a work.
bad,The store I was in was run very poorly. People were always in fear of being written up or fired. The management does not support team work at all. The pay was fair for a retail job but they don't ever want to approve any time off for vacation and if you don't use it you lose it. Be ready to have open availability and don't count on your corporate schedule. They change it at will. Unless you are desperate and want to be taken for granted don't do it.
bad,"Day to day tasks and work activities are often enjoyable and satisfying upon completion. Most co-workers are co-operative and friendly, facilitating a safe and productive work environment."
bad,"Overall, the company is still growing since its only been in the area for the past 10 years. Company is fair but relize this is not a set hour job and you are required to work some holidays,night shifts,and weekends."
bad,"I work at the store in Montgomery. Management cares little about the associates. Pay is mediocre at best and there is zero chance at overtime. Don't count on getting a set schedule, you''ll be there anytime between 4am to midnight sometimes later. Management allows the customers to treat associates as bad as they want."
bad,"Unload LTl Trucks in a safe effecient manner. Scan all merchandise, observe for damages and insure quantanties are consistent with bill of ladens and packing slips. Inventory replenishment of out of stock merchandise. Follow up with customers‚Äô orders while guaranteeing customers‚Äô satisfaction. Provide superior customer service."
bad,"I am used to real people in the construction trades-the Lowes community is built upon fear and mistrust and was a shock to my system a reality bites eye opening experience that I had completely miscomprehended from the outside looking in and leaves me disgusted now that I've been on the inside for four years, let go due to a false accussation of calling a cashier a hillbilly, and not given the opportunity to meet and discuss the truth and the cashiers incorrect point of view taken from my conversation with a customer in reference to an entirely different situation and an in general comment about living way out in the mountainsnand the cost of such delivery by distance over 20 miles"
bad,"Lowe's is a excellent company as a whole, but as usual there are cracks in the foundation. The individual store management varies from exceptional to unprofessional."
bad,Not enough direction from management team. Salary isn't enough for the labor that's required of you. The store that i am employed does not follow the lowes policy and and not treating employees fairly. I feel there is a lot of favoritism shown towards some.
bad,"I have really had some bad experiences with this company. There are NO opportunities for advancement, and the management think more about themselves."
bad,"Typically an ever changing work experience from day to day basis. One day may be very busy with special order sales, freight, covering multiple departments, and very unusual customer questions and issues that need to be resolved."
bad,My first few years were great there. It was like a little family and everyone worked together. But things changed and it became a very hostile work environment. If management didn't like you they belittled you.
bad,I worked there about 6 months and we got a new Store Manager whom came in cutting hours. They started cutting my hours down to like 10 hours weekly....I felt like it was a waste of time especially when I knew how to do everything in the store....
bad,Very difficult with the management
bad,management is a joke when i started i thought it wasa good place till people started showingthere true colors.
bad,"Work was not hard and made day go by fast. Most of the employees were helpful. Had a few department managers that seemed to talk down to their employees. management would promise you something then not follow through. Management also plays favorites, you are not rewarded for hard work but are rewarded if the store manager likes you."
bad,High turn over rate and the company has a hard time keeping their employees happy due to company changes. They move you to different departments if senior management feels you are causing any waves.
bad,Very administrative and task-focused HR job function..
bad,"I worked for Lowe's for a little over 6 years. I enjoyed the customers that would come threw our doors, I enjoyed the employees I had the pleasure to work with. I learned on this job to time manage, Multi-task and take care of all issues that arise. Customers always come first in the retail field. I enjoyed helping our customers and having them leave remembering my name and with a smile knowing I took care of them. That was most satisfying..."
bad,"Take this job at a last resort, you will come to hate your life otherwise."
bad,A lot of promises without the followup. Wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"You will fit right in on your first day at work. Along with all the other new associates. You will learn everything you need to know."
bad,"Managers aren‚Äôt very helpful and for me personally, my department manager was never around to help. They are awful on requesting time off and also with just making schedules in general. No accountability"
bad,"The company had a change in the highest levels of management and has since started to change all its process and procedures to match Home Depot. This has changed every aspect of how, where, who, and every other aspect of environment that had been designed to create a culture of inclusion of employees to work with customers on DIY projects. The culture is now being directed to bulk construction sales and all relational aspects of management to employees and employees to customers is being devolved."
bad,"Lowes used to be a great place to work.  If you could get one of the many full time jobs then you could expect good pay, and excellent benefits.  It used to be a job that you could count on.  Job stability, the chance to be promoted.  A place that allowed you to grow, learn and build positive experience.  "
bad,"Lack of structure and guidance for training.lots of false promises.Manager and assistant managers are not helpful. Constantly making changes to plan o grams ,A large disconnect with communications between associate and upper management.."
bad,"If you are lucky enough to get into a fully staffed store it‚Äôs a good place to work, but they are cutting hours and getting rid of important positions...Having to do multiple jobs and are not compensated properly"
bad,"Lowe's is a great company. Some employees are hard to get along with. Some employees make the job very easy to do. You have to be a very hard worker, a very fast learner."
bad,"Lowe's used to be about it's people, the foundation of the company. Lowe's no longer cares about it's associates. Have a President of Stores who can make a comment about Hispanics on a live broadcast and nothing was done. If that comment was made in the field, we would be termed. Just a shame of the changes in it's culture. Lowe's will probably make improvements with it's financial numbers but at the cost of many great associates and managers. Looking to replace managers( store managers and up) with tenure so don't be fooled to think you are cared about."
bad,If you want a part time job it is a fun place to work as long as you have a good manager. Its like any other job it is what you make of it. Assistant store managers are helpful. As long as your co workers do their job then you can get your down stocking done as well.
bad,"Company has changed quiet a bit in the last 5 years. Great pay and benefits. 401 and stock options are great.  Hard to understand your future with so much change year after year. Work Home balance is not good if you have family.  At senior Management level, development stops. No Support from the Market staff to store level."
bad,in  my opinion it needed a lot of tender love and care for as manager.. a high turnover for manager and employee. the store really had some good employee and assistance managers.it just wasn't professional well organize..it had some good when it came to the Holidays function's  employee getting together etc..
bad,"It was a good starting job, but there‚Äôs a lot of drug culture amongst employees and the management doesn't help new employees well  kinda just throw you to the wolves"
bad,Decent pay and work schedule work 3 days off 4 days but if no truck no work and that kills your pay but people are somewhat okay they just really go hard for job security tho....
bad,"Always shorthanded. The people who show up everyday are overworked because of the people who don't show up. Lots of chaos. Great co-workers, but not having people scheduled, in order to save money, is just too much."
bad,"I really felt I found the last job I would accept in my life, but this company is continually restructuring and reorganizing.  I was initially hired by the best Area Human Resources Business Partner, but she left to another state for another position.  Then it started to go downhill from there.  We were informed they were going to absorb the Human Resources Division and restructure it with hourly employee's and drastically downsize the number of exempt employees.  The AHRBP's became more and more punitive and looked for reasons to release you from your position to avoid paying any sort of severance when the time came.  "
bad,It was an ok company to work for way before they started letting go of people and taking away the department manger positions after that management and everything started going down hill
bad,Overall this is a good job but only for full timers. I went from working 24-28 hours every week to not working at all in a week. They also require full weekend availability.
bad,You will make better money but should always remember your just a number to the company that's why your given a number to clock in with. Most associates hate there job.
bad,"While there is much to learn, which makes working in this type of retail so much more interesting than folding a sweater or hanging a shirt in a department store, the general appreciation for the type of person willing to expand, adapt, and learn has been on a general decline by the company.  Not all people are suited for Lowes.  There is so much to know and often little time to learn it.  But it is one of the things that keep the day worthwhile.  Still, having people who can cut glass and design projects should be paid more than those who are not willing to learn any of that.  They should be treated better.  Lowes is chipping away at that appreciation and compensation."
bad,Not good or bad. Supervisors and managers weren‚Äôt very knowledgeable and frequently told customers that they didn‚Äôt know where merchandise was in store.
bad,Hated working for this company! The corporate culture is awful and management too. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. They lie to their employees.
bad,This company has changed and not for the better. It has made it increasingly difficult to hold onto good people and maintain a positive attitude at work.
bad,"Poor work culture and management. No work-life balance and poor salary/wage for work being done. Employee appreciation is zero. On the other hand, a good learning experience"
bad,I was the back-end supervisor for one of the stores got two days training to run 5 areas. Staffing was the worst had four people to unload and stock freight. Management just plain bad never had people to cover areas for hours. I wouldnt recommend this job or company to anyone. By for the worst job of my life.
bad,No real since of family... pushed hard to make sales... never enough help to wait on customers... Hard to balance family/work life... hard to get time off when needed.
bad,"I like it just want full time, the managers are somewhat ok "
bad,We got a new store manager and things started to change. They got rid of a lot of people and started only hiring for part-time positions. They had a new system input schedules and that left a lot of gaps. Barely had coverage for the front.
bad,"I did my best to make the department look good and also was very customer motivated. I loved helping people. The management never made anything better and more of what they were supposed to do started falling on me. The big thing was I never could have a social life due to the crazy work hours. For example this would be my work week. Monday 6am-2pm, Tuesday off, Wednesday 10am-7pm, Thursday 8am-5pm,Friday off, Saturday 2pm-11pm, Sunday 1pm-9pm. Yea like I said they made it hard to actually enjoy working there."
bad,If you think they are supporting you they are not! Its all about what the store makes!! You have to be 100% available  and live for the job.  If this company would realize how much money they spend in training staff. Once trained employees are an asset!  Managers treated staff horribly always reminding you that you are replaceable.. and 0 support when you hold key positions.
bad,I Do not recommended anyone working for Lowe‚Äôs. Looking else were. Not happy with what the company has became in past couple of years! The new CEO has no respect for family values!
bad,"Changes do not have employee in mind, there really isn't much more to say than what I already said. Not sure what you want me say, all about the customers and management, but if you want happy customers you should have happy employees"
bad,"unable to budget money, as hours vary wildly from week to week.  Terribly understaffed, management gives you 10 different lists of things to do, all while putting customers first, then berating employees for not having 8 arms to do it all. It's a busy, fast paced store, but one person running all of 2 entire departments cannot possible wait on customers, put away stock on upper shelves, straighten out the existing misplaced stock, etc.  The stress is high and the only attitude from management is to demand more.  The customers get highly aggravated when  someone from another department cannot answer technical questions because of staffing shortage. Staff morale is very low."
bad,"Not the best environment, and very unprofessional culture. Able to learn skills to move forth with in other jobs but not ideal for me. Too many favourites."
bad,2 stars would recommend. That's it nothing more to add. Don't know why you ask for more. Worked hard. moved on. Job is good for elderly and college students.
bad,When I started People were generally happy including long time associates. Since the new ceo took over jobs have been cut with no notice. Other changes have resulted in very stressful work atmosphere. Formerly happy specialists are jumping ship
bad,If you havent been there for a year dont expect support for maternity leave and dr appointments. Will not give you days off for the appoinments unless you have been there for a year otherwise you will be using entire vacation time for appointments
bad,Giving SMART Customer service. Constant learning of product knowledge on my on accord. Helping Lowe's thrive on sales  budget to plan. Being a Department Manager in the past gives you the experience and know how of what management of Lowe's should and can be. The Lowe's store I work at is a training store for new store managers. In the 7 yrs I have been at this store I have had 4 different store managers. The 1st was given a prosition and moved on. 2nd and 3rd were fired. The one now has the store in such a hostile environment that assistant managers have resigned. Department Manager's  have been fired or stepped down to  protect their. The most enjoyable  aspect of my job is helping customers  love where they live.
bad,I was never allowed to get anymore training than the bare minimum required to be a cashier. Training that I did receive was different with every cashier.
bad,"Always understaffed, great stock company, lack of marketing or specials, customer traffic is great during holidays otherwise slow days at work are expected."
bad,"I worked as a PSE for Lowe‚Äôs for a fair amount of time. There is zero training that your given, so you just thrown in to a burning pit. Store Management has zero understanding of my position and would throw you under the bus to make themselves look good to a customer. Pay was pretty good during Summer/Spring. Winter you‚Äôd be lucky to get a commission check. Store is suppose to drive leads for the program but they don‚Äôt and Store management doesn‚Äôt help, but if you don‚Äôt sell anything you are the one in trouble. Very stressful job, the company has a process that is supposed to help and move jobs through, but it is very flawed. You spend more time dealing with upset customers and people who don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on or how things are installed then you do selling. Your personal reputation will take more hits than Lowe‚Äôs as a company will and they will make sure of that. They care more about Wall Street than their employees. No loyalty to the employees. Very stressful job with people who don‚Äôt care about you."
bad,‚ÄúThe Lowe‚Äôs of the Future‚Äù company campaign is to cut wages and reduce staffing to increase customer service. How does that even make sense? They are management heavy at the regional and corporate level and have no experienced staff at the customer service level. A business model that will promote more sales for Amazon.com.
bad,"I made almost $3 more than I did at my previous job."
bad,"Early in my career .  Lots of back stabbing  from insecure people .  Wouldnt do it again.  I was the supervisor and I enjoyed the people that worked under me , but , the negatives out weighed the positive  and I resigned for a better opportunity ."
bad,"Even though I'm giving Lowe's a low score, I""m thankful for the opportunity of working there as a first time job and work experience it has given me that I'll use in future jobs."
bad,"They do not enforce rules. It takes stealing or fighting to get fired. Other than that anything goes. Customer service is lacking very few associates care because management doesn't  care. No set schedules . Some times days, afternoon's, evening's schedules jump around., very inconsistant"
bad,"It‚Äôs not worth working there and they treat you like trash  after your there for a little while. They preach that there a family and they care about there employees but they don‚Äôt , they‚Äôll use you and make you work late and make you feel like you don‚Äôt have a choice and that it‚Äôs all about them and no one else !!!!! Don‚Äôt work there and it‚Äôs a big big big headache"
bad,"Management will only work with you if it benefits them. Employees otherwise are like family. I did learn a lot about customer service, through struggles with this company it has made me a loyal worker."
bad,lowes was good until the new ceo took over. managers get carried away with their power and they are disrespectful to employees. im looking to work for a better company
bad,"Was the telephone operator at service desk. Forced to learn to do returns even though I had a physical disability."
bad,"Managers here are terrible at communication, especially with their subordinates. Employees being made to switch departments with no real choice, never being listened to when they want to switch departments despite the store manager's insistence that they want employees to be happy, never being listened to about hours, availability, or really most other concerns. Late punches are barely ever fixed unless badgered, employee health issues are ignored unless you threaten them, at least one employee has said that their hours were cut drastically ""coincidentally"" after being injured."
bad,"I started working at Lowe‚Äôs immediately after they closed the company I was currently working for. "
bad,"Horrible. The location in Framingham is anyway. The new CEO has ruined a lot for this company as well. Waste of 6 months for me. Tied with Target in Framingham (right next door)  for the worst management and worst ""team"" effort and that says quite a lot! I would never recommend the Framingham location but would possibly recommend another one."
bad,"Working for Lowe's for 10 plus years,  I learned a lot enjoyed  the work experience and atmosphere until alot changes  by are new CEO from downsizing personal and benefits."
bad,"Was getting paid $11.75 an hour for seasonal work which I thought was great pay but the managers don't communicate and you get in trouble for it and as far as scheduling goes it's all over the place. Some days I'd work 2 hours and some days they have me work 8, it was always different. I didn't receive any paid time off because I was a seasonal employee, so when I had an emergency surgery  it was an issue for them. Also I had a death in the family and they didn't want to give me time off for the funeral."
bad,"The job itself is not difficult and pay is really good for part time. PT also gets vacation and holiday and insurance but the insurance is awful. "
bad,"While it was rather easy to get a job at Lowe's, the current state of the company made the work experience less than enjoyable. There was little positive support from management and almost no chance for advancement due to positions being eliminated."
bad,I worked as the outside salesmen selling exterior projects for the company. It was fun when there were plenty of leads.  Not so much fun when the store did not have the foot traffic to be able to generate leads.
bad,May start out with good hours but after sesonal luck to get 10 a week. Hard to get someone to help if you need something and you have to push to sign people up for credit cards and extended warranties
bad,"I worked seasonally here and got out as quickly as I could. At first, I was hopeful about being hired on and building a career within the company, because I do honestly hear good things about the company."
bad,Managers Tend To Single You Out If They Dislike You And Refuse To Promote You. Some Store Policies Are Pushed While Others Are Ignored Ignores Concerns You Might Have
bad,With the new CEO there are many changes being made. Some may work in the long run however the day to day is a struggle to keep up with the new demands. They are working on getting more employees in to help but it will take time and training to reach the goals the company is trying to reach.
bad,"I would characterize Lowe's as a good place to learn, but not to make a career. I learned a lot, and met awesome people, work mates and customers. It's definitely a place where you have to roll with the punches!  I did leave there knowing more then when I started. So, can't say it was all bad."
bad,You have to be there favorite to be able to work peace if not they be on your butt management and coaches they have there are the worst they could get
bad,"When I first started at Lowe‚Äôs, I loved it. I loved the people I worked with as well as my customers. However, after a year of being there I was still part time and I wanted a full time position but I didn‚Äôt have any luck. I couldn‚Äôt pay my bills, couldn‚Äôt help my mom out if she needed it whereas other people who had either been there after I started or people who just walked in off the street and were given a full time position. It wasn‚Äôt fair to me at all. Let‚Äôs not forget with how I was being treated by employees and my store manager with being threatened and finger pointing involved and my own store manager talking to me rudely and in a condescending manner. I will NEVER work for Lowe‚Äôs ever again."
bad,"I worked in recieving and stocking positions are fun but promote the ""you against the rest of the store"" mentality especially when managers do things like throw parties and by the time you come in your left with cold leftover scraps. Overall toxic environment but you become close to people on your team."
bad,A Great place to work..Full time opportunities are there as well as part time or department change.  Management will work with you to excel in your position.High energy is required in this fast paced retail operation. This is not a Monday -Friday business.
bad,"-Poor training in most positions"
bad,"not the worst place to work, but it could definitely be improved with a company focus on the employees rather than the shareholders. The moral is almost nonexistent."
bad,"Management only cares about store appearance  , not relationship with customers satisfaction and the repoir you have with them. Do not live up to the culture they teach."
bad,"Make sure you always take good notes and follow up with everything.  Several teams have great culture and are great to work for, while others are not."
bad,"Though the pay is great for the area, the job culture is seriously flawed. The employees are overworked and underappreciated, with consistent mandatory overtime throughout the year and thanks given in the form of write ups and performance plans."
bad,"Other locations may have a different experience.  Corporate will call and say someone needs to be let go that day if sales are down. Without notice you are let go even if your performance was great. But, Lowe's request a employee give 2 week notice before leaving. Store manager did not notice or overlooked several things that should not have went on. Pro services were giveing special discounts to certain construction companies. Cashiers disciplined for not giving the discount even though there was not a list of the particular company's and the cashiers float from one department to another. Different standards for different employees. 2 employees could do the same thing and only 1 would be disciplined. Long time employees were not given a chance to advance."
bad,"I didn‚Äôt hate it at first but it just slowly gets worse, you just notice more things that aren‚Äôt right as time goes on especially for them supposedly being a family company they never give you time for family. They have a rotating schedule so you hardly ever get weekends off. They don‚Äôt approve days off very often so it‚Äôs hard to plan or have a life and you only get Christmas off all other holidays you work"
bad,"Heavy customer service, customer sometimes short - but you work past that to help meet their needs, and the store goals, store culture set by store manager, busy days, not a lot of opportunity to learn new skills - no in house training,"
bad,"Poor Management. Always felt as if under a microscope. If I had important questions regarding personnel issue, Direct report Manager would run away, stating busy (at all times), then talk down to you. H.R. told to just keep. Just Frustrating"
bad,"I actually did mind my job at Lowe‚Äôs as a stocker and would still be there if they had another night manager. The manager I had on the night shift would not help us at all even when we were short. He never emerged until about 3:45 or 4:00 every morning. By then we would be finished. But when it was time to get off all of a sudden he would find 100 things to do and we could not leave until it was all done. Normally this would not be a problem had he been out on the work floor in the first place and these things could have got done on time instead of having to stay over. The night manager was very unprofessional and very defensive if you asked about anything. This was because he wasn‚Äôt doing his job and didn‚Äôt want to be called out on it. He basically got paid for just showing up to work because again - he was NEVER around.He had no work ethic at all other then just showing up for work.  When the other managers filled in for him - it was just the opposite. They would help us and made sure everything was done on time. They were way more disciplined and cared more about the workers and the store and were respected by everyone. Other then that it was not a bad job or company to work for. Unfortunately, one bad apple can spoiled the whole barrel. The bad apple on night shift just happened to be the manager. That‚Äôs why they have such a huge turnover rate among the stockers out there"
bad,"I first started working there 2 years ago, it was quite an enjoyable place to work. Pleasant work enviornment, good management, employees that were willing work together. It felt very welcoming to be at. Sadly things have changed. The ASMs are terrible except for one or two of them, but the rest just bark unreasonable demands at the employees. Every area of the store is now shorthanded, especially the front end. Often times there will be only one cashier and management expects them to do everything on their own with no help. There are even times where there is nobody in a department at all to help any of the customers. Management has been purposely short staffing the entire store to the point where the employees can no longer do their job efficiently. Nobody stays working here longer than a month or two. Sometimes even less now.¬† This causes much more stress on the employees and nobody wants to help each other now because they are forced to handle a ridiculous amount of work by themselves at once now. ASMs even threaten to write employees up for not fufilling their unreasonable demands instead coming to help them. Worst part of the store is the service desk. Almost every day there is only ONE PERSON at the service desk for most of the day, and we get customer complaints about it every single day. Management still refuses to do anything about it"
bad,It‚Äôs an alright job but not up to my standards because they don‚Äôt pay me how I want and they don‚Äôt always have they stuff together like they supposed to
bad,"Decisions are made by corporate and upper management seemingly with no knowledge of how the stores really work. It‚Äôs like going to a clown circus but there‚Äôs no make up, or music, just all the nonsense"
bad,"Working at Lowe's is not for me, but it was available and worked out well enough.  I would only recommend working here if you have the capacity and motivation to deal with the eccentricities."
bad,Regardless of performance there were no bonus or incentive plans. Little to no advancement possible. In store software was very old with very little training provided.
bad,The worst part of working at Lowe's is the poor management.  They do not treat employees well at all.  They expect a lot and do not offer any assistance to get the job done.  Not only does this affect the employees but it affects the customers and creates a negative/poor shopping experience.
bad,"I worked my way up while I was there, but I saw a lot of good employees leave, including myself.  Pooler Lowe‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought.  Much better at customer service than Statesboro Lowe‚Äôs.  Customer Service does not exist at the Statesboro Lowe‚Äôs."
bad,"Too much merchandising and instore stock movement resulting in poor inventory management."
bad,worked for lowes almost 10 years and kept getting put off for reviews and promotions and was passed up for someone out side the company and then had to help in training that person. I was on interment leave was told by my Dr everything should be good kept having problem only missed 3 day and was let go bc of missing those days.
bad,No orders pull for delivering sometime 6 to 13 orders need to be pulled none done spend the early day pulling order made the orders for the late worked longer hours.
bad,Poor management and hostile work place. They do not follow ADA laws. The management has no place at his and her job. Most other employees don't like their jobs.
bad,Cool place to work to exercise your talents. Compensation could be better. The incentive program needs a complete overhaul. Would love to see more training and growth promoted.
bad,"Had some of the most difficult times working at this place, as it offered very little in terms of financial security. The management was difficult to find even footing with and only few company staff actually cared about the job."
bad,"You can be up on all of your work and still it's never done. The people on 3rd shift that upstock have no training. Spend all day arranging stock they come in and they just put product ""wherever"". Very aggravating. Not enough coverage to help customers. Some covering 2-3 dept. at a time and no appreciation from manager."
bad,"Store management is usually pretty good. Corporate is another matter. They're dumping Human Resources in the stores for a ""phone or online"" system. So, if you need someone quickly, best of luck. The culture up until last summer was putting the customer first. Prices are a little higher than elsewhere, but the customers were treated well. The new CEO changed all that to make it about return for the stockholders. So stores closed and anything ""extra"" like customer service or new employee training suffered. Pay is acceptable, but don't expect to be given training. You'll be thrown out onto the floor and expected to learn on your own. The corporate teams give lip service to training and creating a good work environment, but that's all it is. Managers are overworked, so a lot of things slip through the cracks, especially since they're now expected to do HR as well. Advancement is possible, if you're willing to move to another store. Lowe's used to offer cook outs and some food freebies, but I think that's gone now too unless that managers want to chip in. In short, this place is becoming just another retailer out to make a buck first instead of caring for customers and employees. If you can work in that kind of job, go for it. Scheduling is a real issue also. You're supposed to know your schedule 3 weeks in advance, but you never will. It can change over night without warning."
bad,"worst job ever. Loved many of my co-workers but management does not know how to speak to anyone and they dont look out for their workers. Yoy are expected to let customers treat you like dirt, don't stand up for yourself, and give every customer a huge discount for being a brat."
bad,"Not the best place to work but it‚Äôs a good job for someone In college or someone who is willing to say yes to everything without a complaint, management is alright but safety is at least a priority."
bad,"Lowe's is a company in a downward spiral! They have implemented a lot of new corporate policies as a ""knee jerk"" reaction, to put a Band-Aid  on larger more gaping problems! We are always greatly understaffed, but they expect a skeleton crew to take up the slack and perform at a fully staffed level. We are often expected to cover multiple departments, not just the one we were hired to maintain! NO OVERTIME, is always preached, but yet we don't have the time in a normal work day to keep stock off the floor and maintain our departments to where they don't look like a war zone. Some lower level managers are good, but upper management in our store seems to be clueless. Very physically demanding job!! Pay is subpar, in my opinion! NOT a great place to work at present! ....""Old Timers"" that have been there for years, say the company started in decline when they eliminated the department managers positions. Lowe's seems unable to admit this mistake and reinstate this viral role!"
bad,Unorganized. Will work you dry.. I wad there for 6 months promised to be on a machine within my 90 days have yetbto ride one after being certified for 5 months.
bad,Lowes is a poor ran company that does not care about its people at all . That all I want to say about how bad this place is . I wish I could have left the company years ago
bad,Good pay but mostly because they will work you til you cant move and you make dumb amounts of overtime and they only give you one weekend off a month.
bad,"Can be a fast pace environment. If you work as a sales associate, it can be difficult to juggle your work life and home life. You can learn different ways to maintain your house."
bad,Do what you are told. No room for the management to do the right thing. The company needs entry level people or retired people that are bodys not any one that they would actually have to talk too.
bad,"lack of management, no effort to help fellow employees, employees were watched and not trusted by management, high turn-over, no training program, lots of unhappy employees"
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. You'll start out seasonal which means they can fire you at any point, you don't get benefits, bad pay, horrible scheduling, they won't let you hit 40 hours a week, and you're pretty much expendable so they'll have you do things that isn't even your job to do."
bad,large work environment with little retail employees always short staff creating a difficult time to provide good customer service. Management also needs improvement in caring for their workers.
bad,Poor management every stressful don‚Äôt work as a team not  team members  left all the time  but if I wasn‚Äôt for team  member it would go work place to work they don‚Äôt take a lot of authority there kind is do what you want
bad,Been working here for a while and  up until recently everything went down hill. Half the managers don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. Majority of the employees are lazy so that leaves a lot of stress and pressure on the people that actually knew what they were doing. It was a nice place to work for at first
bad,"one of the first things taught at our store is the Store Director does NOT take phone calls, customer questions or complaints. Unless caller/customer asks specifically for that manager..he is NOT to be disturbed for any reason. If situation arised where employee had no other manager to refer to- be assured heads were going to roll. Most employees happy with pay, benefits, and job duties around the store- except the service desk. Nobody wanted any part of THAT area. Once trained at service, very difficult to transfer out- unless more poor, unsuspecting new hires take over."
bad,The pay is good but when it comes to management they do not know what they are doing.when you worked for other company's where a spouse can't work in the same store or shift as you are. They had that their where husband is coach and the wife was the person that inputs all your off standard time she would go out her way to make sure talk to with him about his employees that working for him in his department to see if he would change the time or not enter it in at all. That's one thing it is that expect you to get 100 everyday that you on but said if you get 90 or better is good but get on to you when you fall short of 100 in performance.
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of taking phone calls that would come from either customers inquiring about their lowes delivery status why is late, wanting to file a complaint about their delivery or from store employees wanting to update their delivery schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was coworkers"
bad,"The people their where nice and the management team where great; although, they wasted a lot of time, and could not schedule properly. The work was fine, and i could have stayed a long time. I was a good employee. they just would not give me hours. So I left, their loss."
bad,"They pay a little more than their competitors, but give you 3x as much responsibility. Management doesn't communicate with each other or address employee concerns. They hire you for a specific department but use you as a floater throughout the warehouse."
bad,"You could never count on your hours. Additionally, they would make anyone a manager. And there was always a competition amongst the managers.  It was a tightrope.   Once, the store manager called me in to ask my opinion of what was going on.  I told him.  When my manager heard that I told him the truth, it suddenly cost me a weeks worth of hours.  My hours never returned to normal after that, which is why I left."
bad,"Over the last several years corporate is constantly changing the management structure with taking away positions then re-inserting them as different titles, thus makes creating a long lasting team near impossible."
bad,At one point the entire upper management quit inside of a week. Nobody ever wanted to be there. The pay was good though. You also never got a consistent schedule.
bad,"The job itself, great. Decent hours with room for overtime, nice pay. Sounds great. Until you start without any training, lazy coworkers, and rude/irresponsible management. I've worked here over a month, have yet to meet the store manager. And I don't have a steady job. Meaning, I get to work and have many projects thrown at me from all different managers with absolutely no guidence. Then get yelled at for being a slacker and not working when all project are not complete. Having managers/other employees not doing their jobs, and telling you to pick up the slack. Also, have managers talk bad about you to others... So childish. Very high turnover over rate at my store for these very reasons."
bad,"I work for Lowes in the delivery department, I deliver appliances such as refrigerators, ranges, washers, dryers and other items from the store, flooring, grills"
bad,terrible pay and terrible management. you also have to do your job as well as the sales assoicates job bcause they are too lazy too. thats why i leeft
bad,"Stressful environment, under-staffed and over-worked. Low employee morale. Sometimes treated like robots. Poor management. Requested days off are denied for some, approved for others."
bad,"Lack of communication between shifts and management. Changes were often made without the information being passed down to team members. I found it very frustrating. Politics also played a big part in advancement, which I think passed over some very qualified people for management positions"
bad,"I just recently left. I loved my coworkers and leaving was hard, but they would not let me move up. I ran the service desk better than anyone else (what I was told by management), but they refused to let me get full time. I was told to wait that it would happen for 3 years. The new CEO sucks. He‚Äôs firing full timers and making the whole company part time. There‚Äôs no staffing. No help. The management is stressed out due to lack of help. The company is going down hill. I don‚Äôt recommend it until some things are changed."
bad,Favorites got away with anything . Work your butt off while fellow Dept associates don‚Äôt work and still get overlooked and treated badly. This used to be a good enviornment now it is simply saddening
bad,"The store that I started off at was a good store. The managers actually helped their employees, and were actually MANAGERS. The store that I tranfered to was a whole different story. The employee morale absolutely sucks. Management sucks even more. There were so many times where there were no employees scheduled in the lumber department (where I cashiered) and I needed someone to help a customer at the lumber saw. When I would call a manager to assist the customer, all they would do is page overhead for another employee to help. Mind you this was right after I did the same axact thing. There were also many times where I needed a manager override, and I had to page many times in order for a manager to finally come help. Need a code 3 or a code 50? Good luck with that!! Too many times I needed another cashier to come help me get the line down, and I would get no response due to lack of coverage. And no, the managers wouldn't come help either.  Most of the department supervisors had an ego the size of Texas. The only thing that was good about Lowe's was the pay was above average, as far as retail. I did make some good friends there that I will keep in contact with. Still, I would never work for them again."
bad,I would prefer to not talk about my experiences working at Lowe's. There is absolutely nothing good to say about my time working there and would prefer to not share those details.
bad,"you could spend your day cleaning your department and come back to a mess everyday. our manager at the time was trying to get manager of the year so our standers were really high, but corporate cut all hours so it was hard to balance everything"
bad,The job is very easy. However they are overly specific on how injury occurs. They also don't have enough breaks for the amount the body goes through working there.
bad,"The management team in lacking and unhelpful, you rarely if ever get s concrete answer from them and they often refuse to work with you on scheduling."
bad,Can be a fun place to work at but other times very stressful especially during the summertime. Management at times can be very poor too and lack of communication
bad,"Everyday is a different experience with high Customer count,service expectations and high tickets item sales. the learning experience is that the more trained you are the more Customers will have the confidence to make significant investment purchases. a challenge is training fellow workers not comfortable or not willing with areas not accustomed to their work experience, it is enjoyable to see Customers expectations fulfilled and see Them as return Customers."
bad,"I have been in executive management most of my career and have a very good understanding of how the management side of a business operates.  I have never said an ill word about any of the companies I worked far, but it is sad to see what was a quality operation go bad."
bad,"The things that bothers me about working at Lowe's is the general negative attitude of most of the staff members and managers. There is a lot of drama among full grown adults which was honestly kind of annoying, and definitely a downer at work. Management, and scheduling was extremely poor. Sometimes you'd only work four hours one day a week and sometimes you had to work long shifts for a week straight."
bad,"Over all not a place I recommend to work. I‚Äôve been there 3 years and when I first started it was awesome. I‚Äôve been at my wits end with this place for the better part of a year now, managers constantly sit in their office and do nothing while you drown. You can call and ask for help and IF they answer their phone at all it‚Äôll just be to tell you they are busy. There are exceptions of course but the managers you‚Äôll be dealing with(your chain of command) will always leave you hanging. When they do come out of their office it‚Äôll only be to yell at you to break it up if there‚Äôs more than one person in a vest together, or if there is a red light flashing on selfcheck. Regardless of how busy you are. They have no clue and it doesn‚Äôt matter to them. You‚Äôll also be given projects that belong to other departments or if there‚Äôs ANYTHING in the store that needs doing that they deem anyone else too busy to do, it becomes the problem of the front end. My experience there got so bad that other managers noticed an ASM  singling me out, even said they noticed it, and did absolutely nothing to step in or say something to anyone higher up. If you‚Äôre just stopping through for the summer it probably won‚Äôt be too bad for you, but trust me I‚Äôm a hard worker and have worked 2+ jobs for 4 years straight and this place really blows. Not worth the stress at all."
bad,"This company has a severe lack of respect for store level associates. Many are mistreated by in house management teams and then dismissed by corporate HR (there no longer is any store HR as the company has decided they are unnecessary). Services and products consumers rely on and trust are constantly being removed and not replaced leaving associates in the firing line of upset customers. Management is very good at pencil bending, pretending to be busy and never around to help when needed. In short, if you are alright with a stressful job and absolutely no consistency in hours for a decent pay, then this might be the job for you."
bad,Horrible management at my store. New Managers would not accommodate my working schedule even though I had the same schedule for 2 years. Comradery was great among employees. Would not recommended working at the store in Goldsboro NC.
bad,"Lowes was okay in the beginning. However, as with a lot of companies, at Lowes they don't really want to hear complaints from a  subordinate about a manger. Oh yes the sing and dance the tone of open door policy and maintaining a healthy fruitful work environment.However, its all talk. If you have a manager that talks to in a rude and unprofessional matter, they may call that person in a say ""naughty manger"" but that's it. There will be no repercussions for that person. the only time that unprofessional and rude behavior is handled with any type of repercussions is when its directed at a customer (as should be the case). However, when it comes to a manager to subordinate, they could care less."
bad,"Clean. Only 1 bathroom. Highest theft score in the nation. None of the managers coordinate with eachother, and the ladder is impossible to climb. Good for high school kids"
bad,lowe's is cool if your just looking for another way to make money on the side for the most part they don't ask much of you and its a typical 9 hour shift with an hour lunch
bad,management is not consistent in direction and daily duties in level of performance change from manager to manager.You need to be flexible and be ready for change.
bad,Must be a groupie. They don't like to rehire former employees. I have applied 6 times and get rejected letters for each time. And no legitimate reason for the rejection.
bad,"I found that management in that location does not communicate to one another . I also found myself baffled as to how did some of them acquire their positions as managers when they couldn't do some of the simplest tasks. a for example is my supervisor couldn't ring me out for some septic cleaner and give me my discount because, he didn't know how, although he was supposed to."
bad,Job is very political and requires you to go up one step at a time regardless of work or college experience. Management is non-existent and the benefits are so expensive you have to get outside insurance or you can't afford to work there.
bad,"Great store, but most employees are not given the training needed to do their jobs effectively. Managers are stretched so thin that you can see how stressed out they are all the time. People that actually care about their job and work hard are given a hard time, where as people who don't care are treated like Angel's. Don't make waves or express you opinion. They will find a way to get rid of you."
bad,The CEO reorg'd. at least once per year indicating he didn't know how to select quality people.He also didn't hold his direct reports accountable. Very few Leaders at this company from mid to executive management.
bad,Difficult hours due to position. Often requiring long work days and an unfavorable work life balance and stressful work environment. Most annual reviews did not provide opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Assess client needs and provide services in assigned service area including but not limited to educational pursuits, employability, securing employment, financial management, housing procurement, transportation, information and referral, and advocacy. 2. Maintain accurate and up-to-date case files with required documentation. 3. Collect statistical data and submit required reports on a monthly and quarterly basis."
bad,For a retirement part time job it is difficulty to work nights and days in same week. I would not do it put on any given day there was an associate who got off at 11:pm and had to be back at 5:am the next morning.
bad,I am glad I am not there anymore!!!  Nights and weekends are required and you have to be available. Unfair in compensation. Unfair in promotions which are limited. Dog eat dog environment.
bad,"They will find reasons to run you off or fire you. They have a large turnover that needs to be looked out by their CEO and department of labor . "
bad,"Most of the people I worked with were good people. Some managers good, some bad. At times, could be difficult to effectively do your job. It would be very helpful if scheduling alowed extra coverage. At times too many chiefs, not enough indians."
bad,This company was at one time a great place to work. During the recent changes the local area team has made you feel more like a number and care less if you are a hard worker who shows up. They only look at things in a black and white manner. There is no room for mistakes. Either you follow the rules perfectly with no mistakes or you are gone.
bad,"Long days walking and talking to customers.  Learned product knowledge was a plus to help customers find the right items for what they were doing as a project."
bad,"I would not recommend this place located in Clermont, Florida it has poor management, if you get injured they ignore the sitution, poor HR, poor hours"
bad,"The Newark Lowes is terrible to work for. I really didn't enjoy working here.  There was little training, the management was terrible about working with a schedule."
bad,"Management is somthing to be desired, but the co worker's are definatly permanent family members who are helpful and are willing to teach you what you need, you will definitely learn alot from this job"
bad,"Managment has no idea what to do or when to do it. There is a tangible fear of corporate looming over every action."
bad,"Poorly managed and ran distribution center. The working conditions were awful, cramped and you were forced to clock in/out precisely on the minute. no early punches...but you were expected to be onsite at least 10-15 minutes early."
bad,"Too long of hours to be hot in the summer. If its 90 outside, its 120 on the inside and working on hot equipment is torment. Too hot for any human, Take too long to pick the shift of choice."
bad,Would have say not place that I prefer to work and sometimes avoid to shop. Feel that staff is not as helpful/friendly. Workers do bare minimum and working hard I don't think it is required there.
bad,"The management is a joke. The environment between coworkers is toxic, and only made worse because there is nonin syore HR any more. The term ""too many hens in the henhouse"" comes to mind. "
bad,"Not a good company. I was paid 11.17 as a full time lumber associate to use and operate heavy machinery equipment. constantly cutting wood for customers and handling pieces of lumber weighing over 100lbs. Think about it. You have to drive a high-low around with a bundle of 16ft pieces of lumber through a narrow store 20ft above your head, and yet they pay head cashiers 14-15 to deal with money, and sit on their phones its truly unbelievable. Management was an absolute joke, acting like they had the BIGGEST most serious job in the world its like you work at LOWES get real. Store meetings was a bunch of complaining about how everything wasn't good enough and how everyone needed to work harder."
bad,"It is an okay place to work does have good benefits for full-time or part-time benefits stink"
bad,"If you've never had a job and are in need of work, this is a good place to start. "
bad,Not a place I would recommend. Management doesn't seem to lead. There are too many friends and not enough workers. There never seems to be a plan of action.
bad,I work as a freight flow associate. It was a great job for 3 years. Then they forced us to go to overnite freight and the problems began. Too few workers expected to perform miracles and a schedule that was in a constant state of flux. Started off with 2 days off in a row while working 8 hour shifts. Then it changed to 10 hour shifts and days off were split up. Then with no notice it went back to 8 hour days and days off still split. We were told our schedule could change at anytime and was only good for a month at a time with hours and days off. No way to plan anything with family without using vacation days and if someone else was already off your request was denied. New employees would last just a few nites and it would take a month to replace them. In the mean time you were still expected to do the work of 7 with only 4. I am so tired on my days off I can barely function. Shift is not a true overnite shift. It runs from 7pm to 4am. But we are regularly required to stay till almost 5 to finish freight. I can now leave at lunch but not many places are open after 11. Use to be we could not leave for lunch but were not paid for it either. Have tried to get a position during the day time but have been told I am to valuable to the over nite crew to come to days.
bad,To strict about shoplifting policys. Wouldn't promote me to full time status but worked full time hours. I liked my job. And customers but not happy about strict polices.
bad,it's a lay back work place. it will be a great work place if they hired and pay the people that actually work what they deserved. work flow and employees are great but they just don't have the aditional help they need most of the time.
bad,My store management sucked.  You could bust butt all day and still not been seen as working hard enough.  They also did not seem to want to push anyone towards advancement.  The outdoor lawn and garden was also a heatstroke waiting to happen.
bad,Started off as a seasonal cashier and worked myself to a part-time cashier.  Now doing scanning with promises of training in the cash office and head cashier with no training started at all. Suppose to be training on pricing three weeks ago and still haven‚Äôt started that yet
bad,"No opportunity for advancement,  very buddy buddy with who they promote and who they don‚Äôt. Pretty much the good ole boy system if you weren‚Äôt friends with all the managers then you weren‚Äôt getting a promotion."
bad,"The program is old and each market, let alone store does it‚Äôs own thing. I loved designing for my customers but overall I left feeling like it was just a sales job (and just SALES, SALES, SALES).  Other specialists /management is always looking at you like you‚Äôre not doing anything and that you don‚Äôt know anything and why you are never coverage, which you are not coverage, but somehow people always expect it (looked at like you are not a team player). Also, not having an office (if you have one, congrats, but my store did not).  Plus they weren‚Äôt willing to spruce up old kitchen layouts with discontinued doors, color, finish, glass etc! What a joke! So we would say, sorry we don‚Äôt have that... or that... or that... reality is that Lowes does not want to put in the money, let alone the VERY OLD IT systems they have, which you have to learn SO Many oldand slow programs to do one project. It was overall very frustrating and management doesn‚Äôt care because your manager is a market manager somewhere else. You are alone at your store with a bit of help but not enough to get quick answers. This program needs work. If you are an Interior Designer, do not do retail! If you have to, hey I get it, learn what you can and move on. Note on pay:  expect a LOW base pay and small commissions that come about 4-5 weeks later. Other than that your base is not enough to get by.  Note: working with others, you have to kiss butt to have people work with you, they remove commission from kitchen and appliance specialists and they are ****hurt about it. relationship skills are really needed."
bad,Home improvement retail is not much different than other retail.  Shifts vary from early AM to late night.  Training is limited to come computer training and then being thrown into the fire.
bad,Because of the last restructure Lowe's has really changed. There is no guidance and direction in departments now. Coverage is worse than its ever been. People leaving left and right. Customers frustrated because all the knowledgeable and experienced employees was left go or left on their own. Lack of help from employees. The morale is terrible.
bad,"If you're a student/youngster who wants a better gig than restaurant/fast food, the pay is OK. If you're management level or a sales ""specialist,"" you might like Lowe's. If you're an HR person, you might love Lowe's, because the HR woman at my store was the laziest person I'd ever met. Rarely answered her phone and was non-responsive to numerous complaints lodged by numerous employees about numerous problems/conflicts, including inappropriate behavior and speech. She did spend lots of time decorating bulletin boards like a kindergarten teacher.  "
bad,"My day at Lowe's would start at 5/6 AM every day. I would print out my delivery manifest and survey the route I'd be taking as the first (or second) truck out. I would create my route, pull my appliances, and then place them in order of delivery. "
bad,"fasted passed, usually work an isle on own.Then move on to next until all pallets are done. need to know where product goes. work anywhere from 3 to 6 hrs."
bad,"Lowes in general is an average retail job with long hours, no paid lunch, and average to poor management. The biggest problem for new employees is the lack of training, as you get about 2 hours of computer training and then get dropped into the department alone. Normally this is where a department manager would come in and help, but they abandoned that management style about a year ago. Now the managers are very separated from their departments and provide minimal support."
bad,"Clocked in, grabbed water to stay dehydrated. Got my supplies for work out my locker. Got put in a lot of areas picking up boxes. They had a cafeteria."
bad,Lowes has a super high turn over rate. Very stressful and managers don't seem to care about anything but themselves. Always getting yelled at by customers because not enough employees. Cant escape all the negativity even in the break room.
bad,"‚óèHour long lunch time"
bad,"Any job at Lowes depends if you have a good store manager or not.  Every year, the store numbers would increase with less employees. raises were 1 to 3%"
bad,"After 15 yrs of going nowhere in this store, I topped out at $14 as a stocker. Management is a joke and are terrible at communication and training. Benefits aren't bad but workplace was a circus! The store manager and human resource manager didn't have a clue when you really needed them, and most of the workers are more interested in slacking and then blaming others when things go wrong."
bad,great place to work. outdoor lawn & garden plumbing dept. just not enough money and no overtime at that time. Great equipment and Great people to work with.
bad,"When I started I loved it, we were a team, and we had an obtainable yet challenging bonus structure. Everyone got along and the management  actually helped us out on the salesfloor and they seemed to care about us as people. Not so much anymore. By the time I left managers on the store level talked down to employees and made long-time associates the enemy of why the store wasn't doing well. There is no wiggle room in schedule. I missed every family reunion 10 years straight. Employees who came in late, took long lunches were never addressed but if a customer said that you looked at them wrong.. the manager didn't even ask for your side of the story and either you got written up or a public dressing down."
bad,"too many interpretive set ups, you will succeed if you are an internal. You are expected to know what set ups look like from the year before, what ever looks good by store manager is the direction,"
bad,. This is a great job for a young man but long term I recommend doing something that allows advancement. Work is not hard and can be rewarding. Good job to get things going.
bad,"I feel LOWES takes some associates education for granted. There‚Äôs a lot of management that have little experience in managing individuals. I feel like those type of positions for those individuals should require a degree not someone you know. How can someone manage to make a career out of Lowe‚Äôs if educated is taken for granted. As far a a job goes, it would be a good temporary job till an opportunity arises."
bad,Management was involved in to many clicks along with very one sided mind sets. People are treated well if they are in the right click and others are treated as dirt if not and not given a fair response to anything that may be important. Unfortunately all of Lowe's works at local levels and are subject to and are at a  high school level of maturity. Just because sales are good doesn't mean the culture is especially in this day and age. Scandals upon scandals and people treated poorly if you don't go along with their mentality even though you may do a great job in your position.
bad,"Team member for DC. Ok job, worked weekends while going to school. Slows down during fall/winter. Given opportunity for voluntary time off. spring/summer hot, lots of hours. culture = glorified High school drama"
bad,"Would be a pretty good job if it wasn't for the rotating shifts. Thats the single worst part about Lowe's. Other than that, management needs help. They are very overworked."
bad,"Management at Lowes in Lancaster,PA was awful. No one knew what was going on because there was no communication. "
bad,"It was a job to get through college. If you want a career with Lowes I think you should reevaluate your life choices. Your worth more then that. It was just a job I had as a young man to get through college, it is a level entry job that takes no experience to do, so if that's what your into then go ahead get the job."
bad,Managers tend to disregard their responsibilities. Overwork people who actually contribute. no advance options. Lack of work culture. Managers tend to give to employees their duties. Lack of leadership.
bad,"Overall it was a ok place to work for depending on the management at the time.  The 12 years i have been employed we have gone thru 4 store managers about 10 assistant store managers and probable 20 department managers and about 6 hr managers.  "
bad,The location I was at was ok far as some employees n manager's. But the people I worked with on the unload team receiving associates sucked bad. I started out liking the job until the other associates showed who they really was. One would evert dam neat Sunday call in and b4 that he use to show up late everyday for about a month almost n nothing happened to him I use to sit back in observe it all until I couldn't take it anymore. N the other worker came to work for the women n he stayed n his phone most of the entire shift management knew it and nothing happened. I unloaded the trailer every day in after that I use to have to take pallets to they departments after just finishing unloading1450 pieces of freight. I left work sore n tired n would sleep majority of the next day because I use to be so tired from that job n it was part time but felt like a full-time job when u finished. Hardest job I ever worked n my life the associates I worked with were not good n didn't take it seriously to me so I left because of the associates I worked with there.
bad,"In this place, the work-life balance is poor unless you are in management other than that pay compensation is low as well. There is not a lot of room for advancement in the company."
bad,"Managers are bonused if they surpass budget goals by keeping labor hours at a bare minimum.  This is one reason you will always find cashier stations filled with only one or two persons and long lines waiting to get out of the store. "
bad,This is what the job I knew been trained long time ago for it this is a company that had only two stores in town I did manage one till have family problems then got demoted down to assistant manager where I was t mistreated discriminated against because I was a male got my back hurt there by being robbed from the gas station to the store there was no respect for male employee at that store it had a female manager that did not like
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs is poorly staffed, almost always, and it works in some locations. In my area of Seattle, it simply doesn‚Äôt. Employees are largely expected to assist an unreasonable number of customers at a time, which customers hate. Corporate employees often make promises to over-the-phone customers that stores can‚Äôt keep. Services such as deliveries and installations are offered, but schedule up to a month out, even though the website claims next day is available. So much fine print around here that the average consumer can‚Äôt help but become extremely frustrated. Poor staffing also means long lines. I used to like Lowe‚Äôs as a company, but recent corporate restructures and policy changes have turned it into a place I would never want to shop either. Prepare to be screamed at by customers without assistance or intervention from management, and to never be thanked for a very hard day of work."
bad,Management are very arrogant.  It seems to me that they did not want any communication between workers.  If you are not in their click they want you to work at all times
bad,"Lowe's started off as being and wonderful company to work with. They were very employee-focused and seem to have a true concern for the employee and what was best for them. Eventually however, management changed. When this happened the company but can take care less about the employee. The focus and purpose in which slows strived was lost. Turnover rate is significant."
bad,"Lowe's is a good place to start with, they will train you in a lot of different areas of the store and customer service. But they will also take advantage of you and your time/outside life."
bad,"Some of the people that work here a great but for the most part no one seems to get along, there‚Äôs a lot of talking behind backs and the management was poor. They seem to always be understaffed and you can tell it messes up employees moral"
bad,"It‚Äôs an okay place to work. Very few full time opportunities, and part time hours get cut all the time.  Since the shift in management and support managers, it‚Äôs not run well at all. Unorganized and messy store, very low moral amongst employees."
bad,"my particular job as isc was good, i learned a lot by trial and error, management was not helpful to me, the work place was a lot of drama and was not held accountable for mistakes they made, the hardest part of my job was management, up until the last three years of my position i enjoyed every part of my job."
bad,"Management and training were ridiculously inept."
bad,There is money to be made at Lowes but you have to stay there for a long time to get good compensation and vacation and benefits. Its good for extra money but not good for a career where you can advance quickly and make good money.
bad,"started out in customer service at $12.50/hour.  Poor training. You're expected to take calls from customers, mostly wondering where their order is.  Very boring."
bad,"Fast paced environment.  Understaffed departments,  Corporate does not give the support you need to do your job.  Outdated computer systems.  Store management scared to lose job or be demoted.  Constant corporate changes for store policies.  Coworkers had very low morale."
bad,few roles in this company are set hours.  shifting schedules makes for a tough home/work life.  managers are inconsistant with staff.  not enough corrective action taken when employees do not do their job
bad,"Nice atmosphere. Ability to grow in the company. Involves a fast paced environment and lots of hard work. Many fun activities throughout the months, such as bbqs."
bad,"This place was very bad to work for,  they over work and under pay.  Don't get hurt you will be made fun of or lowered to a less job and not allowed to really work."
bad,"Prepare to be treated poorly if you work here. Almost random hours, rude unprofessional staff and management. It is unlikely that you will get any hard working co-workers also."
bad,"A typical day is spent helping customers with product questions and with any concerns that they might have regarding  product, or staff. The day is typically 9 hours long and spent on your feet."
bad,"I was made a full-time loader in the Outside Lawn & Garden department after working part-time as a waterer for 4 months. If you are looking for a job that gives you extra responsibility without a pay raise, this may be the job for you. Also, the management at my location was terrible. Plenty of incompetent people are put in the management positions, which is a joke. They are content with letting people take the fall for their lack of communication. Oh, and one last thing, if you are wanting to move up the corporate ladder with Lowe's, it's extremely difficult and quite cliquey. So if you just got employed at Lowe's, good luck."
bad,At first this store was enjoyable to work at but the morale of the store has never recovered from the management restructuring. Since that happened management has suffered trickling down to the rest of the store. Management only focuses on project leads (interior/exterior) and credit applications.
bad,Coworkers were ok and company is ok as well but out of the north Canton location a few of the managers are very racist when it comes to people of color... if you're caucasian you will get respect... if I would go back.. Alliance or massillon branch would be the ideal place.. north Canton location is a different story...
bad,"lowe's is an alright place. they hire at a slightly higher pay rate than most. i advanced fairly quickly in the store. i enjoyed the people i worked with for the most part. however my store had big management flaws and a hectic schedule. we were constantly short handed and coverage was bad. many issues were addressed but never really taken care of. "
bad,"Difficult workplace environment. The amount of work you have to do and getting scored on it makes you work fast. Many of the decisions that come from the top do not really help the work environment, but make it harder to have a relax time."
bad,I have a job at a place that appreciates me as an employee that can generate 3 million a year. I have nothing against Lowes I would just like to be paid for my work.
bad,Got to be trained and work with power equipment such as Order picker and Reach Forklift class and the best part the job is you get to clock out and go home.
bad,"Continued to let experienced employees go, hired young unskilled employees to point customers to the correct department.  Took away commisions for sales.  Corporate didn't care, local management had to do what was instructed to them.  Sad..."
bad,"Each day started with whatever the manager requested.   I became an excellent forklift operant there."
bad,The management is a joke and you never actually have any notion of coverage for an area. You might have 10 people on a monday than its only you running four departments on a Saturday.
bad,"Always something to do, but never any time to do it. Customers always come in not knowing a single thing to start their projects, but its a great way to learn yourself and pick up the need to know information."
bad,"Management is awful. They don't provide support or back up when needed. The customer is always right, no matter how badly they treat you. They are always hiding in their offices and not helping with customers. Constantly delegating tasks, that are their job, but dont want to do."
bad,no support from management. Employees that work hard get treated the same as the employee's that never show up or do there job. How ever they do have good 401k and health benefits.
bad,Jobs are created to be short term work and not careers. This not the place to work for if you want a long term or career job. This is a great place for seasonal or high school/college students. You can learn a lot here.
bad,Some people who work here are fine with making whatever they are paid for the swing shifts they have to work.  Some others could be doing a lot better if they were properly motivated by management.
bad,"Not too bad a place to work if you don't plan on hanging around too long.  Too many changes in co-workers, so when you seem to have a system down pat, that could change drastically in a short period of time.  Management is a hit or miss.  Some are genuine people, while others are there to collect a paycheck and do as little as possible."
bad,"A typical day of work generally isn't too bad. Depending on when you get in it can be dead quiet or a rush with alarms and call-bells going on constantly."
bad,You are just a number here. After 13 years of loyal work my job was ended. No consideration for other positions. Just let go because we made too much money.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees, only sales numbers. poor management in delivery area, as managers are stretched thin across the store. no perks for delivery staff, only in store employees."
bad,"Training on the computer was long and comprehensive. Management was good and friendly. Standing was hard and had to get a Dr's note for a stool. Lots of picking up, sweeping, climbing ladders to stock shelves ,lots of standing and greeting customers. Employees were nice and helpful."
bad,I would have stuck at Lowes longer if I didn't have an injury. I enjoyed working there and the pay was good at the time. Everything there ean smooth and all employees were helpful to each other
bad,Good for a temporary part-time job. Did not stay at this job for a long time so not sure about advancement opportunities. Flexible scheduling and busy so time flies
bad,"Management didnt even know my name, though they claimed to be a family. My skills were way undervalued and they never respected my need for a  more fixed schedule"
bad,This was a good part time job while being in school. I enjoyed my time at Lowes and had a fun time being a cashier for Lowes. I am thankful that I had this experience.
bad,"Lowes was an ok place to work. I was underpaid, but the hours were good. No regular shifts, everyone is on a schedule. There can be room for advancement, but not likely."
bad,I applied for management positions over 50 times. There was a bad under current of retaliatory management.If you didn't play along with store politics you were not going up the chain.
bad,"the management at lowes is horrible, they are so into getting there own glory and step on everyone they can.  nobody really cares about the employee at all."
bad,"Working here was very stressful Not only just for me but it also put strain on my body as well , it is a fast paced job due to the fact we were on a limited time"
bad,"Long days,fast paced with no real appreciation for your accomplishments.  The inside joke is every time you accomplished anything it was followed up with that are you going to do for me next."
bad,Most employees are part time. They do not allow you enough hours to make it worth your time. Advancement is very slow. Lots of work for very low pay. Good for a second job or seasonal work
bad,"They have an HR MANAGER; that likes to listen to gossip,  and reacts"
bad,"Not a secure job, they will fire anyone for any reason. Management changed and the guys ego was so high he fired people based on his daily emotions..."
bad,a typical day at work was always asking for more help to unload the daily truck. As always only we never had help. me and the other co worker had to unload by our selves.
bad,"Management was awful. Good employees get overworked, then reprimanded if they don't complete their assigned duties in the 39- hours they're ""allowed"" to work.  Managers don't interact or encourage, much less pick up a phone when they're paged. There's a reason why the turnover rate is so high."
bad,I had a horrible time at Lowe‚Äôs I fell down a flight of stairs and busted my knee hurt my back doing a delivery for them. I didn‚Äôt receive compensation or Worker‚Äôs Comp. for several months after I was already working again management was horrible their hours were brutal there were days I would go in at seven in the morning and leave at midnight I would never go back in I would never recommend anyone to go to Lowe‚Äôs
bad,I loved my job and working with lowes but as a single mother with a special needs child they don‚Äôt work with you at all. They ask if there‚Äôs anything they can help with and all I needed was for them to work with me a little bit they refused. Managers act like they are God‚Äôs and your the gum stuck on the bottom of their shoe
bad,"It didn't feel like an actual job. It was pretty relaxed when i worked there, but for the most part if you didn't come in with the knowledge, you trained yourself on material and everything else in the store. If you were lucky the department had someone who was willing help you along the way."
bad,"Definitely poor management, couldn't hire enough people or qualified people, get mad when your job wasn't done fast enough  (even though the obvious fact of short handed crew) crew leaders were lazy and it was OK because they brown nosed with upper management and let the blame roll onto lower employees. A few cool people and hard workers though most of them were ""laid off"" to save a buck"
bad,"Assisting customers with sales or information for products being sold. How to meet and greet customers, information about the products Lowes sells, Management was great to work for. The workplace culture I worked in was a family oriented environment. Hardest part of working at Lowes was the amount of customers that come to the store I worked in, fast paced environment. Most enjoyable part was working with the power equipment and the people I worked with."
bad,"Started part time at outside loader"
bad,says it all in the summary. management is awful. not much good to say about this place other than its good to work at if you want a pay check. go to home depot. lol. i am only speaking for the location i worked at. not sure about others. i was a unloader/stocker. nothing to hard to do
bad,Not trained properly trained from day one. Inconsistant managers who gave different answers to associates. Moral is bad because of this and other issues. Never speak to you direct manager until something does not go the way they thought it should. No back up from management to the sales associates.
bad,"cut throat company that doesn't pay that well and is constantly changing their policies.  They regularly call you in early for store meetings, and often ask you to stay late."
bad,Lowes was a good job to have until I became a mother then it was a nightmare. The company has no family values and gives you a hard time is a day off is needed due to illness of your or your child.
bad,"I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Corporate leadership is a joke, the culture is too PC for the real world, the schedules for management is ridiculous, offers no work/life balance."
bad,"Many lazy workers who refused to do actual work. Management was all over the place and were not there to help when needed. Made for a stressful day, every day. Some days we were lucky to get both mandatory breaks."
bad,Inconsistent management using varying policies that are difficult to find and read to harbor fear and discipline amongst its management and associate staff. Policies executed unfairly and inconsistently.
bad,"If it wasn't for my raise in pay to account for my past of working as an assistant manager, I would have honestly left Lowe's long before seasonal ended. Not only is the atmosphere of Lowe's tacky, but the management is just as bad. I ended up leaving because of how horrible the management was at their jobs. You'll never look forward to working a day at Lowe's, even on the slow days with little to do. That's a shame really when Lowe's is a very successful company, but suffer with the horrendous clientele."
bad,I was bullied and no one would do anything some times never get a break and always told right when it‚Äôs time for me to clock out that I have to stay untell midnight
bad,"Constantly stressful, no employee recognition. Pay and benefits good.Customers are rude and unaccommodating. It feels like you're bothering management when you ask for help."
bad,"Really enjoyed working for the company until they changed management and fired almost everyone to bring in their own people."
bad,"typical day - quick pase"
bad,horrible work life balance. no communication between management. hours vary and are all over the place . always a problem with scheduling due to lack of communication between management
bad,management does not reward their best workers. management changes so often that there is constant upheaval. workers are unhappy. departments are understaffed which leads to frustration for workers and customers
bad,This is a retail location and as such there is nothing new to tell about working with grouchy customers and endless returns. Management was ok only with upper levels.
bad,"When I started at Lowe's 2 years ago, I was told by the employees that the culture at Lowe's was better than the average retail job.  This of course was when there were multiple ASMs, department managers, 1 selling system and a healthy amount of full-time staff.  The company is trying to advance financially by cutting the workforce any chance they get.  No more department managers means less knowledgeable leaders, and overworked SSMs. Once again, cutting full-time opportunities means less knowledgeable staff and putting part-time kids on the floor who have little vested interest in learning the department(s) they are working in.  If you happen to be a self-motivated worker, expect to be hired for one job, but told to work in different departments whether you want to/have any training whatsoever.  Lowe's has decided to pinch pennies by sweeping out the foundation from under the company.  Understaffed, under-trained, and underpaid staff in a customer service driven company is going to deter customers in the long run."
bad,"Kept eliminating departments and expected current staff to do the work of those individuals. Management was of no help, just ignored the problems and let employees fend for themselves. They love to fire employees, take more time to document mistakes than the do to train or solve problems. Any customer can get you fired."
bad,management was very inconsistent in their ways of managing reps and rules set forth were not enforced the same way with every rep. Also lack of career development and blatant favoritism.
bad,This job was simply a stepping stone part time job for me. The hours were flexible and the management worked with your current schedule to best accommodate you as best as they could.
bad,"fast pace work environment so i had to manage my time"
bad,"management was not up to par. did not enjoy working here, if you work hard you'll end up doing other peoples job. i was hired on part time but worked well over 40 hours a week and without the benefits of a full time employee."
bad,Management does NOT communicate with each other. so you are constantly redoing the same project over again because one manager doesn't like what the other manager said to do so you start over. Back stabbing management is in this store and store manager is the worse one.
bad,"On any given day you will be over worked. I have learned a lot, but that is not rewarded in pay and it can take a long time to advance. The management is hit or miss, but there are a lot of individuals that should not be in management positions. The work culture is getting worse rather quickly, especially since the workforce is constantly being cut and bonuses are harder to get every year. Hardest part of the job is the constant increase in workload with little to no increase in pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is of course the individuals I've met."
bad,"Stores do not follow company policy,  highly stressful.  no room for advancement.  management are not supportive unless you are under s certain age..."
bad,feet don't touch floor till 4 hrs into shift.computer.not very undrstaning managemen.frendy but distrustful.marale is down due to lack of employeesout of date computer systems
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone who has a bachelors degree or higher in education.  They treat you like you are less then what you are.  The pay was good, but the management was unorganized and didn't care about the customer."
bad,There is only Part Time Work during the day. If you want full time work then you will have to be patient (like a few years worth) or switch to nights. I personally switched to nights and it was the worst decision I ever made.
bad,"my typical day at Lowes is working w/customer getting them what they need giving the customer service. "
bad,"poor working conditions, unqualified upper management, customers have more rights than the people that work there.no one held responsible for their actions,"
bad,Lowes was a pretty nice place too work my 2nd job out of college pay was good hours wasnt to bad and supervisor was extra helpful...I would  still be working there if I had not moved to another city...meet lots of nice people enjoyed working there
bad,"First off I had great co-workers.  Many of them would go out of their way to help each other.  The store I was at was great up until the new management roll out.  That's when things went down hill.  The upper management only seemed to care about you if you constantly busted your back all day every day.  If you were anything lower than a specialist you were pretty much getting thrown around the store to different departments.  At one point I worked four departments at the same time.  If you show frustration or slow down a bit, you are told if you don't change your attitude you are fired.  For the amount of work you typically do in a day the pay is way to low.  There is very little room for advancement unless you meet management thinks you can qualify as an EO promotion."
bad,"Low work moral, nepatism very evident."
bad,"No real path to advancement, managers resent leadership talent and overwork those whom do their jobs, yet, don't care if some don't do their job at all. No sense scheduling, you will work for 8 days straight, have one day off, work one day, then have two days off; then they wonder why people call out sick frequently."
bad,i was brought on for lumber and customer service. they really did not offer alot of training and placed contractors before other customers. i was let go for helping an old lady and having the contractor wait his turn.
bad,My workplace and I have a love/hate relationship. I love the people I work with and the customers BUT when they began firing people they placed ALL of the work on the CSA‚Äôs. We are so extremely short staffed and then corporate wonders why people prefer to shop at our competitors. It‚Äôs people that have never stepped foot into Lowes or worked one single day at Lowes that all of a sudden gets the say in what we need and don‚Äôt need.
bad,Ok place wouldn‚Äôt never go back to work there. Didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. Besides the customers. I did enjoy the management part of the job. Not much to say on my review about lowes. Besides there fast past and there average towards there employees.
bad,Lowe's as a company is restructuring. Employees have been laid off or terminated on a regular basis for different reasons. Spending more than 15 years of my life at this company I decided for a change.
bad,"There is always something to be done, but the people who do it aren't always around when you need them. Mangers can be sketchy so it's best to be cautious."
bad,you really get a workout in the delivery position at lowes. it isn't the easiest job removing and installing appliances.the one on one with customers in the comfort of their home was a very nice thing to have.
bad,ALWAYS 5 STEPS behind when you walk in the door every day. staff minimal through the moon expectations no clears support in role. store manger always forget full about conversations involving staffing but asks why you are not making sales through the store.....not a career death sentence
bad,Lowe's works under a normal retail model. If you have ever worked in retail then you know what it is like to work at Lowe's. There isn't much more to say here.
bad,"was always understaffed for cashiers, never got the chance to advance. Management had their favorites. made it hard to advance, did like working with co workers."
bad,This company is going down the toilet. When I started with lowes they used to care about the employee since I've started three positions have been deleted company wide and the management that we do have are lazy and useless I know more than the managers that for me is a huge problem. Its become who you know and hwho hangs out with who after work. Not how well you do your job. Its a lot of playing favorites and employee morale is at an all time low.
bad,I appreciated being able to put my skills at organization to use. My skills were useful while working a register and maintaining aisles throughout the store. My favorite part of my experience was learning the office procedures and functions.
bad,good pay.bad managers. terrible atmosphere. worked there 13 years andit got so bad that i had to leave.they dont hire enuff people nd they expect you to do everything wile the managers sit in the offices all day.????used to be a great job.
bad,I was able to experience numerous positions at Lowe's. It was a great to work with the public and help them with all their home projects and be able to give advice/opinion
bad,the deli supervisor was very young and inexperienced. She stilled lived at home with her parents. She had no knowledge of cooking or organizational skills needed for her position.
bad,"A typical day consisted of front facing merchandise, customer assistance, and maintaining store appearance. I helped customers bring their home improvement ideas to reality but providing ideas and making recommendations to have project completion."
bad,Most coaches are helpful while some just want to do nothing or know nothing. Most team members were good and some were never happy. From a Performance Instructor too many people are allowed to stand around and talk too much. Operations manger on weekend and days show too much farvortism to certain coaches and team members.
bad,"varied job duties/titles. fellow workers for the most part pleasant."
bad,This place has some of the most disrespectful management I have ever worked for. They don't have any respect for you and give you a position but tell you how they want things run even if you are in management. Stating that is like why even be in that position if I cant run my own methods based on my abundant experience. Just not a good place to work at.
bad,Hard to manage when your store manager is more worried about being liked then holding people accountable.  If you want a job where you can call in sick whenever you want and still have a job??? Work for Lowe's.
bad,"They have alot of benefits but the overall restructuring is Eliminating alot of jobs and they are letting alot of good people go. It's alot like high-school, very clicky"
bad,"I loved the idea of Lowes, but the reality was we were over worked, underpaid, with no option to advance. Management was extremely inconsistent. They rarely praised success and berated failure."
bad,"Decent place to start as students. Not much growth opportunities, but you'll build excellent interpersonal skills and customer focused skills as an associate there. "
bad,Liked it but felt out of the loop about if I was doing a good job or not or what I needed to fix I think they should have showed more  affective ways when it came to showing employees what was wrong or right
bad,"restock, greet customers, did cycle counts, kept track of inventory, made sale displays, kept department clean, get sales tags up to date, get pick up orders ready for customers."
bad,"Plumbing department was a nightmare to keep up with so many tiny parts and customers never put anything back where they got it. Then you have a cart full of good backs to put back, all while trying to help customers."
bad,"Management does not know what is going on half the time, always short staffed and hardly anyone knows what to do. Low pay, weird hours, nothing consistent. and packages are not able to be located for the customers."
bad,we were preparing the food for the homeless and we would serve the homeless as well it was a gd work enviornment the hardest part of the job was the lack of help
bad,"It is a decent part time job. For full time work I would not reccommend it unless you are desperate of work. There are some good people that work that, but overall the management is horrible and it is just not an enjoyable place to work."
bad,The company has a wealth of brands and their house brands have the quality needed.  The organizational structure is stalled in the 90's.  Capital spent has not been spent well to modernize the processes.  Agility and speed to respond to markets are not a focus.
bad,"a typical day start with putting away freight that the over crews didn't put away, while assisting customer who enter the department while trying to finish putting away the freight."
bad,There is not adequate pay for the amount of extra work that is involved and scheduling is always messed up. I often have to go back and inform my boss that i am not available on certain days
bad,"I did my job well, outselling full time employees in Appliances, and did earn a promotion to Appliance Specialist, but from there, I ran into the ""who you know"" being more important than anything else.  The workplace deteriorated more, when Lowes chose to fire many long time employees, or redistribute them in the store, in lower paid positions.  They told those employees that didn't get fired, that they had a year to find a new job, or they'd be let go.  Many were department managers or supervisors, which caused undue stress in the workplace."
bad,"The management at this store is a joke, from the store manager to the ASM. No matter what they say do not believe it, store is full of favoritism, you will get in trouble for something that one of the managers darlings will not. They don't apply the rules equally. The pay is okay to start benefits are the best part but if you are in a job it is hard to fill no advancement is going to happen."
bad,"If you are full-time, you work for healthcare. The pay is just above ""why bother"" level and they are looking to cut employee expenses. Advancement is limited."
bad,"Lowe's as a company is on a warpath to destroy itself. They are cutting positions and hours like crazy. They will probably end up like Wal-Mart, little to no staffing."
bad,This job was just a dead end job for me. No opportunity to advance. I got paid minimum wage which isn't enough to do sustain myself. The work was tedious and I couldn't wait until the next step.
bad,co-works make the job alright but management is trash that doesnt understand how certain jobs work. when you see a dm sitting on their phone for the shift while their department is struggling you learn fast they dont care.
bad,It's retail. My personal experience was positive at the site I worked at but every site is different. The department you work in will have a great impact on how satisfied you are with your job.
bad,"In my two years at Lowes I have made some great relationships with staff and customers and have learned a lot about retail inventory management but the problem that I see and hear about is a lack of leadership. The store manager lacks the ability to manage store perception and creating a positive leadership team. Leadership just walk around and talk about how they have been ""putting out fires"" and have got nothing done, in rare cases I would accept this comment but it shouldn't be every time I see them every day. I also wanted to promote in the beginning but was very quickly tagged along that eventually lead to nothing."
bad,"The pay isn't bad, I started at $11.27. However, upper management is so hostile and ignorant to any real problems in the store that there is almost no drive or motivation to keep going. Most employees and lower management stick to their guns, and try to help hourly associates as much as possible, but the ones who wanna move up turn into snotty brown nosers that stomp you into the dirt for even thinking about thinking outside the box. All this on top of a wacky schedule that is never the same as last week, you'll be opening just as fast as you closed the night prior. If you take a job with lowes, be prepared to have no personal life, no weekend life, do other employees jobs because they are hiding from irate customers and horrible management, and working your butt off just to get absolutely zero recognition, think military. Try to stay away from customer service, the phone never stops ringing, departments never answer their lines or overhead paging, your lines will be filled with angry customers on hold and you're expected to talk on the phone while greeting customers, processing returns, and providing customer service."
bad,"My typical day was to clean the bathrooms, mop floors, get trash, &ride samboney machine. Keep up with ems reports and resolve any repairs in the store."
bad,"Hours are Terrible!!!! Routing shifts. Never know if you are coming or going, Pays well but super hard on family lives!!!! Management only cars about the number of sales"
bad,I loved my job as the HR Coordinator.  I didn't like how corporate can come in and change the rules and force me out of my job just because my sister became a manager.  I think the morale of the store is very poor. Upper management does a very poor job of training and taking care of the employees.
bad,"You are not respected by management! It is very hard to get promoted as well since you need to be in the ""good ole boy club"""
bad,"I liked what I did and learned alot about the products Lowes carries. The hours and days I worked were different day to day and week to week. The management wasn't easily accessible,"
bad,Was fired and given no reason. Too short staffed to do a great job most of the time.Very poorly run company. Managers spend a lot of time when there is no staff telling you why there is no staff. You must think mature adults are really stupid.
bad,Work was very busy summer and spring but kind of boring during fall and winter. Most ASM were great leaders asnd huma resources h awas great to work with as well.
bad,"GM was reducing staffing giving part timers only 10-12 hours a week, and when you did go to work you could never finish things because departments were neglected."
bad,"like alot of retail, its all who you know. Make friends with managers early, or you will forever be stuck as a peasant. Treated like you are replaceable, even when you carry the whole team."
bad,"For whatever reason Lowes is choosing cost cutting over customer service and product on the shelves.  Associates are stretched from end to end of the store while call boxes are going off left and right.  "
bad,It was okay. Need to increase their pay. Needs more improvement. I like the environment but it's a little too self centered for me. Managers were super cool.
bad,There is no job security at Lowe's. The company recently removed department managers and said managers were notified by email - this included managers that had been with the company over 20 years. This is no way to tell someone they are out of a job and must find other employment. The new people hired to take the various departments managers place do not have the knowledge/experience the managers had and the customers know this. Think of a school that removed all the teachers and then wondered why the students knew nothing: because there was no one available to teach them.
bad,Some days can be easy fast paced and fun others can be stressful. Handling customer complaints and issues. Making sure it things get addressed in a timely manner. Overseeing customer installations and making sure everything is working correctly.
bad,"Not much flexibility with work times"
bad,"Starting as a seasonal employee and then going to part time I was working full time but was only listed as a part time employee.  This prevented me from being able to receive any benefits of a full time employee or a pay raise.  Work/life balance is very difficult because of the constantly changing schedule and work hours, this prevents you from making any set plans more than two weeks in advance unless you take time off.  Even with that being said, I quit working here because of the low pay and management culture of a large corporation that cares very little about their employees."
bad,"It was a easy flowing job , very easy I liked it until they started cutting hours calling me telling me not to come to work mess and other things going on with the new people that came in"
bad,Upper management has no idea what they are doing and you will get in trouble for the most minimum mistakes just because they don't like you personally. If you're on their good side you'll be fine to do what you want and move up in the company.
bad,"not the same company it used to be...not employee friendly as it could be..needs to follow policy consistently and more accountability, less favoritism"
bad,"ok i guess, decent job for the area, lack competitive pay and advancement. management isn't really that good. they show favoritism to certain people. i wouldn't wanna work there again."
bad,"If you like a dynamic and unpredictable environment, Lowe's is for you.  I personally was afforded great opportunities and worked with terrific people.  I did not always agree with the overall strategy; but I was not C level."
bad,"The managers go on break when they feel like it, they make others take breaks when they feel like it. They give you a hard time if you have children and want to schedule change and for little pay."
bad,Management does not listen to desires of the employees if it has any possible conflict with their schedule. The compensation you receive does not come close to what it needs to be and you are expected to fill any holes they might have at a moments notice without warning.
bad,"Learn as you go job. Typical workday consist in helping customers, stocking shelves keeping department clean and if you work in lumber cut wood on the panel saw"
bad,"Self check out is the bane of existence, but some of the customers can be awful! Though customers can be really awesome and sweet!! With any retail job people try to cheat and steal and can't confront the customer even if you bluntly saw it happen, but to report to management and write up a report claim!"
bad,Management is below par and treat staff in appropriately. I enjoy my coworkers but have not had the best experience with management! It's a good first job or second job
bad,"It is good for students for a short duration of time and for full-time seeking employees, but if you start as a cashier or a loader. Do not expect to make it anywhere from there"
bad,Customers got use to taking advantage of Lowes. Often times just came in to make a deal. Most of the job was great as co-worker most of the time wanted to do a great job.
bad,"Genco, I've obtained most of my training in logistics, team leading, and management. Shipping and receiving, import and export. Learned to communicate internationally with varies country and different states."
bad,"Bad Management, Delivery Service is terrible, Management only feels the need to Suck up to every customer that comes around. Fully Expect Drivers to work 12 hour days everyday or maybe even 14 hours with barely pay, and Get yelled at by customers all day. Needs improvement"
bad,not happy with there policies. that was the whole reason i got fired was because they don't have an official forklift license it is one provided by lowes.
bad,Favortism and discrimination is the best way to describe it. Sexism and racism takes place here as well. I believe the only get advancement here is through flattery.
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for. However, since their reorganizing, now, not so much. It seems that even tenure veterans are being fired because they threaten the company's bottom line. They are not ""Customer Centric"" like they claim, they only care about money.  Behind closed doors they tell employees not to spend time with customers that don't look like they have money to spend. They are on a spiraling downhill path to destruction."
bad,"Management is very sketchy, there are people who are favored more than others. The pay was very decent but my concerns were never addressed. Overall I wouldn't work here"
bad,Pay is not bad but the job is pure BAD. The manager is a total lier and will cut anyone's throat that gets in the way. I would never recommend Lowes..
bad,Meeting new employees . Traveling to different locations.  Coworkers created a friendly and professional work envi environment.  Learned to assembly new appliances s.
bad,The job started out great and then some management changes hapoened and the company is just going down hill. They started firing people and taking away a lot of the incentives that made everyone love the company.  When i first started i felt like family and when i left i felt like a piece of meat.
bad,The employees are very lazy. No one want s to help anyone. Their disrespectful to each other and the customers. I would not recon-mind them to anyone at all.
bad,"If you want to get ahead don't work here. It's for people going to school or perhaps elderly folk who want a job to take up some of their time. I would not consider this place a ""career""."
bad,Lowes can be a fun place to work if you want to work. But just remember to work safe and keep to yourself.This environment can be very stressful and cutthroat.
bad,Lowes is changing. The work atmosphere is very difficult. Have been very loyal working at Lowes and had great coworkers. All this changes. When you find a coworker who clicks STICK with THEM
bad,"help customers everyday finding product and loading product, getting karts for customer to shop, didn't let me move up in the company pay didn't go up much"
bad,"Very boring, and the workers were not very friendly.  I don't think I would ever want to work for this place again. It was just a fill in job, until a real job come around."
bad,"So, when I worked in dedham, the pay was great considering I wasn't very experienced. However, Brockton lowes pays a dollar less, and the whole place is corrupt. Don't come to Brockton. They will underpay you, they will take your bonuses, and they won't give you your break."
bad,Management is very driven to receive their bonus while you will never meet yours because the company continues to make it more difficult for store associate non salary employees to achieve it. Low paying and very high work load. There is no drive in associates since the reconstruction of positions. My yearly raises are around 0.25 cents meanwhile minimum wage is increasing faster then my pay.
bad,"If you want to work where your just a number turning numbers then it's fine. Otther than that,  from the top down honesty is not something upper management feels they owe to the employees."
bad,"Started out as a good job then I went on a deployment overseas and when I got back the HR and Management kept giving me the run around about things such as scheduling and hours. Went from a seasonal associate at 20 hours a week to 6 hours on a good week. Fellow employees are nice but as for this particular store the HR and Management are a joke. Loss Prevention doesn't do their job, you'll constantly find things where people have stolen/attempted to steal items. Over all the Guntersville store isn't worth the time or effort."
bad,"Typical corporate experience, employees are not cared about nearly as much as they should be by the corporate offices.  Little room for advancement, swing shifts make raising a family difficult.  Overall not a great environment."
bad,I won't work there again. I mean you have your nice people but for the most part its not a good place of you looking to move up in the company.  But that's just my opinion.
bad,"It is very good company to work."
bad,"Part time job, good opportunity, good pay, nice management staff, limited growth opportunity and over time hours"
bad,Limited and non competitive employment opportunities. This company represents the failures of the long term care field. counter productive management that is reflective of poor implementations of policies and procedures.
bad,giving my best and making the customer completely satisfied when they leave the store was the goal. Some of the people are great to work with but some are not. They just did a revamp of every store which took 2800 jobs away company wide and at least another 400 within another year
bad,"Easily the most toxic work environment I have been a part of. Moral is very low and every one in the store is looking for a way out. Management is a joke, we just went through this restructure and every one knew who the favorites were that get the new positions and sure enough we were right."
bad,Lowes need improvement! Management sucks.  Restructure going on to increase pay of management that they kept.  Gave others the boot.  Very unfair the way they treat employees
bad,"My training with this company was almost non-existent. I was sat down in front of a computer and then thrown on a register with very outdated technology, expected to understand. The store was in the middle of a transition and was a mess. I really tried to enjoy my time there but management played favorites, they wouldn't let me be full time and go to college (which I was promised), we had very disgruntled employees and people quit often."
bad,"If you're seeking managenment with this company you need to prepare yourself for the possibilities of being laid off. Lowes is true to it's motto, "" Never stop improving"", that means to better their stores and to bulid more stores you may lose your job for them to do so."
bad,corporate schedule was a joke... no room for life /work balance. off season should have allowed for some flexibility of shorter hours. based on the amount of time put in during spring and summer season.
bad,"I had some medical issues which had me out of work for a while. So I had to be replac"
bad,"I was glad I work at Lowes. I learn more about tools than I could have ever learn by reading books. It's just really hard to be able to get a full time position or part time . If you do not have one you will most likely not stay. If you are just looking for work for a short time it could work. The ASM where not good at making the schedule. They always scheduled me on day, I asked to not be scheduled. I started with the same schedule from day one and it never changed the whole time I worked there, but still messed up my schedule."
bad,Started as a seasonal employee. Got hired in after season. Got a quarter for a raise. Then they cut my hours down to 15-20. Not so great. Over all i gained just enough experience to branch out into shipping and receiving at a production facility.
bad,"I enjoyed helping customers at Lowe's and also enjoyed many of the employees. The management on the other hand, not so much."
bad,"Felt like I was constantly butting heads with the other cashiers and the head cashiers....they were too quick to play favorites and if you were not one of their ""pets"" good luck on hours"
bad,Not a good place to work. Management has no idea what they are doing. They tell employees not what their actual job will entail but just the basics. Once you start working things will take a turn for the worse and your frustrations will not be conveyed well. Management likes to blame their mistakes in the lower level employees when things don't turn our right. You are told to get in line and shut up or find a new job. I was told to only speak about the positives and focus on the positives. If you wanna work here keep you head down and let them beat on you and you'll probably work there forever. The second you let them know their mistakes yout will he ousted. All of the managers giver for each other. A ASM once told me of I repeated anything he said he would lie and deny it and tell the accuser that I was the one lying. Great place to be bullied.
bad,This company did not fufill my expectations. I didn't get very many hours and the pay was sub-par. This is why I had to leave.
bad,Store mid management was more concerned about themselves that the employees. Were treated more like cattle than human workers
bad,This company's managers do little to support their subordinates.  The pay is extremely low for the heavy lifting and labor intensive work required to be done.
bad,Many different characters inside the store. Often had people who were not properly trained in the field they were given. Store itself isn't a bad store it's moreso the managers there that factor in the outcome of the day and how high we're staffed that day to if we're shortstaffed because the manager didn't want to give out many hours.
bad,"When working at this location the parts that I did enjoy were some of the coworkers that I was able to get to know & become great friends with along with some of the customers as well. When coming to the job though with the of a high turn over rated, very poor management/leadership, couldn't be professional & much more it made me learn that I knew the retail job life wasn't for me after working for it for many years & seeing many things."
bad,"You don't receive proper training. No one has time to train you because they all have other jobs to do. Nearly a month after I started, I still had not been trained to do the job they hired me to do. Most of the management team didn't seem to care, with the store manager being especially detached from the people working for him."
bad,management at lowes was absolutely terrible. not to mention i was treated very disrespectfully by my department manager. i have had customer compliments and praises for helping them and all this particular manager couldnt care less.
bad,I loved working with this company. They worked around my schedule. They always let me off when I needed off. Very nice staff.
bad,Just be ready to work the minute you clock on .  I was hired as a seasonal worker but they over worked some employees . Although it may seem impossible for someone to get over worked it's possible at lowes
bad,Lowes tried to take over my life and if you do not kiss the mangement team you will get no where in the company. Pay sucks and i would not recomend to work there
bad,I can not comment on this Job Sorry. I have a Lawyer Looking into this job and I have nothing to say about the 5 years I worked for them Sorry
bad,Seasonal pay is terrible. A few of the managers are very helpful and hardworking. Fellow employees that are full time are mostly lazy and lack drive/don't seem to care about good customer service or their jobs. If seasonal be prepared to get dropped immediately without a heads up or notice in a very un-proffessional way without so much as a handshake or a thank you for all of your hard work. Very rewarding in the sense of accomplishment of helping ordinary people reach their goals for their home.
bad,Too Many bosses not enough leaders and no team work. When i got hurt on the job it was like i never worked there. What a family.
bad,"The job was easy, some jobs more physical than others. Most management was helpful. Always did my job and  whatever else they needed...Upper management were snobs!!, Once at Top Out pay they look for a reason to fire you. Very unfair management practices happen daily!!!  Didn't even receive exist interview, WOW THAT seems like a MANAGEMENT NO,NO!!!"
bad,some days are slow and management doesnt recognize the hard work and that people go out of their way to go the extra mile. They do make sure to get on you and write you up if you do something wrong.
bad,"A typical day consisted of unloading the truck at 5 am and stocking inventory, doing all paperwork before 11 am everyday.  Having to lift refrigerators, washer and dryers by yourself.  Most of my management staff was really good to work for but then you had some that was hateful, disrespectful, yelled constantly could not talk without yelling, and very unfair.  The hardest part of the job was getting blamed for things that you did not do or had no control over.  Asking to do things that you didn't like and when refused was yelled at in front of customers and employees.  I would say the best part of any day was when you could help a customer and they truly appreciated everything you did for them.  The thing I did like was at least when you was top salesman in your district which I was for 5 years at least they did express gratitude for all the hard work I had done."
bad,While only working in my department for 6 months I was the second most senior member and had had 5 different managers and as many supervisors.   Do not expect much of any training here.
bad,mgt did not help with customers alot of the time.  some days you never got lunch or breaks.  not enough people to cover your dept while you were out
bad,the biggest problem is a lack of communication. No one talks to anyone they just expect you to know what is going on and also a lack of training they put you on the floor to help customers without knowing your surroundings.  The  management is nowhere to be found when you actually needed them to be.
bad,Constant turnover of employees makes it difficult to have a steady work atmosphere. They preach customer service but ever increasing training and tasking does not put us in position to help customers.
bad,"A typical day at Lowes is extremely stressful, Management is just as  bad as the workers. Customer service sucks. The co workers are mean and impolite . The most enjoyable part is putting a smile on my customers face and making a remarkably lasting impression"
bad,"After working for Lowes for 8 years and 6 months, I learned that you have to be able to over come the constant staffing changes and supervisors and co-employees that come and go. There are some long term employees but they are few and far between. The average work day consists of doing your assigned tasks as fast as possible and then if your work has been completed you help complete as many other assigned task as you can. I  Learned to operate narrow aisle lift's and order pickers and a lot about retail warehouse customer service. Management was basically out for them selves and their career advancements. They very rarely honestly wanted input from the rank and file. Even if such input would be of greet use to the company as a whole. As a general rule, it was a dog eat dog situation with a lot of  the co-works I worked with, but not all of them. What a shame. In my opinion, a lot of people need to truly work as a team and stop being so self centered. I liked meeting and helping the public and a lot of wonderful co-workers that came and went over the years that I was employed at Lowes."
bad,"every night was repetitive as the last, I learned to multi task how to get my work done in a respectable manner time. Management was okay. hardest part of the job was working in bad weather."
bad,horrible place to work if you are a CSA; overly excessive work load for minimum wage. on top of the fact of having disrespectful coworkers. i would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,Lowes is an ok place to work. But there is a shift. A shift towards keeping all associates part time.  And I would like more now.
bad,Fun place to work.  Management team had plenty of opportunities to grow.  I was not able to learn enough to ever have the chance to move up.
bad,"The pay is competitive but your hours are not guaranteed beyond 10 hours if you are not a full-time employee. There is also the probability  that you will have to stand on your feet on a concrete floor with no break for 4-5 hours depending on how many hours you are scheduled for.  Observed quite a few employees with feet, knee and leg issues."
bad,"management isn't good. "
bad,"Busy, customer service friendly store."
bad,"I unfortunately worked in the lowest grossing store in the market. We got Assistant Store Managers who's performance was low in their prior store, and were on their way out if they didn't improve. Likewise the store managers were either on their way to becoming unemployed, or were just promoted to Store manager and being groomed for another store. In my 3 years at my last store I saw 4 Store managers come and go. As well as having 8 Assistant Store managers. The constant threat of the store being shut down was overhanging. My store was built for the short term, because corporate was going through a lot of red tape trying to open a store 8 miles away. Management ideas, views on structure, and selling methods changed every three to six months. In short it wasn't the best atmosphere to thrive in."
bad,Long days in a depressing environment in a loud busy warehouse.  Very early start and if you live outside of milton you are left with only time to sleep in your free time.
bad,"Work was great, not much advancement or benefits available. Staff was great and management was good. Love getting to grow relations with customers and be of assistance."
bad,"Poor management, unfriendly staff, over worked and underpaid. Concerns don't get taken care of. Poor choices as to who advances and who doesn't."
bad,Lowes was a unique company to work for. We had quotas to meet but were coached on better ways to meet them. They were family oriented and gave employee discounts. They were very strict with attendance
bad,"Despite many wonderful coworkers, Lowe's is not an enjoyable work environment.   A kitchen designer actually spends more time watching other departments yet still has to hit their sales numbers on a monthly basis.  The scheduling takes forever to get used too when you can work three different shifts in one week's time.  Lowe's is really not geared for the kitchen remodel industry since they never advertise their remodeling services and give little backing to their design teams.  I still really enjoy what I do but would prefer it to be in a remodeling firm and not a retail environment."
bad,"i would not reccommend any one to work for Lowes, the way that they treat you is reaaly bad. they treat you like a step child and when there a problem they throw you under the bus"
bad,"It;s a good place to work but the store manger has poor management and does not help with the store. You dont get breaks and if you have to many doctors exucse they will let you go, it doesnt matter if it's their fault that you always have to go to the doctor."
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's Marketplace starts with counting the office.  Then verifying all the registers.  Paperwork.  If it's truck day, you may have to stop and unload trucks.  The best part is servicing the customer and afterwards at the end of the day, I can say no complaints and I served as best I could."
bad,"Managers weren't readily available when help was needed. learned to problem solve on my own, which is a positive skill that i will take with me. co-workers were helpful when they could be and fun to be around. I enjoy working with the general public and am very patient with people."
bad,You can stay busy if you want to stay busy. I liked being cross trained.The company is growing and expanding in various areas.
bad,"Working for Lowe's was boring. There were not very many opportunities to sell products. You will probably just run the cash register, and randomly work where they need you to. Easy job and nice people."
bad,"This position is about what you would expect it to be in a retail environment. A typical day was answering phones at the service desk and the departments not answering their calls, being under staffed, and receiving very little help from other departments. Also, if a customer did not like something you said (such as not taking back a return) they always want to speak to your manager and when that happens the manager will always throw you under the bus in front of the customer."
bad,Lowe's US division operates at a more structuresd and organized environment. The Canadian division does not like to follow the same rules and pushes back to Canadianize the operation. Unfortunate for the individuals that represent the DC and communicate and work with the US head quarters.
bad,"I drove the delivery truck. IF lifting heavy appliances is not hard for you to do this job is easy. Trucks are not maintained in the best possible shape, but do meet DOT requirements."
bad,"Standard retail job with above average pay for similar jobs in the area.  High speed, high stress, low responsibility job."
bad,To obtain a personal and professional challenging position that will utilize my experience and educational skills while providing an opportunity for professional development and career advancement
bad,"Poor training, some rude supervisors, overworked employees, biased employee advancements and placements, below minimum break/lunch/rest periods, strenuous working conditions."
bad,"Lowe's pay's above minimum wage , but why pay that much if you cant keep people for the whole season. I was seasonal and I was only the a month before I was let go because they weren't doing good in sales, when I was supposed to be there for 5-6 months . I wouldn't of had a problem with being let go if they told me a couple of weeks in advance. They let me know I was being let go in 3 days, that caused a lot of stress because i'm still looking for a job."
bad,"I worked at this job for 6 years,the first two were productive.The last four were spent as a front end cashier.no future for advancement.I was very unhappy with this dead end job.no future"
bad,"A typical day for my position, Installed Sales Coordinator, would include sorting through faxes, making and answering numerous calls and emails, gathering products for installers, inspecting job sites, assisting sales specialists with install issues, and doing various jobs for the store proper as needed."
bad,Management is not very good. They don't help and you don't get any training. They don't work as a team. Not a career place.
bad,"I liked what I did there. I got to be outside all day, retrieve carts, and helping customers but man this is the most clicky work environment I've ever worked for. Snakes everywhere. The head cashiers are just the worst. All of them were ego maniacs. They thought they were better then everyonr, they all had no back bone and we're always ready to throw a cart boy or cashier under the bus. The managers would always allow them to get away with their incompetence. Managers were a joke. They expect you to seek out training for necessities such as work the machines (which for a loader would be not training a cashier the register). It basically you against the world if you ain't going to kiss the keyster. The store manager had some sort of self righteous entitlement. Would throw award meetings just to boast about him and his stores"
bad,The managers are the worst I've ever worked for.Lowe's also makes you work overtime so if you have a family life don't get a job there.
bad,they did not care about what their employees were doing and their personal life if one of their employees just lost a loved one they don't give them time to grieve
bad,"I was a assembler, a loader, and an early morning stocker for the Macon, Ga store."
bad,Big Box retail very competitive and long hours for very little pay.  Difficult to move up into Salary management.  Co-workers are great.  The best part of the job is working with good people.
bad,this job was ok but way to much droma.There is like noone left there who started with the company they all got blind sided.
bad,the company overall was good but the store i worked at wasn't so great. I don't miss working there but i do miss some of my co workers
bad,"Not a career. It was better in the past when a good/great salesman could make commission and had an incentive. Those days are long gone. The pay structure has changes several times for the worst. Discounts went away bonuses were harder to obtain to the point of impossibility. Unfortunately This goes for all stores. I know, I worked in six. It's a great stock to own they did offer a 15% discount on stock options but they bought twice a year and you had no say on when to buy. It had some perks but they slowly went away. It went from a great job, to a good job to to well... a job."
bad,"Managers do not give you any credit and allow you to be treated terribly by your ASM. Unfortunately you are completely expendable to this company, they just hire the next person."
bad,A typical day would be taking plants off the tables and moving them to carts. I have learned that some plants are very heavy. There were no management. I had one coworker that was enjoyable to be around. Hardest part had to be pushing very heavy carts in 100 degree weather. Most enjoyable part was the pay was good
bad,"A typical day at work was coming in, clocking in, and ringing up customers until either a break or you left for the day. Coworkers were like a family, while management... Rarely got involved with the registers. Instead of jumping on to help when the store was short-handed on cashiers(A common occurrence), they called short-staffed departments to send people they couldn't spare up to the front to jump on registers, and then questioned why nobody was helping customers on the floor!"
bad,"Doesn't pay that much, but it's an ok place to work.  The schedule is what one might expect for retails hours.  They try to give 2 days off a week in a row."
bad,Management is horrible and plays favoritism. you only get promoted if the store manager likes you. They work you like a dog and it won't stop until you file a compliant with hr But even then they only listen if you threaten to call corporate. They also never follow store policies unless it benefits them.
bad,Very challenging and not all shifts do the same job pays good  the work is very hard  a lot of heavy lifting enjoyable part of the job is driving the equipment .
bad,"Typical day at Lowe's was very stressful!  The 11 months I was employed there 5 VP's were discharged, 8 Directors were separated, had 2 CIO's, 4 different bosses, and had to re-interview for my job 3 times."
bad,"Basically, to sum it up, if you were not in the managers clique you were instantly frowned up! Management is very judgmental! They like to ""be friend"" the lazy ones and criticize  the ones that actually work! One head cashier that was very lazy kept getting gifts from upper management, for what, who knows! It definitely wasn't from hard work! The hours and days were awful! I was there for 7 months and had to work every holiday, while others were granted every one off. And the gossip! HA! WORSE then middle school girls! And nothing was ever done about it! You're a male that's friends with a female, or vice versa? Not at Lowe's! Everyone up front will have you sleeping with anyone you talk to. Overall, yes I did learn a lot from working there. Made some friends (very few) but glad that experience is over!"
bad,A typical day at Lowes is challenging at times due to lack of help. I love working in the management position and helping others. It is a very rewarding job to be able to help someones day go as smooth as possible. But the workload can be overwhelming without help. Due to the fact we are very short staffed a lot of work is to be done with no help. Hope fully in gaining other employment I can actually work with a team that I can grow with.
bad,"Fast paced Business to Business selling, enjoyed multiple market channels and selling a large variety of businesses."
bad,"not many hours to go around, bad pay and bad customer service"
bad,"call center, alot of computers and alot of yelling customers"
bad,it wasn't very good to work there lots of bad tempered ppl weird ppl angrey bosses bad pay and not enough hours
bad,"* Handled  the front desk cash register, handling any cash transactions during shift and made sure the drawer was kept in balance."
bad,"typical day helping customers "
bad,"customer are very rude and management support them, there is not enough coverage associate for departments so the customer service is not good, lazy, unhelpful and unfair  management. the big bonus check go to their pockets not to sales associates or specialist."
bad,"Typical day starts off slow then busy trying to help customers with small staff. Try keeping the store clean, safe and ready for customers."
bad,"This is a okay job if you just got out of high school. Everybody there gossips like little kids! The hours suck, and they play favoritism over people who've been there longer and the ones who actually work! If u like excitement every day, this would be an excellent job for u as well! There's nothing like getting robbed every night or getting angry customers on you, because you wouldn't except there stolen credit cards or fake money. Like I said this is not a job for actual grown ups, who are older than 19."
bad,"forklift driving, cleaning up customer spills, helping customers load there purchases"
bad,"The store I worked at didn't follow protocol as to job openings. When a position became vacant they didn't post it, they either filled it with a crony from another store or filled it from within. "
bad,working at party city in santa rosa wasn't the best place to work management wasnt very helpful and very rude. My co- workers were very friendly witch helped.
bad,The company is a good company to work for its benefits.  I would not recommend to work but only as an hourly associate and not a salary manager unless you do not have a family.
bad,"My average day in pro sales was get to work and work on what the person on the shift before hand had not done since they got 7 breaks while if I went to bathroom I was criticized.  Also always covered lumber, delivery, tools, hardware, and millwork while they all went to lunch together and would leave me and another person to cover the whole end of the store.  Management was nice enough, but full of broken promises, passed up for advancement multiple times, I guess maybe I should have been sleeping with a manager like everyone else."
bad,"work every weekend"
bad,no room for improvement at all. the managers are way to wishy washy about policies.
bad,"Lowe's has the potential to be a great place to work. The pay is good and for the most part the people are friendly. However, the management teams are very reactive instead of being proactive. Nothing happens until there is a problem and then they play pass the buck. They say family is first but do not allow for you to have any schedule restrictions for the full time employees or they will not hire you. It's bad enough you are forced to work holidays instead of being with your family but they don't even compensate you for it as the only paid holidays are Christmas and Thanksgiving."
bad,"I had been with Lowe's for several years and I have seen some poor management in my time but never as poor as this. It starts in the corporate offices and trickles down to individual store managers.  There is little support from management to develop employees, little coaching and an ""iron fist"" mentality to rules and regulations.   Retail scheduling is difficult but here it is a ""take it or leave"" style of scheduling."
bad,"working very hard every day"
bad,"Lowes has the tools available to develop amazing customer service but it doesn't utilize them.  I am greatly disappointed because it affects the interaction between customers and employees who are left to fix issues on their own.  There's no training or development for employees.  Lowes has excellent training modules online but employees aren't allowed time to utilize them.  The current systems aren't working and I feel terrible when I have to deal with customers who have to wait a long time until I can finally resolve their issues, the systems need to be reviewed and updated."
bad,"Not allot of opportunity to advance or grow. "
bad,The security of my job is at risk daily. They fire people by the handfuls. I want to work somewhere that knows people are humans and make mistakes. some mistakes are forgivable so are worthy of being fired for. they jump the gun too quick on some of these people.
bad,"Management don't care about there employees, a lot of favoritism going around the DC"
bad,"I started at Lowes and wanted to be a manager from the start. I worked hard, rarely had any complaints, and made my way to an assistant manager. I continued to work hard and attempted to be the best that I could and lead by example. Honestly, it was a decent store to work for until my last few months there when all the changes started happening."
bad,My  typical work day there I would just stand at the end of my register and wait on guest. I rarely seen my boss or the head cashier. I like to stay busy fast paced environment.
bad,el area de trabajo el comedor los sanitarios siempre limpios.
bad,"a typical day at work would from 1:30-10:30; working a full 5 hours without a breaks, only the restroom is appropriate.  Extremely busy with no back up help. Also noting that 5 hrs could be a full shift for another employee. Going to lunch until 7:30 leaving 2 hours and a half left to complete the closing duties within the last hr. Management is careless regarding employees, during the day they don't really allow for employees to explain situations. Assuming that the managers are busy. The hardest part of the job is having to working on three computers at once, no help while also answering the phones when no operator is present. The most enjoyable part is being able to go home."
bad,"Lowes is a good, place to work, the time schedule which changed, a few weeks after I started, was hard to adjust to. Hours went from early day to overnight. I worked in warehouse, processed incoming shipments in preparation for stocking."
bad,At the six month mark a lot of people including myself would be let go. The benefits would be nice and you learn a lot of skills from lowe's it was just not a long lasting job environment.
bad,.the main thing was merchandising...staying stocked and priced....not customer service or sales....only thing in regards to customers is to greet them  other than that there was no sales training...you got a book to some electronic courses and you were good to go.
bad,"clean the patio"
bad,I'm currently in the process of graduating Electrical Trainee trade school where I've been learning and doing different wiring and pipe bending and I'm looking to gain more experience in the field. I hope I can receive an opportunity from your company.
bad,I enjoyed the opportunity that I was given at lowe's to grow as a leader.
bad,A typical day at Lowe's consists of running around doing everything twice. There are way to many managers and not enough employees. The world that has been created by lowe's is one of the use them up and hire fresh.
bad,Pay and benefits aren't bad. Doesn't treat employees very well.  Expected to sacrifice family time and outside life at the drop of a dime. Stressful environment.
bad,Okay place to work but no room to grow with company. I really would not make a career out of Lowes.
bad,"Love working with people, but the store lacks team work and communication. We have a lot of fun with our customers and each other making sure when they leave the store they have had the best customer service."
bad,"It appears when you stay too long, they find some reason to get rid of you."
bad,8hour days which consist of doing your job and others as well. I have learned the more you know in the company the more the mgmt. will try to take advantage of you and there is no incentive for that. the hardest part of the job is all the heavy lifting.
bad,a typical day at lowes....standing at the register waiting on customers to walk to the front to be checked out. I love meeting new people and had favorite customers. I made them laugh and and they made my day. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would b upset because they have received poor customer service on the floor.
bad,i liked alll my co workers at lowes . the con was that the managers werent very helpfull when there was a problem
bad,I will say one thing Lowes is not the place for me. they over work your load schedule and Management is a Disgrace. i often wondered why there was 14 people in a 12 month period in the tool and Hardware department now i know why BACK BITERS starting with Management how sad indeed.
bad,this is a good place to start but i would not like to stay. job security is nice.
bad,I liked learning about the major home basics.  I liked helping customers improve their homes.  I had more bullying coworkers than team mates across the board even management.  Sometimes they could be nice but not oft.  Minimal American made products.
bad,don't work at quincy  lowe's  its worst place to work at . the manager that hire me bully everybody there the other are clueless tell you how do you job but don't know how to do they
bad,Tasks are not organized. Keep around incompetent employees. Management does not handle concerns of employees well. The training is the only benefit of the workplace.
bad,"Unusually long hours and too many responsibilities, typically too many things for one person to realistically handle."
bad,There was a lot of passing the buck and hostility.  Basically they're a huge cooperation and they don't care much about the people who run their stores - employees are just a number.
bad,"Used rude comments on a daily basis, Very easy to judge someone, I loved the job I did, The management made it the hardest."
bad,"Bad scheduling, low pay and unskilled management. Not enough department managerial expertise. Workers were held to a much higher standard than supervisors were."
bad,"A lot of the management was out for themselves only.  Co-workers were pretty good for the most part."
bad,Would have been my career had I not moved to the UK. Retail managment is my preferred career choice.
bad,not a good company to work for. i would not work for them again
bad,"Typical day at work is very random at lowes. Every day is something new never constant it's a chaotic mess. What I learned is to finish school faster and get my bachelor's from working their its a dead end job you will never move up unless your part of their little group its like H.S."
bad,"I went to Lowe's with a career mindset. I was offered two jobs, one for Warehouse Team Member or Transportation Clerk. I chose Transportation thinking that's where I would fit in the most and be able to really contribute. Well everything I thought was going great, until some older co-workers found out I was in line for promotion. They didn't like the thought of working under someone younger than they were. They made up false allegations (which were never proven and dismissed) against me, and stretched the truth beyond its limits about a situation that had happened between a member of upper management and myself and another team member. They all signed written statements which was said to be all the evidence they needed since they all stated the same facts almost. I was going through the proper channels with my boss, but because he didn't have an office, and there was supposed to be an ""OPEN DOOR POLICY"" I let him know that I was not happy with the way a member of upper management had talked to us and belittled us in front of other people. So because I acknowledged and admitted that I had raised concern about that member of management to HR, I was let go as well as my boss for supposable ""Job Performance"". I was told that I didn't represent Lowe's Core Values of ""PRIDE"". Come to find out the guy who was friends of 5 years to a Coach in my department, he ended up getting the promotion of Coach for weekends with the help of his buddy. How ironic isn't it? All I can say is if you want to work with Lowe's then you better just keep your mouth shut, don't ever go to anyone about a"
bad,"I found while here, that working with a store type warehouse is not my fav. The manages were young, & need to learn more before given power to be in charge of others. I did enjoy the job, but I was always looking to better myself in other fields."
bad,"hardest part of the job is the people you work with ! "
bad,"job was fine but to little hours,would recommend for college students"
bad,"go into work and have lots of paperwork and management micro managing you, would try to focus on customer service very stressful environment"
bad,My work day was hard. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was okay. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part of my job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of my job was lunch.
bad,"the pay was good if you keep to yourself you will survive. but they expected to much especially managers who weren't even setting good examples for the employees. everyone just did their own thing, a lot of a** kissing going on, favoritism isn't even the right word to use. workers are useless, some actually did work, others just pretend to do things when managers came around. overall disliked the people, such children more like high school than a place of business. too many people thought they ran the store, when they were just regular associates."
bad,fair compainy but needs to improve on long turm employment seasonal employment is good but not fair to people
bad,"Assist customers in finding solutions "
bad,I was hired to work sesonaly  near full time. I worked 2 weeks over 35 hours then they wre cut some weeks down to 8.
bad,"The location I was at was horrible.  I worked so hard for nothing, the store manager doesn't even listen to your concerns.  Its pretty much your word against the ASM's and obviously in that case you'll never win.  "
bad,"I am a Head cashier who enjoys meeting new people and helping them with DIY projects. I oversee the cashiers to ensure all customers have a good lasting impression of Lowe's. I handle cash drawers, allow overrides, follow up with credit accounts, monitor Loss and Prevention, train and mentor all cashiers. "
bad,The managers here were cruel and spiteful of their employees. I often didn't get my breaks or any requested time off. 
bad,very demanding. work is more important than employees and famailies. Only interested in the numbers not the customers or employees.
bad,The company itself was good it was just the managment team including the store manager that needed change
bad,"I think that due to current economic issues that Lowe's likes to keep their profits higher and by doing that they cause many employee's to leave. They will reduce their payroll and have employee's working up to 12 hours.They lay off great employee's just to save their payrool instead of looking at the lasting effect on the company the individual could have. Another words they create many lost opportunities. They have a tendency to fire people realatively easily. I liked working their but their organizational culture needs to be revamped. Some stores are run by competetent individuals who care about their employee's and many that do not. It's a lot of work and the hours suck, it is retail. In general the employee's are hard workers. I liked the fact that we were able to help the consumer with all their home improvement needs. Management was a joke. I am a former Marine and I believe in being a leader. The crews I worked with were a joke. No one respected them and this caused loss of production and trust with management. I do like the benefits that Lowe's offers. I learned as a future business owner what not to ever let happen in my company. The hardest part was the inability to have teamwork. There was what I call lot's of I's. They are never happy with production. They believe that everyone that comes into the store should have spent more money and when they didn't it was the employee's fault. We were always to blame if sales were low for the day, week, month. You can't force consumers to spend money they might not have. It's like management doesn't understand any micro or macro"
bad,"6am unload new merchandise and restock/reface merchandise in lawn and garden with power equipment because no spotters needed before store opened; 7am store meeting; 715 continue stocking/facing but now with spotters if available; help customers in the department as needed. Water all plants for the remaining time.For internet fulfillment, pick orders for a few hours depending on shift time; then pack, label, and place for shipment; follow-up on missing orders or merchandise."
bad,When the economy took a downturn several years ago changes in management were not made to benefit employees.
bad,"I thought it was a fun place to work I worked hard and I didn't have a problem with it but management made my job very unsatisfying, most of their management team do not know how to treat their associates, had bad communication with their associates and the store and some were very unprofessional, but other then that I really enjoyed working for them, the associates and department supervisors made the job very enjoyable, it was a team atmosphere, we communicated just fine fine and were able to get things done."
bad,Intimidation allowed to force workers to do unsafe tasks. No set guidlines limiting the execution of unsafe tasks. Employee expressions of safety concerns will be dealt with by termination of employee under false pretenses. There is an extremely high rate of job related injuries and unjustifiable terminations.These problems are evident in the store environment. The elevated demands on the delivery department magnify these problems subjecting the drivers to precarious situations on a daily basis and cripple any chance of having a successfull delivery system.
bad,working as a team top get trucks load or unloaded and getting to work with alot of different people
bad,"Boss man has a pokerface, so you never know what mood he's in."
bad,I was a loader helping customers with purchases by either loading them into their vehicles or pulling merchandise from floor. Layed off but was a good first job.
bad,"Pulling orders,loading and unloading for customers. Lending help to other co-workers"
bad,Lowe's was also a great place to work. I was in the lawn and garden area interacting with the costumers it makes the day go great. The management was alright i can say i really didn't encounter them much. The one thing i enjoyed the most is being out side.
bad,"It's sad to see a good company fall. Over the past year it has transitioned to the Kmart model that has failed so many retailers of the past. Employees went from being respected to having commision, christmas bonus and simple pats on the back, taken away to fill the pockets of the new CEO's. Never have I seen managment ordered to ignore the complaints of employees to push profits."
bad,"Although Lowe's is a Fortune 50 Company and has a Strong presence in the Home Improvement Industry, the Corporate Structure"
bad,"i make adjustments to daily incoming purchase orders, merchandise the live nursery products and am always looking for a way to keep my garden center standing apart from the others!"
bad,"work was typically slow at the time, also had problems that were never solved after bringing them to a managers attention."
bad,"Constantly changing schedule true of most retail companies Culture of company changing rapidly. Understaffed stores making for rapidly decreasing customer service. Everything is constantly focused on The Home Depot, trying to find ways to catch up but making the same mistakes that The Home Depot was making 10 years ago. Customer focus is key word but in reality focus is only on building shareholder wealth which does not does not happen because of the lack of true customer focus. Associate on the floor has lost significance to the company. Instead of taking care of associates and creating an atmosphere of opportunity and worth for associates company has created an atmosphere of associate expendability which has an adverse affect on customer satisfaction. Management, at least at this particular store is by threat and intimidation by store manager to all lower levels including ASM's."
bad,not everyone works all the time.
bad,Receive merchandise for initial inventory. Operated fork-lift machinery to transport inventory throughout the facility.
bad,"In the store setting it was a all for one, one for all culture, a culture in which I enjoy. In the distribution center it was a definite feeling of being disposable. I learned that I definitely need to interact with people while I am working and that I enjoy the everyday change that the store brought to me. I have learned that management is a good tool to learn from and to appreciate the challenges that they have to meet on a daily basis. My co-workers and I worked well together and have become quite close. The hardest part of the job would be that I was by myself all the time, workers are not allowed to talk to one another or stop just to say ""hi"". The most enjoyable part would be that I met some amazing people that I now get to also call my friends."
bad,As a business it is not the best place to work. Lack of management skills within the lowes Supermarket company and no form of raises or appreciation.
bad,Lowe's is very organized and clean. Some managers are amazing and some are job scared so they are jerks.
bad,It was a great place to work until Lowes decided to take away commission and decided to cut down on management. It has basically become a Home depot where you have employes that are zombies that don't care about customer service or selling
bad,The company is a good place for a male but not female. THEY ARE TREATED MUCH DIFFERENTLY!
bad,did not like it.hate the company the peopleto hard of jobmanagement sucks
bad,"A typical day consist of assisting customer in making the appropriate purchases for their home or business projects. Typically I have compile a few lumber order for deliveries or ""pick-up later orders."" Other basic tasks involve loading customers' vehicles, cutting lumber to specific dimensions and helping customers choose a product for purchase."
bad,"It's Retail with co-workers who have always worked retail, so it's all about expectations. Don't get to your top pay, becuase when things slow as they did in this economy and with the company in their infinite wisdom opening two other stores in close proximitry, you could be too expensive to keep."
bad,"Good job if that's the field you want to be in. Lots of opportunities to move up in positions if you choose. Have to be in he in the ""know"" to actually get the position they usually know who there going to hire for that position we all know. Who ever works the and puts themselves in the position to be rcognized."
bad,Weekends were the best (Busy and Productive). Interactions with customers and fellow employees made the days fly by and most enjoyable. My favorite part of job was creating and implementing training programs and presenting them in my training sessions .Also the thrill of setting warranty and extension program record sales for the entire company kept me goal oriented and dedicated.to multi-tasking without missing a beat.
bad,"I believe Lowe's is a great place to work just not the location in Newberry. There are limits to advancement if you are a person of color. This is due to the location small town, small minded people. As a team leader my co-workers respected my authority, and valued my opinion. The hardest part of the job was training a new employee and watching them being promoted-promoted to a position I had been doing for six years,. The most enjoyable part was having a customer thank me because I was able to help them, and seeing them come back and say ""I was looking for you, because you know where everything is and you know your products."
bad,"LOng story short, stay on them in order to get paid. it take s about 3 weeks to get paid"
bad,Plumbing & Electrical Department Specialist & Consultant 8/2007 to 6/2010
bad,"Working for Lowes isnt bad, but the company is a great company to work for.... On the other hand the managment for the store level needs improvment. When you hire a manager that drives the store to the ground it is hard to come to work and not be thrilled to want to work for that company."
bad,"They don't really give a good way to find people to change shifts with so you can balance your work/life, HR was really stern about stupid things. The Lowe's I worked at had cashiers cleaning the bathrooms so they didn't have to pay to outsource it."
bad,i somewhat enjoyed my year plus of employment at lowes in marshall but i was told by the human relations dept. that lowes was more important than the college i was attending and that turned me off to lowes...if the hr person is a representative of lowes that is the wrong attitude to have.
bad,"Lowe's is struggling in the market and making major changes, trying to adapt to the new markets. In the process, many good and qualified associates are being let go while others exist from day to day, not knowing if their jobs will be cancelled."
bad,"I have to applaud Lowe's for their past Career growth opportunities. An employee may have started off their career as an associate loading sacks of concrete onto the back of someone's truck and over years of dedicated work and drive, are now responsible for a region's worth of store sales direction and growth."
bad,"Management is exceptionally clicky and does not understand concept of talking ""to"" associates only ""at"" associates in a demeaning manner. Store Manager just doesn't get it, and just doesn't care about his associates. Routinely tells people not to think just do."
bad,I used to love working for Lowes. Then some of the managers started doing things I feel are not right. lowes of myrtle beach will never be the same place due to the managers currently in the store.
bad,"Work with good people, you make friends, good customers. Low pay retail, benifits fair, weak managers, upper manament clueless to employees needs, good place to work if you are young or retired part time."
bad,"First of all, you need to understand this is a dangerous environment This is a turn & burn employee company! Management turnover bad! Turnover is like nothing I've ever seen."
bad,"Aucune reconnaissance, direction avec favoritisme, travail d'√©quipe m√©diocre, aucune collaboration"
bad,They dont take care of u they add more n more jobs to ur daily routine that another dept was doing till ur doing the job of 2 thats if they do will only giv a raise twice a year that isnt enough to equal to half of what any place would giv in the same time unless ur the managers pet
bad,"Company is focused on advancing to the number 1 position in Home Improvement. Company does not consider your past work experience or skills, knowledge"
bad,Consider this a temporary position.  This would be a stepping stone for someone to get temporary work experience until a better position opens outside of the sales floor or other corporate positions.
bad,"The culture at Lowe's has changed where they use to want there employees there till retirement, now they want to pay u minimum and if u don't like it they want u to leave, ok entry level position if you don't mind not having a life outside of work"
bad,"I loved my peers & customers. I found the management inconsistent & lead by favoritism & lies. I was one of three Specialists at the desk, plus the supposed supervisor. Saying that, I was at the desk 3/4 of the time by myself.  Since we were the only desk in the store that answered the phone, I got calls for all departments, Customer Service, etc.  The phone is rarely answered at Lynnwood Lowes,"
bad,Regularly have to cover two departments. Have to beg for coverage for lunch. I enjoy this type work but tough when you are by yourself. Communication lacking. Inconsistent management. New dept. manager doesn‚Äôt have a clue.
bad,The time keeping is atrocious and the costumers are mainly surly contractors. So if you like large and in in charge people that have bad peronal hygine then it's a great place to be.
bad,great place to work although the managers are a complete nightmare where tenure made them managers and not leader ship skills. other than that the customers are usually older constructions workers who will tell you about a better product know even though they've been using the same brand of whatever for the past 15 years
bad,"The location I was employed with had troubles of its own.  It seemed that the employees were not appreciated at all.  Myself, I had brought this issue up to every manager in the store with no resolution."
bad,"Rigid rules, doesn‚Äôt appreciate employees, management has its favorites, employees are click-ish, company changes its goals each year, lack of effective communication"
bad,During the 1st year it was enjoyable and easy. But as time went on the job got more and more unbearable. With less pay and more work the job just hasn't been the same.
bad,I Started in the south which was great and everything was wonderful and you felt like you were part of a family. When I moved up to Maine and joined the Auburn team it was completely different. Everyone was out for themselves and they had favorites and just seem to be like slave drivers who didn't care about employees only customers.
bad,"I feel like all your actions at Lowe's will be reactionary. They have a hard time planning for anything. Stock comes in damaged from the DC and the store won't send it back or try and claim RO's. The hours are just nuts, 6am-11pm make for painful and inhumane scheduling. High turnover is always an issue and Lowe's doesn't seem to care at all. Work-life balance is very poor."
bad,I worked in Outside Lawn and Garden. We were self supervised for the most part. Most of my Co-workers were great. Two managers were a real PILL. The rest were great. The Store manager was awesome.
bad,"I was hired for seasonal, and got kept on for three more months, and the manager said that I may get the permanent job of being a cashier. The hourly wage is good started at $13.46, however they always made me return the next morning after closing the night before. Sometimes, I would have to be back less than 7 hours between, which I am pretty sure that is illegal... They recently got a new store manager who randomly started firing 20-30 people without notice, which is horrible because some people have families to support! After letting go all their employees, people started quitting because of how little coverage there was at work. It was so selfish of the new store manager because she fired all these people just so she could get a big fat bonus, while their remaining of their employees got a 1% raise and had to cover 2-3 departments. The management at Lowe's was horrible because if you call out, you get on their bad side right away and they always have attitudes when customers are being jerks, and sometimes take it out on their employees. Work here if you want to be paid over minimum wage, but at the same time, this is not a very fun environment to work at. Working at Lowe's was really boring and slow and the customers, contractors, and managers always acted like they were superior to you. It is ridiculous."
bad,"After arrival of new CEO, many departments were dismantled, many lay offs,Full timers no longer get 1 wknd off a month, now only 1 wknd off every 2 months no longer have 2 days off in a row. Horrible."
bad,Black and White thing exist especially in ky. You can work nights give your weekend to them work overtime still don't get the right pay for all your hard work that's why they stay hiring for summer break because only the college kids work there for the summer then they need help again
bad,"Lowe's is a large home improvement retail store located in Dublin, CA. The environment was fast paced and busy with lots of training and cross training."
bad,When I started working at Lowes it was a great place to work. New CEO is ruining the company and atmosphere in the stores.. One of the reasons after 20 years I no longer work there.
bad,"Retail has suffered greatly over the last 5 years. Staff has been reduced"
bad,After a year working at lowes the managment is not like they was they got terrible and make It hard to work for them Lowes isn't a bad company it's the managers.
bad,"Lowes was once a great company to work for. They cared about their customers and their employees. Up until 2 years ago, the only concern is the bottom line. And while I understand that's what keeps the company going, they should have never lost focus on who actually drives the business to meet their goals."
bad,"Great benefits, decent pay. Horrible ethics. Horrible management. No feedback unless it‚Äôs negative after your first 6 months on the job. Starts out great, ends ugly."
bad,Hours are very inconsistent. Management is stressed out all the time. Unreliable. They don‚Äôt follow through on scheduled availability that they insist you update constantly because they don‚Äôt pay attention to it.
bad,Good luck trying to get a job here if you ain‚Äôt white! They‚Äôre super racist and ain‚Äôt afraid to show it and the funny thing about it is there CEO is a black guy to bad he didn‚Äôt know about how this store really is! Thank God I don‚Äôt work there anymore
bad,"1st 2 years it was great place,  good people,  then corporate changes happened, new management. Managers mow do nothing,  and don't expect to get trained, regardless of position you are hired for."
bad,"Lowe's in Alaska is kind of in an uproar lately. Just like with Walgreens, I think Lowe's also has the potential to be a great company to work for. I believe there was a serious lack of training in the Anchorage locations and very inconsistent management."
bad,"Management is poor, very high stress, over used, moderate pay, below fair advancement, good training, easy to be terminated,  more complaints than compliments,  don't reveal everything you know"
bad,"Great place to work, management is no where to be found when needed, favoritisms is at its all time high within the company. No communication. Lots of changes."
bad,EXTREMELY understaffed. Everyone‚Äôs job is 10 times harder than it needs to be because it seems like they rarely hire new people. Management is poor and doesn‚Äôt know what is going on half of the time. The head cashiers are great though and I worked with some really awesome people. Decent pay & benefits.
bad,"In the last couple years of ‚Äúcompany growth‚Äù it has cut management, and it will soon eliminate specialists which means no matter your skill set you will be treated like an entry level associate. Sad that knowledgeable associates are not appropriated the way they should be."
bad,Not as much of a team based atmosphere as it is a work based atmosphere. That can be great for many people but if you're more personable and like communication then consider a different job.
bad,"It has gone down hill slowly and in spurts over the last 8 years, pay, benefits, responsibility, lack of training for new positions, high turn over all negative experiences now with this company I believed in for so many years."
bad,Favoritism prevailed among management. I was hired for my experience but not allowed to do the job according to my experience. Employee guidelines are not posted.
bad,"Overall, I like working at Lowes.  Friendly and capable associsates.  However, corporate policies are increasingly infringing on employees consideration and trust.  Morale is declining quite rapidly."
bad,"Like the title says, compensation was good, for a retail job, but management doesn't care about anything else but themselves. Have an idea that might make things run more smoothly? Oh well! Better keep it to yourself! Have a problem with another associate? Oh well! Better keep quiet or you'll be in the hot seat."
bad,"didn't care for the policy's at lowes , very inconsistent, and schedules vary from day to night through the week, then cooperate dictated me to work nights. I felt over worked as I covered several different departments. I quit"
bad,"It''s retail, hours are terrible, pay is ok, management is poor.  Corporate offices need to spend more time in the stores before they create their crazy programs"
bad,"This was a solid job for a while; decent pay, good people to work with, I even learned a little bit while working there; but with the skeleton crew that this store has now there's next to no way to get anything done properly and in my experience most of the customers just end up leaving more mad than satisfied"
bad,Store has had more changes than the current structure can deal with. Company is do for a restructure. Very outdated systems. Excellent customer service is hard to achieve with the lack of backing. Labor hours cut too short.
bad,Company was great I loved the people I worked with only down fall was I applied to move up as manger 4 times and was told 4 different stupid reasons why I couldn‚Äôt move up. They ended u giving the job to my cousin....
bad,"Lowes is a well established company, for its broad benefits, but the managers of the various stores and their teams of assistants do not ensure your welfare as an employee, they are only worried about sales and their commissions, the lowes corporation makes cruel decisions to fire thousands of employees just for eliminating a job position and it doesn't matter to hundreds of families that left without a job is really an inhuman policy."
bad,If they followed corporate policy.  I would still work for them. But corporate doesnt care if the policy they set up isn't followed. Just as long if the store is making money.
bad,"position has gotten more difficult.  Less advantages to working there.  No work life balance, hours are really difficult. no guaranteed days off.  only 6 weekends off a year."
bad,"Busy days open seven days a week with long hours of operations.   "
bad,Company does not value its employees. Managers tend to be ignorant in all departments and are only on the floor to discipline or because a big wig is coming.
bad,"I have been at Lowes for about six months.  Currently the store is getting rid of full time positions in leu of part time.  Basically, you do the same work for less pay and no benefits.  They also run on a skeleton crew most days, with one person running several departments.  Even though they admit that they are short on workers, they still demand that everything get done and that every customer is helped.  When one person runs 3 departments, how are they supposed to help every customer, and finish all required work?  Management doesn't care, insisting that everyone has to just buckle down and do it.  I have a full time job, but everyone in receiving is getting demoted to part time, so my days are numbered.  They don't give you any warning.  Not a nice place to work right now."
bad,"Management is horrible, they give hardly any paid time off and you are very limited on when you are allowed to take the time off that you have. Scheduling is a nightmare, part time employees are not guaranteed any hours and hours will vary from around 8-10 one week and jump up to around 35 the next. Employee's are treated like dirt and they work a skeleton crew all the time."
bad,No start meeting. When I started as a cashier everyone was friendly and helpful. After I went to the garden center the supervisor was under friendly and unprofessional. Constantly criticizing until the end.I learned to run the cash register. The most enjoyable experience was the people that I met. Enjoyed learning about the plants.
bad,"The time it took to get hired. Makes me think they should rethink how they hire people! Also they grossly underpay anyone who's not in management!"
bad,"The job is fun, I design kitchens and have worked garden center and appliances.  The pay is terrible for the amount of responsibility we carry.  The work hours are horrible for family life.  I appreciate that it‚Äôs retail, but understaffing is a problem, work schedule is atrocious.  Look around you, most employees are divorced, young singles or struggling.  Just give the employees a definite work schedule and stick to it.  Every week it‚Äôs different, which plays havoc with having a family.  Some people like working early days, some late nights, so have those people work those shifts.  The computer systems are the worst.  They do not provide a living wage."
bad,This store is completely mis-managed and under-staffed. Store manager is awful. Most managers are awful.  Dept managers and workers are not supported.
bad,"You are treated very poorly overall at Lowe's there are a couple exceptions to this as always, but from my experience the managers only care the job gets done, they aren't concerned about the safety of there employee's. They regularly gave me 100lb+ items to lift and load by myself. The most they ever gave me was 210lbs, and when I called my manager for assistance he took 15 minutes to get over to me and help and by that time I had already put it in cause the customer couldn't wait any longer."
bad,Management was horrible. Work culture participated in discrimination. The job itself is easy but management definitely would promote on favoritism instead of merit
bad,"Management likes to keep things secret way to much until it happens, which gives no one time to prepare, some management is fine, others are extremely poor"
bad,"This place is extremely stressful to work at. You get yelled at by anyone and everyone (customers mostly) but even if the customer isn‚Äôt in the right then your manager still yells at you. So much drama, it‚Äôs like high school all over again. I worked there from 2008-2018 and I switched stores 7 times due to another advancement in my career. I would‚Äôve loved to stay there but it was getting to where my work life was coming home with me and it was not fair. This place has new HR system that is ludicrous"
bad,"The money is great yet the environment is TERRIBLE!! All employees are stressed out all of the time. If you are great at your job it goes in noticed, if you slack on your job and but flirt with the Sups, then your occurrences will be removed"
bad,The new CEO has cut numerous positions that had only recently been created by him and gave no notice or real compensation other than two weeks severance. Associates of all levels fear for their positions and livelihoods due to these flippant decisions. Despite having just been promoted I see the writing on the wall and dont want to live in fear of being laid off with no opportunity to transition into another role
bad,I loved working at Lowe's I loved the people and the daytime hours it's actually a good place to work but you gotta do what the store policy is I love to go to work at Lowe's. I loved the customers it was a very good place to work
bad,Senior management is horrible. You're just a number is their eyes as well as corporates. They eliminate positions with no warning or care as to how long you've been there or how well you've done your job. Very uncaring company.
bad,Each store varies on how good of a work place it is.  Lowe's at cooperate level does not care about there employees at the store level.  The benefits are good but the vacation times takes a while to build up.  The management is lazy and all they want to do is delegate  what the store manager ask them to do and when you ask for help from the managers it is very unlikely you will receive it.
bad,Terrible management. Coworkers didn‚Äôt do their job or show up on time because there weren‚Äôt any consequences. All the work was left to the couple people that actually wanted to help the customers.
bad,"Everyone is constantly asked to do more and more so the company can cut labor costs and save profits, which are not passed on in a way that rewards the few people that bust their bottoms to keep the store running smooth."
bad,"Under the new CEO, this place is going downhill like an avalanche. They're dumping all non-customer handling associates with no notice and exporting their roles to 3rd party companies. Delivery, PSA, FSA, Assembly, and Stocking are all going or already gone."
bad,"Lowes has experienced several changes and is moving towards a different direction than my career goals. Through a new CEO, restructuring, and lack of support from managers, I feel as though I am not being utilized to the best of my abilities."
bad,Way to much change and turnover.  They are trying to add online/ delivery and copy Home Depot at the same time.  Too much instability and poor management.
bad,"I work with many great people. Coworkers, managers, etc. Store manager not being one of them. People are taken for granted, mistreated, and and misunderstood by the main store manager. If you want to work somewhere where you‚Äôre held accountable for others actions, a place where your concerns and beckoning for help will be ignored and disregarded, Lowe‚Äôs is the place for you."
bad,"I worked for 4 years for Lowes in a different state and absolutely loved it.  Since I have transferred to a Texas Lowes, management is absolutely horrific!  It is a nightmare.  It all depends on the store you get to how you will be treated and how much you will enjoy the job. We also just got a new CEO and he is horrible.  He is not making smart moves for the company and I fear everyday my store will close because it is not making enough money.  They fired 3 people in 1 day.  It is a very iffy thing there now."
bad,Lowes like many other retailers only hires part-time. Dealing with the caliber of Port Charlotte customers was my most difficult in my 30 years of retail.
bad,The job wasn't bad but Management was very poor. Often have to do the work of 3-4 people but without the pay for that type of workload. Employees are like a revolving door due to poor management and pay. Morale is very low.
bad,My time with lowe's was amazing until the last year. Corporate structural changes made everyone's life from District Manager down to hourly employees life high stressed and no work life balance.
bad,"Look else were for a job. The GM is arrogant, and walks around like he owns the place. Everybody is out for themselves. If your new at the job, you will not get help. I learned the job on my own. It got worse the longer I was there."
bad,This job was stressful. The manager was stressful. Things were very disorganized and there was no real structure. There was a lot of just chaos surrounding working there.
bad,this job was laid back and cool because we worked at our own pace and the customers were very nice and we never really overworked because the employees worked as a team
bad,Lowes as a whole is an okay place to work could be better they like to change schedules and not tell you and the management there is very poor and the dont really know what they are doing
bad,"No overtime, too much drama, poor management, no communication. They only promote who they want in different departments. You have to kiss up to management to get the job you want."
bad,"Lowes is fun for the winter months, but when district managers come in and during the summer this job sucks. The managers take everything out on the employees and they arn't very nice. Employees get yelled at a lot. Its a very stressful place to work"
bad,Used to ne a great place to work for and now it's all going down hill from there always gotta watch your back poor management lack of teamwork and no one held accountable for their  actions
bad,Worked at my current location for about 4 months now but I am a returning employee. I have worked there previous and transferred to another location for family reasons. I moved back to my current location due to personal issues and expected to be hired back to my old position. I was instead hired in as a seasonal worker. Disappointed but didn't let it bother me. Employees are bend to every customer's whim and those who don't usually have to bring a manager into the argument to get the customer to understand the reasons why their request is not possible. Many customers are rude and obnoxious but management does not defend its employees from these types of customers. It's hard to put a smile on your face when you know that management would rather step on you to appease customers than tell them they are out of line and need to leave.
bad,"New employees get paid more than employees who have been there for years because they don‚Äôt increase your pay rate. You have no say in your scheduling shifts if full time, (mostly closing shifts2p-11p) very short staffed. Don‚Äôt recommend getting a job here"
bad,Be ready to open a book and write check marks on a page. Not much room for out of the book thinking. If just following directions is for you then go for it.
bad,The management at some stores is like being in high school were there are the golden team members and those that get all the hard stuff thrown their way.  Managers play favorites and when called out on it they retaliate in ways that they will not get caught but make the workers life miserable.  Delivery drivers were given short notice on company going 3rd party and losing their jobs.  Proving the company does not care for the employees or the bind they put on the families.
bad,Everyday is different. I have been there for 5 years now and I loved the first couple of years a ton. Now the company has been eating away at me and has drove me to want to quit and search for another job.
bad,"The people you work with are nice,and keep it fun and light. But the retail grind and rude people will take all the fun out of the job .and don't get me started on cart pushing,how Lowe's doesn't have an electronic cart pushed is just another cheap move from Lowe's."
bad,"It's not for everyone - try for yourself & see! Scheduling is made by a computer that forces employees to work 9-10 hour shifts on week-ends, which sometimes falls on their 6th day of work. Doubt the designers have ever actually had to work it to know what it's like."
bad,if you like putting in hours and not getting the recognition you deserve please apply. Upper management hide in offices while department supervisors are forced to do upper management‚Äôs jobs as well as their own. Hours change daily so you don‚Äôt have much of a sleep schedule. Many times you will go long stretches on late shifts making it extremely difficult to spend time with your families. Not much of a life outside of work.
bad,"I came from a OTR driving job to work closer to home and be closer to my aging grandparents.  It's been 3 years as a CDL driver with them and I've learned that caring managers that actually do anything to help you is few and far.   After 2 years of running and average of 60-70 hours while destroying your body and 1 year of part time which I still do over 40 hours in 3 days (which is complete insanity)  I still hardly have time to spend any time with my family.  "
bad,lowes offers a decent wage for job description. Management is often an issue at many stores. corporate decisions are not based on what is actually needed in each store they are totally profit orientated which actually causes them to loose money in the long run. Its why they have to keep redoing their company goals so often.
bad,"I didn't care for the management at the location I worked for. The store manager is not approachable and that made the environment uncomfortable. The ASM that took over the front end is a know it all, been doing this for 25 years is her favorite line, and she came to work for Lowe's and made the front end worse with her attitude against her subordinates. "
bad,"Physically demanding job, if you do your job. Very little opportunity for growth.  Near impossible to get a full time position.  Morale among employees is low."
bad,"Lowe's was lacking in management support under the new management. ASM's remained in back of store while Head Cashiers needed assistance with mgmt calls. "
bad,"Very stressful wondering who will be your supervisor for your shift, I learned a lot having to get a lot of ""unnecessary lectures"" like a five year old. Management was okay, never was on a personal level. The hardest part of my job was not knowing what was right from wrong meaning, they're too many head cashiers telling you different things and how my job should be done, with not enough training to have known what was expected. Very confusing to say the least. Schedules were changed practically every other day, with changes of days off/hours with no warnings. I could never plan a doctors appointment etc. Very unpleasant place to work. I tried to stay positive for as long as I could. Help is very much needed there."
bad,"Management at Lowe's made it difficult to do your job consistently and correctly. As employees we were expected to follow policies and procedures. However, management would make us ignore those policies and procedures to accommodate the customers. This made us look unknowledgeable as employees. This made my time at Lowe's very unenjoyable. My co-workers were great, management not so much."
bad,If you are part time you must have open availability during the weekend. You can never have entire weekend off even if you have vacation time available.
bad,"Long Hours, dirty work, but that's what the business calls for. No support from Management when trying to solve a problem above your pay level."
bad,"Management constantly changing. very inconsistent work environment. Lowes provided no heads up letting the employees know we would be closing at our location, only gave us a 26 day notice."
bad,Most of the managers don't know what they're doing. Very friendly employees and normally nice customers. Saturdays are very hectic and very stressful.
bad,It started off fine. As of 2019 a new scheduling structure is being rolled out. It's not worth the loss of work life balance for the higher pay compared to other retail positions.
bad,"High accident rates, misleading pay, voluntary time off means high turnover. "
bad,The management team at store 0579-Morristown tn. Is like working at a frat house environment. The management is always hiding until the time corporate shows up.the environment by management is you have to kiss their butt in order to have a stress free work environment. Under the new management they have fired or ran off over 100 employees. Their is inappropriate behavior between the manager and HR.
bad,"Working at Lowe's was very fast paced in the mornings, slower in the afternoon and again fast paced in the evenings. The day started out with re-stocking the shelves from the previous evenings deliveries. Then when completed you were to bring down the overstock from up in the steel and fill in any product holes on the sales floor. This work was done at the same time as servicing the customers that came into your department."
bad,"The Northridge store is a very busy store. I work in the paint department. A typical day is helping customers choose colors, mixing paint for them, and assisting managers with other tasks."
bad,"Lowes has added multiple management positions, that all can make changes without giving any reason at all behind them and without going through the proper channels. The company make constant attempts at making the workplace unnecessarily stressful for people with multiple years at the company. The pay is not even close to competitive."
bad,great temp job not for career advancement. I learned that it was a fast paced environment and diversity while encouraged was not respected.  Would recommend as a learning job only
bad,The only chance for advancement depends on how many friends you have there it‚Äôs high school all over some employees made racist comments others were busy hurting others to benefit there own advancement
bad,Whenever managers see you talking they provide things for you to do.  Even when you are a good worker.  Communication is very poor.  Regulations passed down are constantly being changed by management.
bad,"I loved my position with Lowe's; however, after many reorganizations, I fell into a situation where I was transferred to a department that were restructuring responsibilities.  I was outsourced to a 3rd party with no offer of placing me elsewhere.  After many years of service, no offer of another role within the company was devastating."
bad,"Very little upper management follow thru.  Store manager only wanted to ""fly under the radar.""   Did not hold his own managers accountable.   Avoided confrontation and turned away when faced with difficult decisions."
bad,"Depending on PT or FT you‚Äôll get either an decent experience or completely screwed PT get anywhere from 15 to the 39 hours and they mention overtime but I promise you you‚Äôll NEVER get it they cut you off at the 39 and send you home instead , they mention careers but at the end of the day it‚Äôs walmart without the dead expressions retails retail, very demanding as well depending on your department and manager some will work you to the bone physically and mentally which you‚Äôll think isn‚Äôt a thing sometimes but when you have to leave at 9:30pm and come back at 5:30am you‚Äôll really feel it also they still use the really dumb mentality of ‚Äúif your sitting your not working‚Äù so if your not ready to be on your feet moving for 8 hours the job isn‚Äôt for you seriously work anywhere but retail"
bad,"I enjoy the benefits and some of the persons I have worked with prior, however, am not pleased with the management. There is nothing further that I want to discuss."
bad,"The last two managers I had were great, but moved departments, now management is stupid because all decisions made have cost us much time and store space."
bad,"Very stressful work environment. Upper management screams, hangs up the phone on you. They do it to everyone in the market area.  There is no accountability for the upper management.  They can treat you any way they want."
bad,First perform a morning business meeting w/ store associates going over previous days sales/ safety concerns and recognize at least one associate who something great. Walk store and ensure freight was stocked. One day would prepare for weekly sales meeting and go over info needed in associate advancement training.
bad,"interesting way to work many changes have been made to improve the workplace we will see how they pan out. I""m not one for giving all this information I worked there in 2016 had many physical limitations, but still had to work just as hard as a healthy person I was not asking for special treatment.  I am a hard worker, even though I may have limitations, but there was no looking out for the people that needed it.  I learned how to drive fork lift The culture was not very conducive to many employees.  they were all about they're own need and want I don't know what its like now but I believe it has not changed much.  most enjoyable part getting out at a decent time during the day. I do not have much more to say it was a short live time for me so here goes.  I am a hard worker"
bad,"Time Management strictly enforced, good location from home, enjoy completing planograms and resets worked in stressful situations. reset endcaps, move beams and bays according to store layouts"
bad,"Most of the managers are not experienced with working the floor so they look flummoxed whenever you try to explain to them why you are behind. I was told to downstock certain product but it's impossible to do because you work IRP till 10AM then from 10AM - 2PM you can't do any task based work and you're getting off at 2:30PM, so they work never gets done. And if you're closing forget about getting any worklists done because they is bare minimum coverage. "
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. Knowing that I was able to help their day, or was able to encourage them to fix home related problems meant a great deal to me. Building relationships and trust with customers is something I strive for on a daily basis."
bad,"Lowe's is one of those places that sounds nice, looks nice, but when you get there it's not as it seems. Lowe's is completely unstable, confusing, and a place you never know what's going to happen next. Poor communication, poor planning (marketing), and lack of staffing, stock, and solutions make me feel as if Lowe's will be the next Circuit City or Sears.  "
bad,If you like call centers go for it but there is a high turnover rate and lots of rules. Lots of different shifts available. The cafeteria has good food.
bad,"The set up a program that did not work and ended up restructuring it. It is the good old boy system, so keep your head down. Most of the managers are great you just have to watch a few of them."
bad,"I loved my job. Was head cashier. Received a phone call from do they said, the corporate office. I did what they said. Turned out to be scam. Was told all was okay and not to worry. Two weeks later they fired me when I went into work. Nothing on my record till that day. A manager who also was involved still works there. I don't believe that is very fair"
bad,"Work schedule is random or on a rotation . Typically I would come in and stock shelves with product , move product with pallet jacks or fork lift. "
bad,"Work place okay, but scheduling made it hard to plan personal life around the schedule. The scheduling varied during each week. The posted schedule may change daily."
bad,Registers are rather easy to run once you get the hang of it. The managers are what could make you think twice about staying there once you get to know them.
bad,"They expect a lot with little pay.  Shifts were often under staffed creating more stress on staff and a poor shopping experience for customers.  There was an option to be trained in fork lift operation which made you a more versatile employee for scheduling.  However, you did not receive any additional pay for completing training.  I was promoted without an increase in pay which ultimately led me to leave the company."
bad,The jobs are physical but not demanding. The hours are long but not unbearable. All around and only just average job.would not reccomend to friend due to how disorganized they are
bad,The job as okay it was laid back and easy . i was an cashier . the people where okay and the management was decent. The hours where decent could have been more but overall i loved the job
bad,"The Lowe's district that I worked in has a notoriously high turnover rate at all levels of store positions. Employees that managed to handle the constant infighting and backstabbing long enough to make it to a management or supervisory role were immediately under the gun, as if the company was immediately looking for any reason to get rid of them. Absolutely a place where being a suck-up will get someone further than being a capable employee."
bad,"Most people are just moving along with their day and that would be fine. Except that almost everyday, you'll have at least one customer or more who is an absolute toss pot."
bad,"Especially at my location #754 Lowe's ""The Rock"", it can sometimes be stressful and tiresome. The only thing that's still keeping me there are my co-workers.  Everything else is not even worth it, trust me. It was good at first then, later on, you start to realize management is terrible it's only one or two good managers there, but other than that you are on your own."
bad,"If you want to learn there are associates that love to teach. If you want to slack off there are managers that let it happen. If you work delivery, the store expects your life devotion to it. Most enjoyable part of working at my Lowes store was the diversity. Most everyone got along, and if you had a positive attitude you could learn alot about others and what they do for Lowes."
bad,"I found that the store was always understaffed, I also felt like there were too many managers and I was always referred to another whenever I would ask a question. I took the job as a temporary and part time 2nd job, but found they didn't listen to my hour needs. "
bad,"Management  is horrible there, they don't know how to talk to people, don't help u at all. Very low on staff and they want u to do everything even if you by yourself"
bad,"Lowe's will work you until 12am and have you come back at 5:30am. Management is favoritism, benefits are for full times only, good school job I guess."
bad,fast paced stressful environment. It is a very cut throat place to work. I had to leave due to the drastic hours back and forth. also my manager commited suicide and it was to hard to get over him being gone as he was a life long friend
bad,"I enjoy working at lowes, but ive had many issues with it since my time of being hired. At first, it was wonderful, i did my job, i was payed every two weeks, my hours were really nice. Over time i my hours were cut and i was relocated to another section of the store, till eventually i was in a stressful position where i could barely pay my bills. For me it is still this way, and any time i reach out and explain my situation to my managers i never recieve any help."
bad,Not a good place to work unless you are part of the chosen favorites. Would be a good place to work if HR didn't give all of the positions and opportunities to there favorites.
bad,"I loaded cars for customers who need assistance "
bad,i had fun working there. There we had a safe and clean envoiment and the the bosses was always check on the employees and always took care of things that was wrong
bad,"There is no structure or organization. The hard working dedicated employers who show up and perform professionally they are the ones who carry, clean, and organize the building, and the managers always depend on those people."
bad,"Only good thing about the job is the people you work with.      Management treats employees however they want and if you don't like it you can leave.     Management destroyed the Lowes that I worked for.     I went from having a job I actually enjoyed waking up and going to, to having a job I completely hated."
bad,Over promises and under delivers on every expectation. Shows extreme favoritism towards select employees.  Seems to make up policies and daily plans on a regular.
bad,"Because of my position I only am able to direct where items are but never trained on or provided any knowledge of products, just pull in carts from lot"
bad,Definitely one of those businesses thats a stepping stone to something much better at a later time down the road. Unfortunately mediocre management decisions and people create an environment that leads to poor execution from the top that trickles down.
bad,"Worst scheduling imaginable"
bad,"Management is trash"
bad,"Most of the jobs offered are part-time which is good if you need flexible hours for school or another job. Limited growth opportunities, and pay raises are non-existent or very small. They work with limited staff which seems stretched thin every day. I really feel sorry for the full-timers who have to perform many of management's duties because of the lack of management coverage. The store I work at is generally rated very low on their EOS surveys, and would do a lot worse if a lot of the employees even cared about filling them out."
bad,"During my time there the management had ideas of what jobs were prioritized and what wasn't, but that depended on the manager of the day. Rotating between 3 and 1 boss boss. This created confusion on certain tasks and how they got done. Overall not a good experience for me."
bad,I feel at lowes that you have to have a good team to run the store the way it need to be because if you dont have a team you dont have anything. You have to be a people person to work with customers
bad,Is a decent place to work but they do not care about how long you‚Äôve been there or how good of job you do. You can be replaced is how they see people. They don‚Äôt generally care about employees
bad,Most managers and even most of the workers are lazy and unwilling to actually work for their wages. my manager walks off when his workers need him - if/when he shows up - and very rarely even does what the job entails. Hardworkers get shafted and the lazy ones get the biggest raises.
bad,"Lowes co-workers were very nice and helpful. The training and meetings were informative, but their hiring procedures for advancement in job opening within the company had nothing to do with you already in Lowes,  They had to have at least 3 applications per any job opening to schedule a interview with HR.  They did not hire for advance openings within their company."
bad,"Not a good or professional work enviorment. The Management does not care for their employees, they care about the number of boxes that go through the warehouse on a daily basis."
bad,It was okay not the best place for someone unfamiliar with warehouse or FDC . You will get a good work out everyday every week everything is heavy.You will earn some fork lift stand on pallet jack experience.
bad,"When I started working at Lowe's as a cashier everything started out fine. I got my lunch breaks and my other breaks. The moment I moved out onto the floor I started losing those paid privileges. I wasn't getting my lunch breaks and it was affecting me. Another thing that wasn't working out for me was when managers didn't communicate with each other and different tasks were prioritized differently. Having to work shifts that never seemed to line up screwed with my sleep schedule, and I know that there were full time associates that had a fixed schedule. I asked for one and never got one. I would continually have schedules that were 9-6 one day 12:30 to 9:30 the next day and then have to open the next day. My body couldn't take it. I need a semi set schedule. Another thing that kept happening with the schedule was management would change the schedule last minute without notifying me. We had a store email that we received notifications on, but we can't access the email from home. They have all our numbers, but never called us or even talked to us previously at work to get permission to change our schedules.   I also found myself getting reprimanded for not getting my tasks done in an orderly fashion because I got caught up with customers and helping them, which is what my main job is, or because I was helping a fellow associate. My manager would get upset at this and no matter if I stated my case, I was always in the wrong. Truth be told I wouldn't recommend anyone work at Lowe's of Brookings."
bad,"Restructured in-store management team in January 2017, interviews were held in store and sent to cooperate. Picked the worst people possible. Very poor management since then with little training for new managers. "
bad,Nobody cared how we were all treated by the team lead. She was out of her mind and i believe management  knew but they didn't care. She would tell us personal situations about herself that none of us men should of known about....very self centered women.
bad,"A dying island that's increasingly under threat from new, emergent forces in retail; forces that are collectively destined to usurp the organization's prominence in the market with time. Those who retain the reins of power across the organization are ill-equipped and unprepared to confront the growing list of unwelcomed realities that face the organization's future prospects."
bad,"Anytime it was a staffs birthday, or celebrating annual accomplishments, there was always food in the lunch room. However, you always worked longer hours than scheduled, with absolutely no added benefits"
bad,typical day included learning a new online system. answering phones taking care of customer issues and helping with a better shopping experience. Assisting with taking phone orders.
bad,"People would leave the job for hours at a time and management was never around to notice, people would hang out and not work at all, the work culture was just horrible"
bad,"A typical day at work as a Customer Service Associate/Cashier is being in the same small area standing and scanning items for customers. During this time you'll experience no customers at all and then 20 of them appear at once. Your coworkers will get stuck on one and the backup you called for will be ignored until the line gets to a manageable level. Not really ignored but we have nowhere to pull another cashier from and the managers don't want to help. The floor associates don't want to help either as you beg for a backup loader to help. During your shift you'll want a break from everything however when you ask for one you'll get the ""you're not entitled to a break in Missouri"" or ""I didn't even get a break"" so you'll have to just wait. Restroom breaks are mandatory so that's nice. Lunches are scattered between too early and too late in the work shift. "
bad,"The management at the location I worked for had no professionalism. I have worked for many companies and this was the  worst experience of my working life. There was no understanding, no teamwork, no communication, poor training, poor coaching,  unfair treatment and unfair pay scale, always felt uncomfortable, never felt welcomed, don't care about your health issues. Very stressful place to work for. The managers play favorites way to much and make fun of the customers to their face. The company constantly layoffs its older workers. They do not appreciate the years associate have given the company. Advancement at my location was very, very poor. Employees and Managers constantly backstab with each other. The health insurance could be a little better. The company did provide free food on special occasions."
bad,"Lowe's is a good place to work while in school, or as a filler job. The pay is good and the health insurance is decent. I do not recommend working at Lowes long term, there is no room for growth and positions are given because of who you know, not by experience or worth ethic."
bad,"Most young people working at Lowe‚Äôs are on there cell phones constantly, and Lowe‚Äôs gives them a pass. They just say they were in a different department helping a customer.  The General Manager promised me a raise so I went to work nights and busted my but to reorganize the back of store ‚Äú bullpen‚Äù and when it came time for the raise I did not receive it.  He gave me a poor excuse."
bad,"Training class was huge, everything was online and repetitive.  There was about 40 people to a trainer, who didn't do anything.  Manager micromanaged after every call and never had anything positive to say.  Every call was someone yelling and i mean yelling that their machines are down."
bad,No set schedule. You don't know if you're going to have the same schedule from one week to the next. In the store the managers sit in the back and talk. Rarely are they upfront. Call-offs leave you trying to balance an entire section by yourself. There's an incredible amount of favoritism. No life outside of work due to the lack of schedule. The pay is a joke for as much as you're asked to do. Would be great for a high school student or part time. Not recommended for full time.
bad,"The most difficult part of this workplace is the confusion and lack of direction/training that is given to support and assistant managers that are supposed to lead staff. No one takes responsibility for anything and they pass things off to other managers who pass it off again. Crucial decisions are not made due to fear of being held accountable, lack of training, and an already overwhelming mountain of corporate issued tasks and paperwork to get through off the floor."
bad,hardworkers get overlooked. some part time employees work hard than full time employees. its unfair that part time benefits doesnt cover as much as full time does
bad,"Best part of my job was building and maintaining  customer relationships and learning new skills. The worse part is poor management, which  makes it hard to provide quality customer service."
bad,Lowe‚Äôs is a flexible and good company to start off if you are looking for a good part time paid job. What really lacks in advancement is the management .
bad,"Lowe's has a history of being employee friendly.  That changed when they decided to go after the Home Depot business.  Although they pay well for retail, the hours are odd, you have to be available for all shifts and the employee turnover is high.  Management comes and goes, training is weak and you feel like you are just there to wear their red vest."
bad,There is no security.  Lack of Management encouraging employees to communicate.  I used to love to work there and over the past 2 years there it was hard to love it when there was always so much change in direction.
bad,"The HR is a joke and the management has zero educational background. Therefore, they lack in management skills. The store manager doesn't care about anything other than sales. They will not fire the people that make sales, even though they are actually costing them money in returns/refunds. They hire the worst people and keep them!! They don't fire anyone, so if you want job security, this job is for you. They are unprofessional 99% of the time. You will get no support from upper management with issues, and they lack training. You will go through an online course when you first get hired, just to learn everything that you don't need to know about the department. If you don't believe any of this, just look at our Yelp reviews."
bad,"Got yelled at by customers when I worked in lawn and garden, and could not answer a question about products on the other side of the store that I had nothing to do with. Managers made me to mundane tasks to pass the time and to make them feel like they had power when they did little to nothing to help."
bad,Rate of pay is poor. Don't even think about moving up in this company because it'll never happen. They have there favorites and if your not one of them you will never move up in the company.
bad,"Time's are changing and Amazon is taking over."
bad,"Your schedule will be ALL over the map - from 5:30 am to 11:30 pm, ALL holidays and weekends (generally). Forget any work/life balance. Management is a revolving door - in general. Beware of certain departments unless you seriously love heavy manual labor."
bad,"At first, this job was incredible. But the longer the store has been open, the worse the management has gotten. There are great concepts in place here, but they are all lost without meaning because the people that were put in place to make these concepts great simply do not care. Employees are treated like work-horses and expected to do the impossible without ever working overtime. Hours are cut to the point where departments cannot properly function, and we have lost MANY customers as a result. I will say that the best part of the job is that my creativity has been able to flourish in a way that other businesses would prevent. However, I would NOT recommend this job to anyone simply because the environment created by management is toxic, full of back-stabbing and childish behavior."
bad,"Ok place to work very stressful, wouldn't advise anyone to work here unless you like doing the work of 5 people and getting yelled at for not completing work, while management favorites can do no wrong"
bad,"My day consists of waking up in the morning stressed out, getting dressed, hopping into my car and driving to work only to be stressed out the moment I clock in"
bad,"I was in charge of tending to the outside plants, stocking items, and loading customer's purchases. often watering plants early in the morning. even getting a 11 pm closing schedule and the next morning 5:30 am opening."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of picking and pulling daily customer special orders and assembling product by given deadline. Shipping and recieving product on a daily basis as well and stocking merchandise.
bad,Hours will get to you and the management is not very great. Some of the people you wouk with have very bad demeniers and you will be over worked / overwhelmed from time to time.
bad,"Early morning start times (4 am), very task oriented.  Hardest part of job was not having enough time or opportunities to complete daily/weekly tasks."
bad,the work culture is very territorial when you start in the sells position you are expected to perform in a partial stock persons roll. not productive.
bad,"Understaffed, rarely worked with you, managers hate confrontation, some of the workers are rude, they hardly worked with you, almost every single day was a stressful work day."
bad,Do not recommend this establishment to anyone.  Very unprofessional work place. Employees seemed to love starting drama amoungst themselves more than actually doing their work.
bad,"Management at store level lacking.  When Lowes restructured due to serious financial issues, all dept mgrs. and ASM's were either demoted or fired.  No advancement opportunities at all"
bad,Theywork you hard and don't get paid enough unless you are seasonal but after that is up you get a job that is less paying. there is a lot of people that just do nothing while I work my  butt off and I think I deserve better
bad,"Routine tasks to be done everyday but also everyday brings something different. "
bad,"When I get into work the first thing I do is pick up after everyone else. After that I have to slave around for my shift doing heavy lifting breaking my back while simultaneously being underpaid. Then whenever you need a manager, they're almost never there. However, management has been improving as of late. The hardest part is dealing with all the other associates who leave all of their garbage laying around and their constant need to interrupt what you're doing. The most enjoyable part is leaving or conversing with the few people that are actually worth talking to."
bad,A typical day is very stressful for the money they pay there. Service managers do the same amount of work that an ASM does for about $20k or $30k less
bad,"I learned to that people who are talented move on. The management wants you to work more but to what end? Culture is ""i want to go home"" Most enjoyable part of the Job is working with the clients."
bad,"Very clear management does not care about employees. customers are very rude, for the most part they are not bad but it just takes one to ruin your day and you will get at least one every day."
bad,It's not so much my store I work for but the company keeps making changes for the worse and they might be saving some important salary money for the top dogs but its affecting the rest of the employees and customers. Ask any long time customer at Lowes how is their experience nowadays vs a year ago or more.
bad,"Started with this Co in 2001 and still work here for now.I have been in management  shortly after I started  and was working on a higher position.I am now what is called a CSA 5 and no longer a manager due to Lowe's company structure change.We had many benefits and bonus opportunity's taken away and seems they are not done ,again management is the problem."
bad,The culture that is expected does not come from the top. Top level management still use fear and intimidation tactics but expect store management to use softer approach.
bad,Where to start. Working here was pleasant for the first year however a lot of company changes have made this place a nightmare. Management sucks. They just toss people wherever they want just to say they have somebody working in a department regardless if they're knowledgeable about the place or not. I can go on a full rant about this particular Lowe's but I won't I love the company but this particular location is trash.
bad,Unfortunately Lowes cares more about profits than their employees. They have been replacing managers with part-timers. In the end this will be their downfall.
bad,No work/life balance what so ever.Close at 11 pm and then expected to be back at 6 am. This goes for part timers too. They strongly prefer part timers only as new hires.Their re-structuring is the same mistake Albertsons made which resulted in them closing in Texas.You can't cut staff and hours and expect more productivity.Reality and something that looks good on paper to stockholders are not compatible.
bad,"The company wants to cut costs, despite massive gains in revenue, by eliminating thousands of positions that make it hard for everyone to do their jobs because of less staffing."
bad,would not recommend if looking for a position with job security. Constant change and job security not promised. Salary and Benefits were good. Over all I would say 2 1/2 stars
bad,"Coworkers barely go out of their comfort zone of their area, let alone attempt to learn other areas. This would come in real handy when trying to help customers"
bad,"Stressful and although pay is decent fhe work life balance isnot fair and rhe expectations of the employees by the company can be unrealistic, used to be a much nicer place to work before the restructure"
bad,Lowes is a great store to shop and they stress cleanliness and stocking of shelves.  Where the company lacks is the training of its employees and there is so accountability for what that do on the sales floor.  The associates on the sales floor are basically free to do as they please as far as the times they come and go and how much customer service they must provide.  Managers and HR in my particular store seemed absolutely clueless how to motivate employees and follow-up
bad,Hourly associates / managers constantly under threat of job elimination / demotion in order to boost Corporate profits - expect earth shattering changes to the store level associates each January to increase stock price.
bad,"this was a great place to work till my ASM was replaced with a person who had no clue how to oversee the departments. Instead of looking for the good you do here they look for your mistakes and if there isnt one the asm as a group will find one. alot of supervisory bullying. ""do this or else ill make you life here a living nightmare"" or ""out to get you because you didnt bow and submit to there every request when you have a work load of your own their friends are in depts and the asm are well you have to help them or this place will not be a nice place to work"
bad,This company was once a great place to work but times and company have changed. You are just a number here and they work you to the bone with no remorse or care of your well being. Work every weekend and holidays.  Not much time left for family or life in general.
bad,Okay place to work and paycheck was acceptable. Problem is you got managers that don't know what they are doing and make decisions that make no sense.
bad,"Always understaffed, so regardless of your job position. You will be helping somewhere you're not supposed to. Like I said, the Management is ridiculous, they don't know what they're doing."
bad,The manager a horrible they show a lot of favoritism towards certain people. Your hard work is never valued yet the slackers are the ones who get promoted. The managers there show no professionalism . They harass you with no consequences . Worst store ever
bad,"The typical day of work at Lowes is like any other reail store, long hours, heavily customer service focus and sub pay. With that being said it is a great job for students that would like to work in summer and get some basic information on trades, meeting many people in the field."
bad,"Ever since the recent restructuring the mood at my Lowe's has declined sharply. Everyone is miserable and there is no real chance for advancement because all of those positions one could previously strive for have been eliminated. And there's talk of more cuts to come. Lowe's may pay really well to start, but there is no future there for you unless you like spinning your wheels."
bad,"Lowe's paid is low,  When seasonal approaches Lowe's will reduce employee hour and give those to the new hire.  Employees can not work more than 8 hours a day and if part time: an employee can not work more than 24 hours per week.  Lowe's has a lot of unwritten laws, that can get you in trouble if they ask you to do them and you get caught doing them.  Non manager employees are nice to work with.  The company has change their way of work structure.  This led to numerous fire across the country, so moving up the latter is gone."
bad,"When I stared with lowe's, was a good company to work for, and treated there employees well. Now it's about the how much money they can make for the CEO! Now the company has changed a lot and they don't care about the employees who due all of the work in the store."
bad,"Lowes compensates well for certain positions, the management seems to be way under qualified to do their job, difficult to advance because the ones at the top only care about more money and not their associates. Lowes is headed in the direction of Sears, who is now going bankrupt."
bad,"You will hear at the daily huddle how well your store is doing, comping, #1 in the market, but nothing comes back your way. Unqualified management staff. They will not show you how much they value you on your paycheck."
bad,"Was a great place to work till a HR manager left lowes. After she left everything went down hill with the company. Nobody cared about the employees, they just want high numbers and thats all."
bad,Spent 8 years of my life working hard and being loyal to this company and the CEO cuts 10000 positions. I was laid off without so much as a sorry or a thank you.
bad,"Lowe's is a company more than worth working with, it is lacking in motivating employees to seek advancement and in keeping up with the moral of the individuals employed."
bad,Its all about the profit and look good for the corporate visitor. Their expectations do not match the pay and human resource. Always want more but can't give more hours or hire more people.
bad,"The management at this particular location was lost.  It made it difficult to truly understand your daily responsibilities, therefore it made it difficult to move ahead.  Very scattered environment."
bad,"Often your department is understaffed. Management spends too much time in the office, with little time spent giving direction to those who need it. "
bad,"Work there for several years has its pros and cons. Like a family, depends on store. Get to meet alot of different people with different back grounds."
bad,The day with me at Lowe's starts out helping customers or one of the Head Cashier's will tell me that I have to cover someone's break. I learned later at this job that Job title doesn't matter. If they tell you that you have to cover you have to cover. The hardest part about working there is dealing with the associates that believe they can be the boss of you and treat you with disrespect.
bad,esta posicion fue la primera al comenzar a trabajar con ellos
bad,Always busy. Days go fast.  Pay not so great. Good people. The customers make it fun.  Process controls are lacking.  Crisis management seems to be the norm.
bad,"The mentality of the management team is to not think of their employees as people, but as numbers. It is not a business that respects forward thinking."
bad,"If you're into the bureaucracy of corporate retail and don't mind breaking your back for minimum wage, then you might enjoy lowes. Advancements aren't based on merit, just on favoritism and tenure. In my experience between working two stores, maybe 1/4 of my supervisors were good leaders."
bad,The management of this store is horrible. It has no diversity when it comes to upper management. All the minorities lost seniority when they downsized. The employees have horrible morale and management does nothing to help this. Horrible store to work at!
bad,Horrible schedule it's not uncommon to work 10 days in a row. It's a very common to open and close . I would go to work at 5 in the morning get off at 2 p.m. then I would work from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. at night the next day i would open at 5am and so on
bad,"I prefer not to comment at this time..."
bad,Supporting employees and providing an atmosphere and structure in which they can strive is one of the most important and challenging parts of building a business.
bad,"Lowes is a great company, but the management in the Carbondale, IL store during the time of my employment was fairly rude, and seemed very miserable. All of the managers were not that way; some were very friendly and business oriented."
bad,Work life balance is very hard to maintain. Company had 2 bad quarters and decided to cut almost 10% of management. The company then turned around and hired 2400 people in Canada.
bad,Becomes an over strained environment to work after short staffing. You'll be overworked and underpaid.  Many people are doing a lot less for a lot more.
bad,they took all of the spiff money away from the emp[loyees and that got rid of a bunch of good people including me..............................................
bad,Senior management team makes up policies and rules to suit them. If you're not one of the managers favourites then forget any promotions. It is very obvious who his favourites are too! They have no clue how to schedule. They move people around on a whim to try to get them to quit. As long as the store makes money the district/corporate team doesn't care at all what the morale of the store is. Too bad. It started out with such promise.
bad,"Typical day at Lowe's I filled with customer interaction."
bad,"What I have observed is, corporate can be very cut throat. They can demote or kick you out of your position at any moment. It does not mean anything how good you do your job. When it comes to cuts, it is cut throat. When they hire you, it doesn't mean you will be doing what you were hired to do either. Decent pay but not easy to work for. Benefits really are no good as with the health care. It has a $3k deductible."
bad,"Corporate retail conglomerate, better than walmart. Still does not care about its employees, will not properly train or invest in quality workers. CEO is an idiot and lacks the vision to get the company past Depot. He would rather lay off good people to make share holders money instead of doing something innovative to progress the company like a true leader would. I was, however, paid well during my tenure at Lowe's."
bad,I actually liked my job for the the first few years. As time went on the company kept changing and those changes were to please the shareholders which left the employees feel abandoned.
bad,after working here for 14 years was let go and job was given to someone with no experience company restructured less dept managers and more part timers
bad,I worked there for a total of 15 years and the compensation was not good. In the end I didn't feel like a team member but a number that could be replaced easily!
bad,"Completely clueless upper mgmt.  No ability to order inventory at Store level. Policies ignored unless they benefit Store Management. Worst IT on earth. No soul, they talk a good game but couldn't care less about the rank and file"
bad,"Sales support software systems unreliable and difficult to use. Most departments are chronically understaffed. Lowe's will eventually fulfill customer's needs, but often with long delays and numerous mistakes. Upper management is completely tone deaf to store needs."
bad,"The job and people are fantastic, but you better hope you don't get sick.  I was diagnosed with ovarian tumors in October 2015 and my doctor put me on medical leave in early November before having surgery.  Needless to say my FMLA paperwork was handled incorrectly by Lowe's and Reed Group, and that caused me to lose my job due to paperwork ""not being received"" or ""lost"". I was told by management I could either be terminated for absences or resign. Lowe's will tell you everyone is ""family"" but when it comes down to it they just don't care."
bad,"I was only there a few days and had the manager ask me out on the 4th day at the beginning of my shift, can you say awkward? Let alone he texted me almost immediately at the end of my shift and several times later, even a week after I left he was still texting. I would be there at work and he would follow me asking questions about myself rather then doing his job. Personally I have been retaliated against for saying no to men in the workplace but luckily none of them were ever in management. I found it very unprofessional and uncomfortable. You would think they would know better.  I got offered a job elsewhere and quickly took it."
bad,It's repetious and depending upon your position your treated far worse and there is any improvement on benefits for employees and the hard work they put in.
bad,"The overall mindset of everyone in my dept. would agree that there is too much put on one person. Dealing with customers issues is hard enough without being expected to make sure that installers and the store do what they are supposed to do. "
bad,"It has it's pro's and con's, quite similar to The Home Depot in many respects to management and its inequalities with promotion and hiring."
bad,"Starter job, good for part time. Co-workers are nice, willingness to always help you with any  questions. Great to learn more and become well rounded with knowledge"
bad,"Higher management have a habit of playing favoritism  to among the employees. The higher management has made poor decisions over the course of the last several years. The company started out as a family related company, but Upper management has become money hunger and forgot the people that make them look good."
bad,This was a new store when I worked with Lowes. It was in need of management change. I worked there for 4 years. Company as a whole seems good.
bad,Lowes do well with working with your schedule for the most part. If you are a person that needs weekends all the time lowes probably isn't for you being that you only get one weekend per month and if you're not aware you probably wouldn't get that weekend. The upper management sucks especially the store manager Dan; He tries to be really strict without giving the proper help or communication!! His management team reflect him.
bad,"You must be in a click to be accepted.  If the management does not like you, you will not be promoted.  I witnessed people that we unable to work in a certain department be promoted and made a manager of another department."
bad,Management sucks and there's too much favoritism in advancement. New employees get promoted before people with more experience with the company all the time.
bad,"Management was the main problem , hard to work around request. needed more support of associates . assoc. were good ."
bad,will work may Saturdays and Sundays hard to PTO approved fun to meet new team members and customers. Management is very nice and willing to help you learn and grow.
bad,"Working for lowes reminded me of high school.  Petty people, unprofessional work environment with immature management.  A direct quote from an employee, ""People always talk badly about other people, thats what we do at work.""  This was a quote when i approached someone who blamed me, a new employee at the time, instead of owning up to his own responsibilities."
bad,"if you were on Facebook social media etc. you were in if not you were sort of outcast, which was what i was sense I've never had any of these."
bad,Most of the people there are nice just don't get talk to when they are being lazy I work hard there everyday and have a baby on the way and when I apply for full time there they give the job to someone else which is why don't feel respected there they keep passing me up. Just don't really enjoy working there anymore.
bad,"On my first day I couldn't believe  I was entering Lowe's as an employee.  My only previous experience as an employee or a retail sales specialist in the last 22 years, had been entirely on my terms so I had much to learn. "
bad,"Stressful job at times, staff in our department can be nowhere to be found.  Many times, the staff in my department, leaves before their shift is over without telling anyone.  However, the customers can be fun & nice to deal with, I like that part of the job. I like a challenge."
bad,I come in at 4am  scan the whole store for holes and work with special  orders. I find all the special orders in the store and make sure they are tagged.  Once a week i lower the prices and retag the items. I also call and get credit for any returns that may have come back theh day before
bad,"No job security, highly overworked with little to no recognition. No adherence to HR policies, nor to PIPEDA legislation.  Fire at will, no consideration to bullying, overwork, and little to no support from upper management with customers or peak busy times."
bad,"a typical day here was to pursue customers and try to get a sale of the merchandise, learned about the hardware there and even how to install some home products."
bad,"typical management"
bad,"I really wish not to put anything down for this company at this time or at anytime in the future. Thank You, the coworkers are good"
bad,"Culture has changed.  No loyalty.  Have a back-up plan ready as they turn people over.  They used to say ""don't go to Charlotte banks because of turnover"".  Lowe's is now worse than the banks.  Bad decisions by senior executives leave others to be ""people productivity"" casualties (but not them)."
bad,"Cashiers were treated bad and often quit. No coverage. Rude and unsupportive management and coworkers. Difficult schedules going against availability."
bad,"Management is horrible. They only care about lining their own pockets. If they could, they would make you work for free just so they can get a bigger bonus."
bad,great team work setting. Only problem is lack of communication with managers. Enjoy meeting new people and learning different things from each department that I apply at my home.
bad,"Summary says it all, no OSHA enforcement. Routine violations observed and ignored by management. No support from team leads, managers. Hopefully this is isolated to the one I worked at."
bad,"i worked in receiving always something different each day."
bad,lowes is always under staffed with a large turnover. The co-workers and customers are the best part of the day. I enjoy working with the public. I want to treat people the way I would like to be treated. With respect and compassion. .And with the understanding that they were helped in the best possible way.
bad,"Most of my coworkers are very nice to work with and helpful when they want to be. There are some good positions to get into and decent advancement. However management seems to not care for any concerns that you have( at least at my store) and just brush it off. Don't really explain changes that are made. I've learned a lot about retail (ordering,refunds,skus, and other various technical things). I've learned that there is a lot of grey area in my store and bias. There seems to be no moral or ethical aspects and it is just sloppy."
bad,"A typical day is very intense with call volume. Where you are processing claims, service calls and getting yelled out by customers. Some are the superviors are young and not as professional. The co-workers are easy to get along with besides the complaining."
bad,Bad place to work. Management lie continuously. It who you know to advancement. Do not go thru with promised opportunity. It is all about store profit and the management bonuses not about the employees who do the bulk of the work. Pay is low for expected work amount.
bad,To best describe this Company  is to many chiefs not enough employees. I loved helping customers. But the structure of the company working with 2 employees every night for the whole building was a disaster.cu
bad,Sporadic hours with not a lot of work to do when your there. Cool co workers complain a lot little to no supervision when working.
bad,Job is ok. Understaffed and underpaid. Weird work hours and days off. Not very supportive in Religious views. Not a good place to work if you have a family.
bad,"Little chance of advancement, low pay, monotonous job tasks but very physically demanding. Good job to have while looking for a real opportunity."
bad,I did price changes for the store everyday and also did Head Cashier duties. Work with different customer's on a daily basis.
bad,"what a joke. They will work you for almost 14 hours some days and you will do it for up to 9 days straight before they give you a 1 day weekend. Good luck trying to have any out of work life. They will urinate down your back and tell you it's raining. Pay was alright, but you will be physically whipped every day. plus they barely have anyone to pull orders or load the trucks. As the driver you will do all these things."
bad,"Learned how to use all of the products sold "
bad,management is the worst does not have employees interest in mind at all . co corkers are nice . management wants you to do everything while they sit in offices and do nothing all day . i dont recommend anyone to work there lots of favortism
bad,I enjoy my job for the most part but there are days I work by myself and that is no fun. I have been on this job for a while and I don't see that things are getting better. I enjoy meeting new people and seeing customers get what they need to complete theirs jobs with smiles on their faces.
bad,"The compensation and benefits are by far some of the best I have seen in my part time jobs, however the employees hired by the management are lazy and unhelpful to the customers. The many managers that they have do little and communicate to the other employees and managers extremely poorly. The HR department is of little help when a serious issue occurs."
bad,"This job was an OK, wouldn't go back to working there however. Just a lot of issues and conflict with workers and even management. It is a retail company so the level of employees you get are not the highest quality. Lowe's has a horrible turnover rate for employees, at least at the one I worked from."
bad,The best part about working for Lowes was how nice the people that work there are but I found it very difficult to progress in this company during my time there. I applied to many many positions that I felt qualified for and never received so much as an interview. I provided my managers with open availability to schedule me yet they cut my hours regularly and would never move me to full time status. Very confusing and frustrating employer to work for.
bad,"They have bad safety at D.C. If you get hurt, they hire lawyers to fight your workers compensation claim(s) to keep employees (associates) from getting their proper care. You suffer in pain while they fight it.  They won't pay you the vacation and sick pay the employee you are owed after you quit."
bad,It was a great place to get my feet wet. I did get a great grasp of business relationship development.
bad,It's tough to work in a environment when you schedule varies weekly including different days off each week.  Customers can be easy and sometimes extremely difficult.
bad,"Considering it is a retail environment it is a fair work place.  It is perfect for students and those who search for extra part time employment.  However, if your goal is to move up within the company there is minimal opportunity to do so outside of knowing the right people.  Full time positions are easy to come by if you show effort and engagement.  Department manager positions don't necessarily require any education or training.  Assistant store management positions and above require knowing the right people in the right places, as most stores hire senior management positions based solely on ""advice"" of other store managers."
bad,"Management turnover"
bad,"I learned how to operate heavy equipment."
bad,If you are in the circle you are ok your time card will be fixed so you have no iisues. If you party with the in crowd you are also ok but if you don't get along with Human resources you are blacklisted and treated unfairly . and Human resource Manager works maybe 30 hours a week but runs the store  it is all about her bonus check with is the EOS score so in September they will be nice to all
bad,"If they let people do what they are hired for , and treated them well this could be a great co. Instead they tend to react to whatever comes down from corp to the detriment of the store. Every week they would send out a new E mail with a new rule with the same threat. "" Up too and including termination. They rule by threats and intimidation. If that's the way you run a co ; then there is something very wrong. There's a reason they go through so much help."
bad,Management does not respect any workers. False promises led to me resigning my job.
bad,"Low work-life balance"
bad,"You get to interact with customers who are generally friendly and always willing to have a conversation, making the job very bearable. The problem that I have with Lowe's in the Bryan location is that the management here is the worst that I've ever been under. Out of all the store managers that we have, only 1 of them come into work with smiles on their faces and acknowledge his underlings. The rest of the managers don't even care to know your name. Help is not readily available, the response time for customers who need assistance is unbelievably delayed because many of the employees simply don't care or help is not available. If you're working in the front end you receive the wrath of the customer's anger due to the work of many of your coworkers that work on the sales floor. If it wasn't for the friendly environment produced by the customers, I would have left a long time ago. "
bad,The work enviornment is friendly and clean. A typical work day however does not have sufficient workload to make the day move along.
bad,The Dept. Manager Loss Prevention lacked in training to train NEW employee's!
bad,"I truly loved my job when i started. Now I wish i had gotten out sooner. I was forced to transfer stores because I was a head cashier and my girlfriend work on the sales floor and that is when it all went down hill. I had a great Zone manager at my new store and the cashiers were pretty good. My dept manager was one of the worst I have ever dealt with. She had her faves and if you weren't one of them then you weren't nothing Bad hours and shifts. I know that she was doing everything in her power to get me fired. After many ridiculous write ups I was forced to take a demotion. While I stayed on for almost 2 more years, I was asked to not only perform the same responsibility as before my demotion, I also was expected to train the people that they promoted. It went so far as them passing me up for another promotion in favor of someone they deem as more qualified then having me train that person. Leaving that place was the best decision I ever made."
bad,"A typical day of a cashier at lowe's involves a lot of standing and waiting for customers then when they do appear you do usually simple cashier transactions to give them their product and send them on their way. The management doesn't like to see cashiers move to any other part of the store, other parts however don't have such restriction. You will learn how to deal with poor management for a large store though. The managers for different departments don't seem to talk to each other so complications arise a fair bit and they all seem to be more interested in the bottom line of the store and making sure the customer isn't mad at them, than the needs of their employees and as such the turnover rate is quite high. Most scheduling is random with no set days for anyone so planning your free time can be a bit of a hassle unless you book off a day a month or so in advance. When it is busy you'll have stuff to do all day and will be left alone to do your work so long as you aren't screwing up at it. It can be easy to move up in the company if you really sell yourself to it and keep making sure management is aware that you want to move up. If not you'll most likely stay at the position you're at. The most enjoyable part is some of the non-manager co-workers. They're all going through the same struggle so bonding isn't that hard. But the hardest part is dealing with the management not doing their job so you're understaffed or don't have the supplies you need or simply getting in trouble for something that's no your fault."
bad,"Cashing out customers,stocking shelves,taking and making order on the customer or at desk. Answering phones and transferring them to the departments.  Giving customers of knowledge about the products we carry and making an assessment of what products are right for them. Making sure they have a store credit card to save money and if they don't telling them the different options and assessing which on is right for them."
bad,Great selection of nursery plants including native perennials
bad,"Typical day was meetings, and coaching agents, reports, interacting with agents and my peers.  "
bad,"Unless you want a job where you will go nowhere, or are ok with getting fired from unexpectedly after a few years, don't bother."
bad,would return to work there and enjoyed been a part of the managements staff.
bad,"Don't expect to move up the coperate ladder. As with most call centers, you may get to mentor and train, but you will never leave whatever position you were hired for.  They like cogs in the machine."
bad,"My job was to receive ,unload trucks and to manage the stock to be put up in a safe manner. It was a  very time management job, you hade to be very efficient with your time. I love the job it keep you busy  and was making a difference. The only thing that was bad at the job, was the communication between other managers, one would what done this way, and the other manager wants it done different"
bad,Lowe's is overall a great company.  However there are some task required by management that need to be stream lined.  The company itself is not very innovative and the technology needs to be updated.  It would create a better work/life balance for its management.
bad,"just a job not much teamwork , a lot of missed opportunities store changes  with every new manager . seems like the stores focus changes every month .. advancement is available at your own risk as there is no training for new positions. alot of the more seasoned employees refuses advancement regularly .Family life is not a priority at all."
bad,"As a seasonal employee you will be worked hard.  There is no garuntee that you will be hired permanently, nor that any position you apply for will be considered."
bad,"Its a job I like the people I work with, I just wish they could find better managers in the different zones."
bad,"Not my favorite place to work. The typical day at work included a morning meeting where the store manager announced everything that would be going on that day. The day didn't last long because I was part time along with about 70 percent of other employees. The only full time people at lowes are the managers and the department managers. I worked three years in a clerical position and was never offered or accepted for any of the 11 applications I put in. It might have been due to my age, because I have 15 years of managerial experience and four years of college, but apparently not good enough to have a department job. It seems mostly boys in their 20's get those jobs. One other person sued this store for age discrimination and won. So it's a good possiblity."
bad,if managment gets the wrong impression on you they will never promote you no matter how hard you work.co-workers are the best very helpful. drop hours for part timers frequently
bad,One of my worst experience working. Coworkers treated you unfair and very micro-managed.
bad,this is an ok place to work.  typically i never stop moving. always helping customers
bad,"fly by day job unless your looking to become a store manager of a store, pretty much a throw away job."
bad,"The managament all the way to the top do not care about employees or any retaliation that happens to the employees that work for them. Illegal and Disgusting things happen in the West Valley City, Utah store on 4050 S. 5600 W.. Problems there have been reported multiple times and nothing was done. I would suggest looking for work at least at another store and one where Bart is not the Store Manager."
bad,"The pay is low, the management is poor, employees are expected to any thing that is asked of them wether that is in their job description or not.  No questions asked."
bad,Good people but the employees feel less and less appreciated by the company.
bad,They cut our hours back but expect you to work twice as hard to finish unloading the truck then pull out all of the freight. Sometimes there are double trucks and we don't have the time to finish sometimes plus they don't pay enough and the raises are a joke.
bad,"A typical work day for me is to come in to work clock in. greet the customers, ring up merchandise, clean up the bathrooms and break room, refund and rebuild, customer service, sweep, Put out certain merchandise from stock. I wish management was more encouraging and social. I also wish they'd recognize us a good workers. The hardest part of my job is working extra hard because of the store being short staffed more than 75% of the time. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. I enjoy talking and interacting with the customers."
bad,Don't do it unless you have to!!! Not everyone was bad... Just upper corporate management.
bad,Not a great company to work for if you value time with your family or room for advancement.
bad,"I worked here for almost 7 years before they fired me because I tried getting a promotion. They put targets on people's back when they hit a certain amount of years or when they stop giving you raises. When I started, it was great but the turnaround through this company is ridiculous. They say they care about employees but when it comes down to it, they would rather put food in your mouth to make you forget whats important than actual change. If you want a promotion, you're better off being new since they can mold you how they want. they cater to the new people and hope the old ones will just finally move on. overtime was great but they would tell you that it was required the day before you're suppose to work it so if you had plans, say good bye to those. and if you have kids, don't even think about getting special treatment. they are a family there that does not care about your family. worse place i've ever been."
bad,"Lowe's pays well and offers benefits to part timers but that is about all the positive things that can be said about working for them. "
bad,"No room for advancement, no mentorship program and no support from upper mgmt."
bad,Overall is Lowe's as a company can be a great place to work. Individual stores are the reason that cons over shadow the pros. If management can understand that all departments in the stores help the company succeed. 
bad,"Typical days are pretty busy in my position.  I have always been a team player and not one to leave things for someone else to do and working here I have learned even more of the importance of follow through on different situations.  The hardest part of my job would be knowing what page different managers are on, they all seem to expect different things to perform the same task!  It is very difficult to go in and think that it is going to be a smooth day, due to not knowing what way they are going to want you to work today.  I very much enjoy most of the interactions I get to have with the customers and the problem solving aspect of my position."
bad,"Let's start off with the atmosphere. It's more like Lowe's High if anything else. You have your ""clique's"" which is usually the tool club, who been around for awhile and think they run the place. "
bad,"Typical customer service issues; Special Orders, Deliveries, refunds, credit issues, etc."
bad,"Zero promotions. No recognition for hard work. Each employee must apply and interview for every position they want, competing with other internal and external candidates. Previous hard work or achievement for the company is not taken into account."
bad,"run cash register service desk and return desk"
bad,Asked customers for any assistance or recommendations on their purchases. Interpreted for none English speaking customers.
bad,There super nice to you in the beginning then become very cruel as time goes one
bad,"Good place to learn and develop skills, have good benefit program for students."
bad,not going to go into everything that makes your job hard then it is.
bad,"Scheduling employees, routining deliveries, unloading and loading trucks. Auditing trucks, pre-shift meeting. Complying with monthly budgets/labor hours"
bad,Very stressful work enviroment. Cut throat with fellow employees and management. Speed stressed with little regard for safety out of the store area. Liked interacting with customers but the berating from customers took a tole on spirit and ablilty to work productively
bad,"Management was never organized, or knowledgable about what was going on with everyday schedules of employees. Co-workers were pleasant and friendly to work with for the most part. Enjoyable part of job was meeting people."
bad,"Assess work load and direct employees to achieve assigned tasks. Time management is crucial in getting all tasks achieved. Management empowers employees to make decisions to achieve assigned tasks. We strive to work as team to get the best possible outcome. There is never one day that is the same, being able to react to whatever happens to obtain the best possible outcome. I work with a very close-knit team which makes my job more enjoyable."
bad,Enjoyed the customers /some employes hardest is not being able to advance and seeing people with less experence get the job i was trying to get
bad,"Lowe's is overall a great company to work for, in the past year they have made some changes for the better of the company. The sales specialist position has take a big reduction in pay as a result a 50% commission cut. I have hopes thing will change for the better this coming fiscal year. But my on going resurch shows it may get worse for the store level employees and the commission pay may all go away. At this point I can not afford to stay employed a lowe's."
bad,I worked for this company for over 12 years....it was a great and fun place to work! But now it is like they forget about what affects the foundation...your employees!! As a manager I did as I was trained to always be there for your associates...but it comes down to is no advancement and low ball you on your wages!!They will strip your pay if they want to!! CEO is a joke spending company money on stupid stuff that customers could care less about !!!
bad,Money focused company. Lacks customer service. Good product supply. Atmosphere is not desireable.
bad,"Started fleixable hours. started as a customer service assiocate in kitchen design. Sold appliances, organize stock with electrical reach truck. Learned 20/20 kitchen design program. Management moved to paint department learned to mix and have aquired good product knowledge for what different aplication, tools customer needed for their home and commerical project. Got move to plumbing learned good product knowledge and kept up with product maintence. Then aws moved to Electrical deptartment. Was learning alot of electrical and some small electronic knowlegdge. Worked as an assembler for new stroe products. Helped with frieght and packdown. Work on special projects."
bad,"Although there were reasonable opportunities for advancement, and most of the people were nice and fun to work with, availability requirements were rather onerous. I was often required to work both day and night shifts in the same work week, in some cases working until 10pm on a Friday and then required to work at 6:30am the next day. Full time employees are promised one weekend off per month, but this was often rescinded with little or no notice, causing havoc in one's personal life. The work week began on Saturday, and in some cases I would work six mixed day/night shifts in a row, get one day off, and work four more shifts in a row, which was difficult for my family. There was tremendous pressure placed on employees, across the board, to sell credit plans and loyalty cards to every customer, which turned off many customers, who would complain that I was the ""fifth associate in one visit to the store who tried to sell me a card of some sort"". The Muzak in the store is loud and repetitious and interfered with customer/associate communication. The store management structure was top-loaded and the many layers of store mngrs, zone mngrs, and dept. mngrs were often at odds and contradicted each other. I would sometimes be giving new or younger employees and part-timers instruction on proper procedure only to have a mngr come around the corner and order us to ""break it up"" and it seemed that mngrs were under even more pressure than the rank and file."
bad,"Now, don't let this review discourage you apply, since this is my personal opinion. I worked here in the beginning before the store was open. I liked it at first but things started getting a little weary after my lead cashier was changed. She was very awkward, in to herself and although she was married she didn't like it when the other cashiers received attention from other employees or customers and would embarrass them. then we had one of the managers, whom; it was her way or the highway. I didn't necessarily quit but because i was honest as to why I could not show up for work, she says i could not unless i had a doctors note. the next day she calls me and asked what my excuse was and i replied with "" because you said not to unless i had a doctors note."" She then asked if i could be at work in a very polite manner but i refused and quit. They really degrade you here also. The men in lumber and materials would place bets on dating the cashiers with the store manager and some how it never got to HR."
bad,"I'm sure that the inland empire of Ca. is not representative of the company, but the store that I worked in has a terrible store manager. She publically berates her employees, creates an environment of pitting employees against eachother, and seems to have a set of HR values seperate from the company in general. For instance, she might grant a vacation, but 'reserve the right to cancel it at any time'. A couple of years ago there was an opening for an assistant manager. Only 8 people company-wide applied. A month later there was the same opening at a store 12 miles away. Over 100 applications. The employees there are very unhappy, but content just to have a job, which is constantly threatened by store management, with comments like; ""if you people can't improve the sales around here, some of you are going to lose your jobs"". I would never know from day-to-day if today would be my last, and this is the general sentiment. Turn-over is rampant, and over half the store is on their 'final' write-up at any given time. Better to work at Walmart or McDonalds"
bad,it pays good if you are management and above but till you work your way up to that they do not treat you like a human
bad,"I will comment based on the ratings. The level of compensation ratio to qualification is unfair and unjustified. I have seen unqualifieds with little or no experience come in with higher than deserved pay, and those who were qualified receiving less. Though the values for the company make sense, I've yet to see a store follow them. There are a handle full of employees at each store that are worth their salt, but most are just spinning their wheels and hate working for the company. I find advancement shakey at best, it is easy to make it to full time, but to make management is even more difficult and salary management is impossible. Lowes hires from outside the company most of the time and the new managers are usually substandard and jerks at best. The lack of values with the management team and cursing of employees in the aisles publically is more like episodes of ""Deadliest Catch."" The job security is unbalanced, you can show up late and call in all the time, even slack off at work and never get disciplined, be sure to play the race, religion, and mael/female card and you are untouchable. If you like to work hard and take pride in what you do, do not work for Lowes, you will regret the return on investment. Management is shakey and flaky. Expect to be told one thing, you do that thing, then get chastized and critisized for you efforts, then redo your work again only to have your work look the exact same as before. The management is only there for the money and not for the employees or for the enjoyment of being a Lowes manager. The work life balance is horrible, rotating 8"
bad,Working in a call center is almost demoralizing. Everything is measured. I answer inbound calls
bad,"One may think a big-name like Lowe's Hardware would be an amazing place to dabble in the latest and greatest technology - it must take a ton of great stuff to keep a company in the top Fortune 50 running with 1500+ stores and tonnes of data. Sadly, it's not the case, and I have learned it is common with many other enterprise-level IT jobs in retail environments."
bad,they really dont care about their employees. Assistant store manager will work as hard as they can for you only to have the store manager and HR manager ruin what you worked towards
bad,I was hired full time and never got full time hours. Every week they made me work different hours. Management is nothing short of drill sargents running a tight ship.
bad,"Health benefits are good offer 401 k plan, customers are great, employees are dun to work with"
bad,"Antiquated computer selling system, is the most used but I had to learn 5 different systems.  The selling system is in dos, I haven't seen it anywhere else this century.  They schedule you to work 4 hrs one day then 9 the next.  Have benefits for part time, but you are better off not getting them.  The company has GREAT employees who are not being taken care of well.  My supervisor joked layoffs"
bad,They do not appreciate the cashiers at all! They give us so many problems about our schedules every week. It could be freezing cold in the garden center and they still have it open .
bad,"I was a seasonal cashier. I was hired and really happy and energized with working for lowes. But sadly a certain member of the management was just a real jerk to be honest. I felt he was just after me as a person, anything i did wasnt good enough and he would come up with reason to be disappointed in me. "
bad,"A typical day in the paint department at Lowe's Home Improvement began with the daily cleaning of the paint dispensers and verifying that the machines are properly functioning. The daily task at the paint department involved attending customers with questions, needs, and applications of paint. The management at Lowe's was decent and was not really involved in the department operations. The management in my experience was only involved in the hiring and scheduling of employees. The workplace culture appeared to always be short-staffed but also customer focused. The toughest part of the job was pleasing customers with a limited staff."
bad,Needs better management all the way up the ladder. Crazy  work hours. Almost as if the lazy workers get rewarded with better jobs while the hard workers get punished with more work at same or lower pay.
bad,"While working there, I had issues with management. The coworkers were great and made the environment much better. It was close to where I reside. However management made it difficult to work there when school started again."
bad,"My job was good as far as hours, but management was horrible and pay was a little low. They couldn't figure out my direct deposit the whole time I was there and it was frustrating."
bad,"Store Manager show up every now and then, when he does it is in plain clothes to spy on the employees. Does not know how to use any of the registers nor helps out if needed."
bad,There is no room for advancment in this Company. If your happy starting in a low position and staying there then this is the company for you. There is also favortism involved in hiring and internal promotions.
bad,"Just plain toxic.  management more concerned with themselves than with keeping associates engaged enough to stay.  Favoritism is the norm, and concerns are not adequately addressed."
bad,"The company pays fairly well, with decent benefits. However, despite advertising advancement opportunities, they only exist for a select few. This strongly relates to the omnipresent mismanagement within the store I was in. Favorites were promoted long before positions even opened up (and positions were created by eliminating current, qualified, tenured employees). Mismanagement runs awry."
bad,When I first started working there I was excited and majority of the people were nice. After a month or two I started being harassed by a co-worker. When I first reported it no one addressed it. When it was finally addressed their solution was to fire me and the other person. I also had two issues with customers stalking and threatening to kidnap me. Nothing was done about that either.
bad,Recent changes to scheduling for full time associates only getting 1 weekend off every 8 weeks along with other changes have reduced morale. Some advancement opportunities.
bad,"Employees are good.  Some bad Apples. Staff is very criticizing.  Stab you in the back. Employees don't like to say anything,  they will fire you. They allow abuse by employees."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with the public. Mainly because when a customer wants to be difficult and yell for no reason, I had to fight back the urge to walk away so I can make sure they found what they needed."
bad,"The pay, for a retail job, is pretty good. The job isn't too difficult, it's pretty much your basic retail job requirements. At my store in particular, everyone gets along mostly decently. However, one thing all of us can collectively agree on is that management SUCKS. They WILL hold your job over your head as a threat and are extremely disrespectful about how they speak to employees. They make you feel like trash and I honestly wonder whether people not its worth it some days. If you absolutely need a new job right now it's not bad but if you have other options, TAKE THEM.."
bad,"This job was a call center, I assisted customers with resolving their issues through troubleshooting their equipment. If I could not help the customer with trouble shooting, I would set up an appointment for a technician to come out there and repair the equipment."
bad,"Lowe's has recently implemented many new policies and programs that hinder its ability to take care of its employees, including erratic and spotty scheduling in the store, an overly strict attendance policy, and unrealistic work expectations from a corporate level. Most decisions are made to look good on paper for the stockholders."
bad,I worked as full time cashier 2016 to 2018. Cashier in garden center. Worked in heat advisory weather in summer managers did not care too give u a break from the heat or cold weather.. Lowe‚Äôs does not care about its employees all the managers care about is sales so they can get a bonus. Otherwise I recommend you to not take a position in garden center anywhere else insid store is ok. Because u will be in the building.
bad,"My interview at my local store started with ""you're overdressed"" as I was in a dress shirt, dress pants and a vest. The rest of the interview was lack luster and conveyed that the manager had poor interviewing skills or just didn't care."
bad,"Job is a fair entry level money maker, however is by no means a career. The company itself is hostile to work for with how they treat employees. However the pay is good and the people are great. Lowe's is certainly a job for every college student looking for a seasonal job."
bad,"A Typical day of work involves helping customers , cut keys, find product, re-keying locks. Stocking Shelves, Helping Co-workers with their tasks....."
bad,I started off as seasonal and it was alright but then I transferred to full time and I was given alright benefits and an alright pay. I am however the only full timer in my whole department and some managers are good but others are completely just out of touch with anything going on. It‚Äôs retail so you deal with bad customers but there are also some very nice ones. It‚Äôs a coin toss if you‚Äôll have good coworkers or not if you end up having bad ones management doesn‚Äôt do much in regards to discipline and the scheduling sucks.
bad,Used to be a wonderful place to work. New CEO and his team are ruining what was once a great place. Benefits are being cut. Management and hourly employees are stretched to thin. Highly stressful
bad,"As a corporation, Lowe‚Äôs can be a fantastic place to work. With the new CEO, some restructuring is happening, bringing on extra stress about layoffs and roles changing. The managers at individual stores make or break the experience."
bad,A rotating work schedule made it hard to get a consistent sleep habit. Too many managers telling you to do different things. No support from HR. Changing your position in the store without any input. Lack of respect from upper management.
bad,It was always very busy and understaffed. Most days you're working nonstop but always very unappreciated. No matter how much you do for the company - it is never enough. The benefits were good.
bad,"Its a complete cluster to work for this company. Rules and job titles change constantly, unfair and inconsistent pay scales. Terrible moral and a CEO that I am not sure he knows what he is doing. Management constantly in a bad mood and stressed out. Turn over rate is crazy, the hiring is constant and store is always understaffed."
bad,It's an ok job alot of stress dealing with trailers but it's ok had a set schedule and didn't have to do too much of if I didn't want to  but some managers are impossible
bad,Been working there for about six months and their more about making the company money then employee. When i was first hired i was very excited to work but over time i began to realize how unnecessarily stressful and annoying the job was their many focus is money. Which honestly is quite sad.
bad,Not very happy about giving them 7 good years of service and then get sent to backshift. They have restructured and have all long term employees in a terrible situation.
bad,"Short Staffed in stores, unrealistic expectations from higher ups, always feel like job is on the line, everyone in store is unhappy, our ASM's and DS's are cool but stressed out."
bad,"District and regional teams have no clue how to take stores to new levels of success, all about themselves and just allot of talk, support from district and regional levels are a joke. To sum it up is they are hammers and everyone is a nail."
bad,Was great job other then days off then they drop sales bonus.they last a lot of people because they got greedy an not want to pay sale no us anymore company wide
bad,"I was in charge of the facility upkeep and cleaning while ion my shift. The management left something to be desired , they need to work on organization and communication ."
bad,"It's a standard job in retail, a day mostly comprised of helping customers and maintaining the department in which you work. The lower level Dept managers are helpful but the upper level managers ASM and store managers make your day difficult and have high demands of lower level employees. The common theme of the job culture and the unanimous common feeling of everyone from the upper management and below is, doing more work than compensated to do..."
bad,Since he started he has laid off literally thousands of hard working dependable associates...he doesn't care about people...but sure does care about his own pockets. Store Management is terrified of area management.
bad,No job security. They are making massive changes and keep eliminating positions. People that have been with the company for years losing jobs due to position elimination.
bad,"Was not the best place I have worked for, unprofessional at times. Training was unorganized, as well as the rest of the environment. Basically a place for people who have retired to work."
bad,"Some of the managers are good at doing their job, however there is to much to be said about laziness or the communication issues. The Lowe‚Äôs I worked at isn‚Äôt the best in these fields however the coworkers can be a highlight."
bad,With management change it isn't the best place to work lately. Very poor moral in the store I work in. I dont feel we should have to review the place you work for. There are reasons why I would search indeed for a new job.
bad,"If you want to be treated like a dog and unappreciated then, by all means, work at Lowe's.  They are part-time benefits which is nice but the insurance isn't all that great for part-timers.  Management varies store to store and HR is virtually non-existent. The CEO is slowly destroying the company from within.  It used to be a great place, not anymore.  Pay is above minimum wage which is also nice but they will work you hard."
bad,"This was an okay job. I liked the community and being able to work outside, however some of the other employees were just flat out rude to new employees. The environment just wasn‚Äôt for me."
bad,"Round Rock location has horrible management!!!!  The former store manager (who was the biggest nightmare) has now been moved up to manage multiple stores in the state of Texas, so many more people will have the privilege of experiencing his lack of care for employees, as well as customers.  His only worry is the next 'store walk' and how everything will look to corporate, not how well it functions as a hardware store for customers that need products, tools or assistance.  He always has his phone attached to his ear and when asked questions by customers, will pass them off to an employee who is already busy helping another customer vs stop and help the customer himself.  He promises the sun/moon/stars but will not actually follow through with 1/3 of what he claims. The new manager of the RR La Frontera store is rude and will not hear you out about concerns or suggestions about changes within departments.  The departments themselves are ALWAYS understaffed and do not have enough coverage for proper customer service or to allow employees to take breaks/lunches on time...if at all!!"
bad,Hard to advance but overall stable. I was going to school for the majority of my time there so it makes it a little bit harder to judge since I always thought of it as temporary.
bad,"I had a very different experience at Lowe's than Home Depot. The schedules are posted 3 weeks in advance, so request time off before posting. I was in the outside garden center and backed up the inside garden center. At this store, there were many ' cliques' in co-workers and some co-workers were not willing to help you. Some Management would support you and listen to you while others did not. Many Employees called in 'sick' very often and many days there were not enough Employees to help customers, creating stress on the customers and the employees."
bad,There‚Äôs a lot of changes with management and how things are operated. All the adults gossip about one another. They give you no chances for advancement throughout the store. The job doesn‚Äôt suck just the operation side does.
bad,"Lowe's itself is an ok company to work for, and the jobs available in the warehouse really aren't that bad.  A lot of the people are easy to get along with and work fairly well.  But the Janesville millwork doesn't have very good management.  The current plant manager doesn't seem to care much for his workers' happiness and a lot of people are really upset with him.  That's where most of the problems stem from."
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs gets in the way of itself by creating ‚Äúprograms and systems‚Äù that are not fully planned out or well-communicated to those whom are to use those programs. There is little to no accountability when it comes to those who should be required to know how to fully perform their job, but therein lies the issue of training for implemented programs and systems."
bad,I enjoyed working for LOWE‚ÄôS from the level to working at one of their RDC‚ÄôS . I worked for the company for 7 1/2 years and towards the end I truly hated the store management. Unfortunately I was overlooked for every position I applied for mainly not being a butt kisser . I did work with some awe ASM‚ÄôS and co-workers during the time with the company. Unfortunately the Corporate Office toke away a lot of opportunities in the way of advancing in the store level. What I found rather upsetting was new hires were starting off at $15/hr and I was not . Your lucky to get a dollar raise for your review most of the time you don‚Äôt get one .or if you do it‚Äôs between 15 cents up to 35 cents .
bad,"Management honestly sucks at the Front end of the store, and the back end. The store i work at has a total of ten Managers, only three of them are decent enough to work with. The others are honestly bad when it comes to treating associates like people. Out of the 5 head cashiers, three of them are great. "
bad,"Management needs to improve skills to interact with employees, and each other.  Communication among managers and supervisors is practically non-existent.  Too much competition."
bad,"Frequently pressured to finish truck without offering help"
bad,"Sh1tty place to work. It was fun a few years ago but with the new ceo hes just turning it into a knock off home depot. + The pay isnt worth it, not to mention the horrible customers"
bad,If you wanna be a stocker loader or unloader at this place you will be very sad and just hated on. most the management will not care about you they just want their money
bad,"It no longer feels like family. No one is held accountable. Tenure means nothing. Pride has been thrown out the window. All they want is the dollar bill. Whatever the customer says has got to be the truth. Liars, thieves and cons are ruling the business. All you have to do is ask for a manager. You will get whatever you want for free."
bad,"I took this job because I needed it. I am a BSN college grad.  The quality of management is laughable.  They don't know how to work the facility, and they just bark orders.  Sucks because I invested in Lowes stock.  Little room for advancement, and if you do... Lowe's will ""restructure"" and fire you as a manager."
bad,"They dont care if your 4'11 or 6'2 , you do the same work. Which is Not cool if your a unloader. No repect given by management, pretty much laugh in your face. Doesnt matter if you complain or not, your not put into account. Your told to get over it, even if you're hurt or not feeling well. But they do pay for training."
bad,"I got training there to operate stocking vehicles & was usually on the truck doing delivery. Some of the mangers/supervisors were cool but others you could barely talk to with them giving no friendly sense, same with employees. I would of stayed longer till a female employee decided to get me fired over a conversation."
bad,"I love my coworkers. They‚Äôre easy to get along with and all with their own cute little quirks that i adore. Great place to work if you‚Äôre in school. Great pay not to mention the benefits for a part time employee. "
bad,"Seems like the store manager got a bonus for keeping labor hours low. Therefore store was run with a lean staff and if an associate was at lunch or even helping someone else you could not get an answer to help a customer. "
bad,"I started as a seasonal cashier and quickly got hired on as permanent part time customer service and got a decent pay raise in that time. I eventually moved up to full time Head Cashier and stayed in that role for over a year. I was continuously given closing shifts and the rotation that all head cashiers were supposed to be on was never used. I enjoyed learning new things, like how to work in other departments such as paint and inside garden but I never got any compensation for learning new skills to help the store. Continuously covered lunch breaks for other departments while missing my own lunch a lot of the time. Management definitely picked favorites and there was not a lot of room for advancement after working on the front end even after cross training. I enjoyed working at Lowe‚Äôs for the first year or so and stayed just because of the people I had met and the pay was pretty fair in the beginning for the amount of work I was doing. After basically managing the front end due to lazy (or overworked) management, I expected to be making more than I was. If upper management had stayed the same, I would still be working with the company. New management expects too much for what they are willing to give. At my particular store, a lot of them were very rude and demeaning to employees and customers."
bad,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's until they changed managers and everything changed. Days that I requested off way ahead of time got denied for no reason. Did not feel like I mattered in the slightest
bad,"Face paced , steady working environment which can get heroic and or overwhelming in and around peak seasons. Must be willing to deal with the elements of outdoor work"
bad,"There are many great people who work here, but there are many issues with upper management and corporate. The store manager is hot headed and asks too much from his employees with unrealistic expectations and yells at them when they don't complete their tasks which can not be achieved in the time allotted.  Corporate has cut 5000 hours from the employees at my store to try and improve profits. This comes at a time when many of the university students that work here are graduating and quitting their positions at the store. The work force is stretched so thin that entire departments are having to be neglected to cover sore services. This is not how you provide proper customer service or how you treat your employees."
bad,Dont fall in love with lowes. In time they will show their corporate colors. Best to become a department manager and ask for $25 an hour. It can be done. Dont get low balled.
bad,Have to cover several different departments policy changes yearly new hour change in affect overtime is only approved when needed other then that 40 hours at best several lazy associates that either sit at a desk or talk then work so you have to cover their department then at the end of the night not only do your work but shift to that department as well don‚Äôt get compensated for what‚Äôs really done based on hourly rate I do at least five jobs daily an get paid for one
bad,"Most of the managers lack the knowledge and drive to be in their current position. There is little to no discipline for the day crew, and hardly any actual work ever gets done."
bad,Always evolving work place. Implemented training but not followed. This is a sink or swim environment from the day you start. Tools given to succeed: Concrete shoes and no life preserver. Good Luck!
bad,Much like most retail positions it was filled with people who were mainly there for the paycheck. While management tried to make it seem like they cared it was obvious they didnt.
bad,its fine to work for a while but it wears you down. there is also no form of training and you just have to learn as you work. most parts are not bad though but i cant see myself doing it forever.
bad,"The managers were very good and fair, they appreciated hard work. The work was fairly easy with some tasks that did need a little more knowledge than others"
bad,I didn't like the vibe at the work place. I didn't have any training . I felt like that they jus put me out there to fail . And It wasn't fair at all .
bad,"Would not recommend going into delivery if you are going to work at lowes. You get paid the same as a cashier to do the same job as a delivery driver without getting paid the same. Very good benefits but every time I asked for a raise I would get the same response of, maybe or if its possible. If you're going to work at Lowes just get a job on the front end where you can stand around if you don't want to have a bad back by the age of 25."
bad,"Check freight on pallets at beginning of shift to begin working certain  departments Tools,Seasonal .Plumbing, Electrical etc.... Use Star wars. Ballymore. or Order picker for heavy freight and put away in Top stock "
bad,"I went out on work comp. I came back to work after a handful of months. Upon returning, hr informed me that my benefits would pick right back up. Nope, they didn‚Äôt.  And they told me I‚Äôd have to wait for signing up for insurance. Sign up was only once a year, around September or October. This all happened in March. So glad I‚Äôm not there anymore."
bad,Management needs a huge improvement.  Workplace culture is essentially wait for someone else to do it with no repercussions. The average day is fairly easy Just don't show ambition or you will be taken advantage of
bad,low pay for the work that was accomplished and very inconsistent hours. Due to management changes power hours were implemented which meant you were not allowed to run power equipment or stock shelves just stand around and wait for a customer to show up from 10-2 daily. Not all departments were manned for the duration the store was open therefore you had to leave your area to cover other areas leaving your area without customer service.
bad,I worked for Lowe's for about a month in the summer of 2018 which for the most part I would have enjoyed as much as I did while working for home depot 3 years prior. If it was not for a severe cut in hours I would most likely be still working there at the moment but management decided to cut me down too 15.5-17 hours per week at the start of august while still wanting me to come in for 5 shifts a week.
bad,"Working as a Customer Service Associate at Lowe's can be easy enough and people who work there are mostly pleasant. HR is helpful and while you don't get paid more than minimum wage you do get paid extra for Civic holidays which I don't think is mandatory. Some departments are very understaffed and overworked, and some seemed like they never had anything to do."
bad,"I have worked at Lowe's for about a year and a half now and I feel that through what I have put forth for this company, I don't get much in return. I feel that out of all the times I've helped all of my co-workers out with covering shifts to be able to get more hours for myself, but heaven forbid if I need someone to help me out. As far as the workplace is concerned, I don't get paid enough to deal with all of the griping customers that come across me and I'm always patronized for everything I do in the workplace. I have to put on a facade just to get along with people because I'm scared that if they see me for who I really am, nobody will respect me then. It's a vicious cycle for every single day I work there. The sad fact is, I've talked to the head managers about it and they do nothing. Sadly, this is the best job I can find around my area with my level of experience. It's sad to say that nothing will change with the foreseeable future."
bad,"Tremendous lack of hands on training, all completed on computer, no time given to work with seasoned employee to gain knowledge. Very Antiquated inventory software with know written instruction or guidelines to follow. You must learn the best way you can from another employee who may have the time to show you."
bad,"Lowes is a nice place to start off working for high school or college students. "
bad,Not a lot of guidance at the facility I worked at. I was told to do something and not given the proper tools or equipment to perform the required task.
bad,"Agr√©able coll√®gue de travail et environnement."
bad,never enough help. increasingly stressful work environment. Management performs stock boy duties. Good mix of employees. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get to all people that need help. I certainly enjoy a successful sales day
bad,Terrible training programs. Basically sent out after a few pointless common sense videos and expected to be a professional/ expert in whatever department they put you in. And if you you help it is usually not there or won't be for so long that the customer gets frustrated and leaves.
bad,"This was once a great place to work. You can put in work with customer and your duties with other co workers. However now you can be out the door even if you are, a hard worker."
bad,"Major cutbacks, hard to transfer departments, great people to work with but Lowe's itself was running a skeleton crew, kept losing people because of management and staffing issues.  To many overwhelmed with lack of help and support, expected to do things on their own when a two person team was necessary."
bad,During my time at Lowe's i constantly had to work with other employees to fix problems that could have been averted if they had done their job correctly. Poor management is likely the culprit behind their high turnover rate in employees. All of the friends i made during my time at Lowe's no longer work there.
bad,"Very good benefits, pay increases and generally alright work. However, the company is becoming more and more cash focused every day, and it shows. Employees are being shafted so that Lowe's can stack more piles of money in their coffers. At a more personal level, my particular Lowe's is a mixed bag of bad. Near constant workplace drama between the men and women, the break room is always filled with talking behind other employee's backs. Management pretends to care, but while everybody else is scraping by with poor hours and stressful mismanagement, they're throwing daily pizza parties and Chinese takeout meals for themselves. Rude, loud, uncaring customers are coddled and rewarded for their vileness with discounts and superior service. "
bad,Job was a lot of work not worth the money would not recommend anyone going their to start a career I didn‚Äôt like the job personally don‚Äôt plan on going back
bad,"The store is very busy, but the Delivery Department is constantly understaffed.Vehicles are poorly maintained and often break down. GPS devices are out of date and delivery drivers have to use their own phones in order to locate delivery addresses. The management disregards the above facts and pushes the number of deliveries which results in long days, and frequent ""call-outs"" from overworked delivery crew members. Employees are encouraged to complain about others."
bad,Management does not unify leadership. Different managers will have you doing different tasks in a disorganized manner and will hold you accountable for their failure in leadership. If you work in any department other than the garden center you will be hilariously under staffed and over tasked.
bad,"Lowe's is retail.  It pays better than most retail spots and it does offer competitive benefits for the retail industry however, never forget that it is retail before it is any other industry.  You're schedule is tied to a matrix--but you'll be closing one night and opening the next morning.  They have high turnover so stores are consistently undermanned.  Management is usually set up to fail so most of them end up working more than their allotted 50 hours a week doing floor associate work rather than managing.  There is a corporate effort to change how management is treated and it will be interesting to see how that develops.  Corporate also likes to emphasize the Lowe's team.  Lowe's software is awful.  Plain awful.  There are four systems that a cabinet's specialist has to access on a daily basis.  They don't work together very well and frequently you're finding work arounds to compensate for them not communicating with each other. You'll spend a couple hours a day working around the software."
bad,The managers show favoritism. They are unfair about different policies with specific people. There is a serious lack in professionalism. Cashiers are forced to perform the duties of parking lot attendants.
bad,Loved the job. I was let go because Lowe's has a different points program than the DMV. Overall the people I worked with were great. It's a shame to see the good ones go without any chance.
bad,"Managers only care about the high people in the company but not there employees. There's barely any diversity at Lowe's I currently work at. They didn't transfer me when I asked so, currently, I might lose my job. The employees are wonderful people to work with but they don't treat them right some will get away with a lot and some work very hard and never appreciated."
bad,"Greet customers, see if they need any assistance with anything. Flatten the lumber to look neat for customer eyes as well as the manager. Use the forklift when needed if the customer is getting something like bulk sand ‚Äú1,000 pounds‚Äù or a lot of lumber"
bad,"Its decent if you can afford a low salary. The benefits are nice, but the pay is on the low side. Advancement isnt the easiest thing to do either, i think its a good starting job."
bad,"In my first 3 months working for Lowe's I had 3 different service managers.  These are managers that oversee multiple departments as opposed to just a single department as was customary only 6 months ago.  This transition has been unseccessful and numerous inefficiencies have arisen.  It is clear the Lowe's is not concerned about customer service, just money.  Cuts in staffing hierarchy gives more work to fewer people and fewer opportunities for advancement.  There is currently no future in working for Lowe's."
bad,"Lowe's has many benefits including fair pay, affordable insurance, paid maternity leave and quarterly compensation among many other wonderful benefits.  However, most of the time the store is understaffed and employees are expected to make up for that.  Equipment needed to help customers is often scarce and/or in poor condition.  I never received an annual evaluation in 18 months of employment.  The training process is almost non-existent which can make it very frustrating when helping customers.  Corporate rotation requires all employees (even managers) to close and open each week, no exceptions, so there is no way for employees to have a consistent work time.  Daily procedures are inefficient and outdated.  Managers have so many obligations that they have no time to deal with specific issues that directly effect customers and employees. "
bad,"My availability was completely disregarded when the schedule was being put together. "
bad,"Several company-wide meetings per week insured that every employee understood sales goals and other priorities of store management."
bad,"this job is strenuous in 2 ways, having to hurry up and get loaded and be gone by 8 am and delivering the appliances. Its unorganized"
bad,"Development is in the eye of the beholder. Accountability is scarce leading to the workload being enhanced for the leaders and managers attempting to succeed. The most enjoyable aspect was easily the privilege of developing associates and enhancing their role within the company. The hardest part was the politics and attempting to stay in favor, as falling out of favor within the culture at any given store could cost you your career."
bad,"working at Lowes enforced my public speaking skills, promoting special sales and being able to work and solve problems individually. lowes has good benefit but the hours throughout the week vary making having a social life very hard outside of work."
bad,"They will work you until you burn out if you let them. They allow the lazy and disinterested continue to put forth minimal effort while anyone who puts forth extra effort has more work piled onto them until you can't keep up."
bad,I started working there and disliked it because apparently a head cashier did not like me from the beginning so she started gossiping about me and trying to get me fired any way she could. i ended up leaving because i got very sick off my migraines.
bad,Management needed a definite kick in the butt.  I don't think any of them had a clue what was going on with in there own respective departments.  They could be friendly but only if there was an agenda.
bad,"I prefer not to fill this portion out. I spent more than 15 years employed here and have left on a sour note. Many things were great about making this a career, some things were not so great."
bad,"Always a lot to do. Retail is very busy work. Not just customer service but making sure you have everything a customer will need when they come in. So in turn there is always something to do. I learn a lot working there by asking question, talking to customers and contractors. Management seems to be too busy to train those coming into the position. If you are with the company any length of time, they assume you already know what you are doing. The associates on the floor give each other a lot of support. Some of the store even have a feeling of being part of a family. The worst part of all my years was this last restructure due to corporate letting a lot of experience and hard working people go. The moral was deeply scared.  I have worked with some wonderful people through the years and I had really enjoyed it."
bad,"Been with Lowes a while and have worked in 3 stores. have been full time for 1.6 years. transferred back to Parkersburg from west Chester Ohio to help my dad out around the house, all the had available was seasonal. so I took a full time seasonal position as a loader. lost 1.5 an hour in the transfer and I keep arguing about why I keep getting part time hours. In a different store I was asked by managers to assist other departments since I was one of 5 people who could operate all the power equipment.  then would get into trouble for my department not being clean. and I was 1 of 5 employees in the department and the other 4 had limited and restricted schedules for school. I DO NOT recommend this company."
bad,Management just runs into each other with different sets of instructions. I learned hoe to use a forklift and narrow aisle reach truck.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with management and the most enjoyable is talking with other floor level associates.
bad,You just got to make the best out of every job. I just wish there was more advancement. And higher pay would be nice. For experiences and also for how much work you doing all the time.. also paid days off would be great. Full-time positions are not available which is not good.
bad,Some managers need to learn the have to actually be managers instead of just putting them in the positions But as long as they let u do your job but then there is those managers that have a big ego
bad,No employee vetting resulting in workers with terrible work ethic. Incompetent workers. Lack of progressive discipline for workers with poor job performance.
bad,Poor employee appreciation. General manager is delusional. Not enough employees. Racing around like a chicken with your head cut off. No real time for breaks. Parties are laid out with minimal food and rewards. Store meetings held at 6 am.
bad,"Stock room not organized properly and merchandise often damaged; runs expected to begin at closest point to the store instead of farthest point made the end of the day extremely difficult; job was misrepresented from the beginning as a ""driver"" position, not a deliver, haul it up 4 flights-of-stairs in the snow and kill yourself hauling their old one out, position; trucks were never loaded on time in the morning so runs could begin on time and end at a decent time of day .... this went on every ... single .... day.... ad nauseum"
bad,Systems are always malfunctioning the time they expect a phone. The way they count days against you is unnecessary I just don't care to much for how this company runs there business and they lose a lot of customer due to system issues and miscommunication
bad,Management is not the best at this store. I loved my customers and the people I worked with. If the management could pull it together then I would definitely recommend Lowes to anyone!
bad,"Management is very biased and untrustworthy. Do your work and go home. They want a ""family oriented"" environment but it's the complete opposite. Benefits are good, pay is decent but be careful what you do and say around staff."
bad,"if like to be creative in building and decorating this place can be good for ideas, it can be fun in times some locations can have really good and cooperative effort to help you if need more training"
bad,"Lowe's is love/hate thing to me. It is an enjoyable job and wonderful and fun co-workers, but that is overshadowed by a lot of poor management. There are some who will come to help in a situation that they are needed. But most of the time, you can call or page and no one comes, but if you go look, you'll go to the back and find them hanging out in the training room, or one of the offices....just talking and usually eating as well. If it was possible to get these members of management to practice what they preach, it would be a much better place to work....by that I mean take care of the customer. Also, they have a better starting wage but are notorious for knocking people's hours down to nothing when business is slower which not only hurts their employees but hurts the customer because they is no coverage."
bad,The Lowes I worked for the store manAger was very unfair. He had favorites and his store was mismanaged. He had alot of great employees but didn't know how to do his job.  Almost all the employees have moved on to other companies. Even employees that have worked there for 14 years or more. That shows the lack of management.
bad,"It is a demanding job with heavy lifting.  The swing hours will wear you down but there is a fun side also.  You have the Voice Team and Safety Team which is a nice outlet and you can be heard.  "
bad,Lowe's zis a decent company. Problems open up at a store level. Favoritism is a serious problem at store level. Employees are not viewed on a preformece basis.
bad,I would recommend working at Lowes because they have great benefits. It is a very easy job and you have a great pay rate. The management was great. But there were a lot of codes to remember for cashiering which was stressful.
bad,Management doesn‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing & they play favorites. It got to the point where I regretted working there. But some of the people were nice & made it sorta fun
bad,"If you have kids, they don't care if you need specific days off for a visitation schedule. They expect you to request those days off, and then will turn around and deny your request regardless of how ahead of time you post it, then they expect you to ask a coworker to switch your shift. They have zero urgency to train their employees on any power equipment, they also will schedule an employee that doesn't have a power equipment license alone in a department that requires one. No common sense when it comes to schedule making."
bad,"Depending on the time the shift starts. Check email, put up stock, work an number of reports, waiting on customers, ect.... Learned team building skills, Product knowledge, & store processes. Workplace culture changed over the years. Definitely no support for knowledgeable & tenor employees. Hardest part of the job was making a decisions & getting in trouble for making that decision. Most enjoyable part of the job was customers being happy with there projects."
bad,"Could be let go at anytime,your a fist in a bucket of water."
bad,12+ hour days are common. Moving very heavy appliances on a regular basis up lots of steps with poorly maintained equipment. As a driver you get a helper. They range from very helpful to not being able to lift 20 lbs. or reverse a fridge door. Incomplete tool set. Unresponsive mngt. to employee concerns. Unsafe trucks/liftgates. Nonexistent work/life balance. Forced to work rotating days off which results in having to work 6-7 days in a row. Hourly rate was lower than it should be given the amount of wear and tear on the body but with overtime (you WILL get it whether you wanted it or not) it made for some nice paychecks. Management is very easygoing on making mistakes and accommodating you in emergency situations. They have a STRONG belief in providing outstanding customer service. Most days you will have to load/unload your own truck. Never know from day to day when you will be done so it's virtually impossible to plan anything after work. Not to mention that you'll be so tired by the end you want to do anything. Good job for teens for 6 months. Not for an adult male providing for his family.
bad,"There is a lack of managers who actually manage people.  Managers are too busy managing processes that they do not have time to supervise personnel.  If one posesses a high work ethic, you will tire yourself out daily while others stand around and become ""blood clots.""  By blood clots I mean 2 or 3 stand around in red vest in some aisle of the store and gossip while the workers wear themselves out.  This is not a result of store managers ineptitude, they just do not have time to supervise people.  Managers are busy at managing processes, merchandising, cycle counting, etc.. If one has no work ethic, by all means get a job there you will be happy and do fine  Just be a syncophant to the bosses and they will not have time to find out that you are a lazy bum.  But if you are a hard worker, there will never be any reward for the contribution that you make."
bad,"The company started off amazing to work for, after few years everything started going down hill. Got new changes to help out the company but it didn't help at all, only made things worse."
bad,I loved working at lowes for the first 4 years i worked there. However things changed MAJORLY within the last 9 months of my employment with them. I left on my own accord because I could no longer take the poor management and the unprofessional behavior of the management staff.
bad,"Customers were the highlight of the day, you would have some loyal customers who would only take help from you. The co workers were great and knowledgeable in almost every department in the store so it made it easy to learn the job."
bad,"Great Company to work for, excellent benefits and discounts but store manager had no clue what she was doing. Only way to advance was to kiss butt and be a robot. Store 1946 in Portland Maine has the worst store manager Jen Favreau is terrible. Uses bully tactics and will tell you one thing and do another. She has no personality and treats her employees like garbage...not all Lowes are like this but the Portland Maine store is. And i am not a disgruntled employee writing a bad review, I left the company on my own after 8 years with them because of the POOR store management at this location"
bad,"After the restructure of management there are fewer employees and managers to assist customers."
bad,"I've worked for this company for 19 years. It was great the first 10 years, but now the insurance is costly, my pay is stymied, there is no job security, and nothing is ever good enough. Lowes has made it increasingly difficult to survive--let alone thrive."
bad,"Easy money.  Doesn't matter how much you work, management doesn't care. You are shunned if you work too hard. Quite a bit of favoritism as well. Great work hours."
bad,Good company until 2007 and then they got greedy. They could care less about the employees. I miss my co-workers and how they made me feel like part of a family. Lowe's as a company though does not care so it really does not matter. I could write a book about all my adventures at Lowe's.
bad,"At Lowe's, there are some great people who work and care about there job. There are also, those who don't care and continue to work there b/c there is no accountability. These associates outnumber the former because Management doesn't train them properly nor hold them accountable for their many mistakes. Therefore, mistakes pile up & up & up with customers becoming frustrated & the store becoming more & more likely to concede monetary compensation."
bad,"If they like you then there's nothing you can do wrong, but if they don't then it doset matter how hard you work you will be treated badly, as well as if you work hard they make you do other people's jobs instead of having the person they hierd do it even if they are there. The lower management plays favorite with employees if your there friend then you get hour and are pressured to actually do your job. There are many employees that are so compulsively late that they changed there seduale to acomidate them and they still don't show up on time and they just change there there clock in time. But for others if you are late once you get written up for it. There is no loyalty among the employees and if there is then you and the other person are treated as back sheep."
bad,"I understand that the retail marketplace is changing and that companies have to adapt to survive, but this company is going about it incorrectly.  Instead of ne ideas, they are taking ideas from competitors and trying to make them work in their own way.  So far it has not been a success."
bad,"Would have to train people who would rather socialize then learn. Then have to conduct corrective action when they don't meet the standards. Then fire them. Then HR would replace them with even worse people. Repeat"
bad,"Most of the associate are fun to work with only mangers and sales specialist made the day difficult, for they wanted you to do your job and theirs also."
bad,"Received job threw OOD and did not have a coach in house after 90 days.  Management refused to update inventory control system and how they stay afloat is beyond me.  Customers have old data that is embarrassing for employee's to work with.  The software is already paid for yet they refuse to use it, just because it's old and nobody upstairs wants to pay a dime to update data.  Sad really sad."
bad,"I could not stand retail. I was selling items in Plmg department that I do not believe should have been sold to the public. Anything involving gas hookup, should be installed by plumber ."
bad,"associates i have come to know are friendly. managers tend to be judgemental. rules that they want to set out for some,where they make allowances for others. in other words favoritism. i have worked basicly in the same role for seventeen years and i am pretty tired of no advancement. i never really know how secure my position is. i can go on and on laying out the negative aspects but it is a job.that is why i plan to start school i do not plan on being there much longer."
bad,People that work there are good people. Typical day can be pretty chaotic. Management is not organized and effects the efficiency of work. Culture is good if implemented. Enjoyable part of the job is creating relationships with customers. The hardest part is the lack of a solid goal.
bad,"Lowes is a productive area to work. "
bad,Management has shifted drastically. Room for advancement depending on location. Hardest part is finding additional associates or management for assistance.
bad,It was great in the beginning but recent reorganizations have created a hostile environment. Hopefully the changes will produce the results they wanted but it has damaged customer service in the stores and the company's ability to take care of their customers overall.
bad,"Couldn't recommend Lowe's as a good place to work at this time. Environment unstable and very stressful.  "
bad,"Performance is the primary care of Lowe's even though they always say safety is their primary concern. If you do not make performance, no matter how much work you do, or how much you out preform other. They will let you go as soon as there is an opportunity to do so."
bad,"Typical work day consisted of pulling orders for outgoing deliveries, informing customers of delivery time frame via phone call,loading truck for delivery, driving company box truck to job sites usually located in a customers home in order to lift, place, and install household appliances or other store product. I would perform a daily vehicle inspection report (DVIR) at the end of each shift and fill out the required paperwork for invoice processing and material returns."
bad,"A typical day at work:  Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.  Help a customer, and back to doing more paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.  Oh hey, one of the many store managers on duty has just given you more paperwork, and asks ""Why haven't you finished the paperwork from this morning?"""
bad,"Clueless in role, no support, condescending, micro-manager. I left the company due to an incompetent, lazy, manager that skated by on their support managers hard work. Not a leader in any form."
bad,Management doesn't seem to give a hoot about the emplyoees. They count ansences that include dr notes against you. Extremely short staffed and leaves everyone overworked.
bad,"The customer is always right here. No matter what you do to help them out, no matter how many forms or papers you have them sign, no matter what is said or documented, if the customer has an issue with their order it is your fault 100%. "
bad,"some employees know where things are in the store most do not and do not care about the clenliness of the store or any department but their own.every department thinks their deparment matters and no other, the managers dont keep up knowing their staff, the hr manager didnt care enough about anything to make sure i got my benifits after 3 months of me being there"
bad,"Long term strategy vision is missing and weak leadership."
bad,"The company is changing to much way to fast . They will always play catch up to home depot. very good  pay ,benefits are ok. I started here to make a career ,but quickly learned their is no career left in lowes without knowing some on the corporate level"
bad,"I have nothing to say, this is a job.  You work to make money for the company and it is very clear this is what they want you to do.  I have nothing more to say."
bad,"In my first 3 months working for Lowe's I had 3 different service managers.  These are managers that oversee multiple departments as opposed to just a single department as was customary only 6 months ago.  This transition has been unseccessful and numerous inefficiencies have arisen.  It is clear the Lowe's is not concerned about customer service, just money.  Cuts in staffing hierarchy gives more work to fewer people and fewer opportunities for advancement.  There is currently no future in working for Lowe's."
bad,Lowes is taking away all full time employees cutting all management positions along with all positions that pay decent. Their goal is to reduces all well paid employees to new part time low paid people
bad,Just like any other out of state corporate ran company. Management has no control of decision making power. In my honest opinion Lowes needs to do some home repair on itself.
bad,"When I originally started at Lowe's, it was an excellent company to work for. As time went on, new management arrived, good employees went out the door, and bad employees came in. It may have been situational to my store but it was no longer a happy workplace."
bad,I have been with Lowes for 5+ years and loved working here until recently. The changes this year have created uncertainty and loss of confidence in our management due to lack of support and clear future direction.
bad,"I walk in the door to issues that needed to be resolved that could have been handled in my absence but was not addressed in a timely manner. Would have to resolve the issue  and calm down a customer who is angry because of the delay."
bad,"Company consistently has layoffs, doesn't seem like a consistent plan is in place to manage the workforce efficiently.  It get's bloated every couple of years and then they have a round or two of layoffs."
bad,"Imagine a place that could be a great place to work, with decent pay, and a great benefit package, but is so poorly managed that it makes working there miserable for everybody, outside of the inner-circle of management, that bands together to do as little as possible. Performance punishment is the standard, meaning that if you're a hard worker, responsibility and extra duties are dumped on you regularly. While if you're a poor worker who works hard at not working, you're not held accountable for the things that you do."
bad,"I liked my job, but there is no way to move up if your not one of the favorites. I did my job and whatever was asked of me and others got promotions who stood around and did nothing."
bad,"I have spent many years at Lowe's and have been through the good and the bad with the company. Unfortunately, the good times are long gone with this company. They have caved in and are like most other retailers when it comes to taking care of employees.  The benefits are ok, probably better than a lot of places. The management teams are under educated and overwhelmed. Stores are understaffed with no relief in site. A new staffing model has made thing even worse. And of course there is the retail schedule. You can work any hours any days, no set schedules."
bad,"The work here is fine, is very busy in the summer and slows down a bit in the winter. But the culture is not great, too many firings and walkouts to be a reliable, good place, it would be hard to recommend this store."
bad,"Lowe's pays the bills but isn't too terribly enjoyable to work at."
bad,"Worked at the store on 83rd very shorty, the trainer a butch that kept drama up, so glad I'm no longer there, Snakes were every were. Couldn't trust no one."
bad,I was glad I was only seasonal because the managers that were there when I was were unfair and did not treat employees correctly. they were very unprofessional there unfourtenly. I don't know what it is like now but I would never go back there for a job.
bad,"Lowes was a great place to work at until they changed up the management tree nationwide, fired people with more experience than the managers themselves have. This is now a last resort type of place."
bad,"Really nice store manager and for most part everyone you work with is pretty nice and helpful. Downside drama, schedule sucks work alone and weekends are crazy. Breaks aren't for sure do to customers and no one to help out. Basic retail angry people get mad at you cause they can't find that one thing they need."
bad,i worked here for almost 2 years and because I could not do multiple peoples jobs because we were so short staffed I was let go so if you cant do multiple people jobs I would not apply to this
bad,"Pretty terrible place to work overall.  I basically had to stock 3-5 different departments depending on how big the truck was and who wasn't there.  Job was early morning 3am to whenever you got done and it was mon-fri"
bad,"i have no good things to say about the work, And management doesn't care about anything that doesn't deal with lowes. "
bad,I would go into work at 4am Monday through Friday and leave at 8am. I unloaded trucks and stocked merchandise. If customers came into the store that early and needed help I would help them.
bad,They would say that do to budget cuts that they have to lay people off. No one's job is safe even if you work their for years. Only a seasonal job. look for something better
bad,"The culture and team oriented relationships have greatly changed over the past 20yrs. The management (many are good people) has really gone downhill. Selection of these positions are often chosen based on friendships rather than qualifications. This makes the working environment unnecessarily hostile in some cases due to the lack of leadership. Basically, to many ""should be"" leaders making bad decisions thus causing the lack in quality direction. This in turn shows in the ROI for the company and ultimately soft numbers and loss of sales at the core levels."
bad,the environments is very unclean and every weather elements is inside the store. Birds are flying inside the stores and mice are running under racks and desk. Not a good place for a person who has allergies or asthma..
bad,"My experience in Lowe's was not pleasant but that was more due to the incompetency of our manager than anything else, it doesn't help that there was only 3 people to stock the entire store."
bad,"Lowe's is a good company to either get your foot in the door or spend retirement. They don't expect much out of you and as far as supervision, there really is none. This is both good and bad. If you're looking for recognition you will not find it as management doesn't notice. Likewise if you just want to come in, punch a clock and help a few customers you're in good graces too. Work isn't difficult or challenging but the day can go by slow unless you stay busy. Management is nowhere to be found except in the warehouse or the office. Sometimes they will answer the phone if you call the number enough. For the most part you are left to your own devices if you run into a problem or talk to a peer."
bad,"Typical days at Lowes required you work 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week.  The company goes through restructuring a lot. They change things every few years, causing people to lose jobs because the eliminate the position. Management was good, a lot was learned, and everyone was very helpful."
bad,"As a young adult looking to advance within the company into a more stable position, I find it hard to rate this company as a place to work. As great as the people are, I seem to have been blocked for one reason or another in advancing my position from part-time into full-time."
bad,"Check to see what deliveries are scheduled to come into the store,"
bad,"you will have a stable job; as far as promotions, politics are involved among management and associates. The pay is average around 13 dollars an hour. when it comes to co-workers, if you have a good workers acting like team players, you will have a good working environment. If you have unproductive individuals, this will make your experience at lowes very difficult. the hardest part of the job is when lowes is under staff. the management team will make to you double the work you usually do."
bad,"very rigid way of thinking. doesn't do well with individual ideas or thinking. Like going back to high school, very petty and clicky co workers. Those that don't aspire to work get promoted, and those that do work get insulted."
bad,Started out part time with 30+hrs and was promised to keep that or be given full time. Now my hours have been drastically reduced while incompetent employees continue with their schedule. Management needs those payroll bonuses...
bad,"wouldn't necessarily recommend unless its your first job, staff are amazing however management is a bit disconnected with staff, it is a very boring job and short shifts are only given which is disappointing."
bad,"The Job as a whole was easy."
bad,"typical day: lots of customer traffic, put away freight monday, wednesday, friday mornings with little to no help. top stock, down stock, do paperwork for managers. "
bad,"I started at about $14.12 an hour and I was licensed for every forklift, moffett, order picker, and any heavy equipment in the store and they love to keep your pay low. It was fun but pay was low. "
bad,"When I started with Lowe's I thought it was a great. They cared about their employees and took care of them, Now they only care about the numbers and treat you like a number also."
bad,New management were a disappointment having no time for employees and terminating old staff for Hendersonville staff. Inventory and Department Managing were good learning experiences. No help with limited staff and untrained coworkers hurt sales. I had no joy with job this term.
bad,Cold calls and sales of Automobiles. Greet and serve there needs  for dependable transportation. While offering great value
bad,"Working for Lowes was great mostly.  The department managers are pretty good, the upper management wasn't that great.  Money was good for the work done."
bad,"Fast paced, good benefits, hard to advance in the company if you haven't been there very long. But overall Lowe's is a good company to work for although some job positions get paid lesser than higher positions that truly do not do nothing all day."
bad,"Lowes is a good place to work at only if all moving pieces are on the same page but just like anywhere else you will have personnel within the company that are toxic and not willing to help others, but its all about morale and leadership to change that and make it a fun safe place to come to work confrontational free."
bad,"People who work here stay here for life, there are no opportunities to further your career here. The manager had me jumping through hoops promising a manager position and a pay raise but kept giving the job to someone else"
bad,"The overall job was great working with the general public seeing new faces each day. Management I believe needed to have a better handle on their schedules to provide better customer service. My co-workers in general were fun to work with . The hardest part of the entire job was being able to find management when there was an issue for a customer ,the wait time was horrible."
bad,Lowes has excellent people - the engineers and staff work and do a lot given the workloads thrust upon them. The main problem at Lowes is there has been so much change in senior leadership it is difficult getting a grasp on what your responsibilities are from quarter to quarter.
bad,Since i have started working at Lowe's i have learned how to handle rude customers and management.  When i first started working here it was not as bad . The hardest part of my job is that i am dealing with so many different personalities and i do not receive enough hours. However the most enjoyable part of the job is that i learn a lesson every time i am at work.
bad,This job pays well for customer service.  It is a revolving door with employees that work there and it is difficult to keep everyone properly trained and knowledgeable on the product.  The more an employee knows the more they are asked to do.  Also after working there for a year i have a total of 0 performance reviews.
bad,"Working at Lowes consumes your life. I worked swing shifts. I got one weekend off a month. I had to work 2.5 weeks to get 2 days off in a row. I love working with people but, I would like a job that I have more family time."
bad,Depending on the location you could end up with a good team or equally bad one. Bad associates tend to stick around and the better one leave. The management teams hardly do what they promise or say they are. Firing a person with attendance problems takes over 3 months because its like a 80 strike rule.
bad,"I was a customer service associate in the lumber department. I greeted every customer that came into the lumber department by providing great customer service and by advising them on what product to purchase for their home improvement projects. Management was very helpful in every department. Co-workers all had a healthy relationship between one another, making it an overall productive work environment."
bad,Lack of caring in the company i worked part time there in a store an hours ride from my house i askde if i could be trasfered to a closer store they told me no. So i basicly worked for gas money to get to work and back
bad,Great job for talented individuals with previous experience.
bad,I work graveyard shifts in the morning four days a week. I must say for the amount of work we put into doesnt match our pay rate. VERY low staff poeple quit left and right. Other employees are asked to help and they move items in different spots making our job harder because they dont want to do anything. Other departments get paid $15 an hour for standing around socializing for 8hrs. Supervisor sits in back hides out while we do all the work and yells at us to get things done faster so he has less work. Cant move departments because lowes keeps stockers on lockdown with stocker department. No room for advancement.
bad,"Senior Management are very approachable."
bad,"I loved working with the people I did, but your life outside of work is basically killed.  The hours are all over the place and days off are not regular. "
bad,"Typical work day. 6am to 3 pm"
bad,They do not take your family life into acct in any way shape or form when you are a salaried manager. Your expected to work 60 plus hours a week and sometimes more with no remorse for anything you have going on outside of the store. You on days off and vacation are expected to call in and answer emails and phone calls and if you done there are repercussions. This is the expectation .
bad,"good place to work but takes forever for a promotion "
bad,Wouldn't refer anyone to apply to rules that contradict one another and a lack management and wages.
bad,Not my kind of work. Its very labor intensive and you top out max pay very quicl with no room to increase. Other than your bonus. To move up in the company is hard as well.
bad,"They will teach you what you do not know."
bad,"A day at work involves doing my job, 100% to expectations, though the management in the company is messed up, i don't allow that to effect my attitude, as i give 100% WOW Customer Service"
bad,A typical day would be kind of slow because my uncle owned that store and he would receive shipments from there. I learned how to make sales. Management was okay but he was really rough at times. The hardest part of the job was that it would be slow at times and it would be cold and we didn't have breaks that much.I got to have a lot of conversations and i could sit outside and enjoy the sun a little bit
bad,"Great people work at estrablishment, but not in the right positions. No mentoring or helpful advice on ways to advance in company, even when showing high desire."
bad,"Lowes was a fun place to work with a variety of people that were friendly to work with. Management changed and unless you were a pretty young girl, it was hard to advance. Left before it got worse. Store manager is a pervert. HR will fire you if you are not fake like her."
bad,"I am an independent, hard worker person. My priority is help customers and maintain the department. I would love the opportunity to advance in my career."
bad,"Not a professional place."
bad,This company cares more about numbers then their employees. It is a job not a career. Everyone can be replaced.
bad,"I completed reports, inventory replenishment, internet orders, cycle counts, customer service and I assisted customers. The management was inconsistent, did not communicate well with one another nor did they communicate well with their Department Managers."
bad,"Workng at the distribution center would be a great place to work were it not for the gestapo-esque policies they enforce. They seem more interested in getting people in trouble for the most minor thngs than they do operating the facility. That mans people who work hard and try to do a good job are constantly being run off over petty things, while people who do nothing all day will retire from there. It also fosters a culture of ""cover your a**"" where your coaches never have your back, and it pays to snitch on people."
bad,"Reliable,dependable,hard word working, with a keen attention to detail, and sense of urgency."
bad,"I have worked at Lowes for several years now and I have seen mediocre workers go from temporary positions to full-time within months, while people that are hard working and conscientious about their jobs cannot advance. The managers give little hours to the part-timers (sometimes as little as 10 hours a week) and make them feel forced to quit. Then the part-timers get to a point where they realize that the full-time that they have been striving and working very hard for is just not going to happen. I understand that sometimes things happen, people receive good things when they are undeserved, some people that deserve good things get forgotten. When 1 out of 8 people that are given the ability to advance in a company actually deserve it... that resonates in the store and everyone in the company feels it."
bad,"insufficient scheduling, poor management , most co-workers were lazy and seemed to get away with it."
bad,"stocking shelves running cash register mixing paint etc. Management was not friendly at all. I quit from here because my daughter was left with my baby-sitter and burned her hand on a sparkler on the fourth of july. I was informed by my sitter that she and my mother had called and spoke to management three different times and I WAS NOT TOLD. I went to the manager paul and he asked me what was more important...my job or taking my kid to the hospital because he had a business to run and they had not scheduled anyone to my department. I then unpacked my locker and left. most enjoyable part of my job was coming in and being with my co-workers. hardest part of the job, not being able to tuck my kids in a night cause I got come so late in the evening."
bad,"Typical day is to complete two days worth of work in eight hours.  An eight hour shift doesn't exist but yet company refuse to have overtime.  Great Co-Workers to work with was the only reason I lasted that long.  The pay wasn't good enough for work that I was required to do.  But as far as job security, as long as you worked you had job."
bad,I would like to not discuss at all.  they defintely are a work in progress
bad,"At Lowes, I was the Team Lead in the tool department.  Product knowledge and building customer relations were paramount to my being successful in generating sales and increasing profits.  A typical day would consist of me being asked recommendations regarding tools and then suggesting the best product for the customer; this I did for about half of my shift.  The other half was spent trying to identify potential shoplifters and to stop these people from stealing.  While I did find aspects enjoyable, it soon became apparent that there was little room for upward mobility.  Management did little to encourage employees to work harder, and often treated employees disrepesctfully.  Most of the co-workers I dealt with on a daily basis regarded their position with contempt (as did many managers).  The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was meant to do more with my life (I received no offers of promotions upon completing college), and no matter how hard I worked, salary increases were in no way tied to job performance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day, when I could go home.  The only truly positive thing I can say about this company was that they worked around my college schedule, and I was able to maintian working 40 hours a week while going to college."
bad,"Fast space work, only fifteen minute break, but by the time you get to break area its' time to get back to work the place is a large warehouse with bathrooms too far."
bad,"A typical work day includes: preparing the store for customers prior to opening, focusing on customer service and sales, and working on down-stocking lists and cleaning departments prior to closing.  I learned more ways to implement effective problem-solving skills, how to improve on my ability to work as a team, and the importance of communication. Management is unorganized and lacks effective communication. For example, one manager takes an associate out of a department to help in another, but does not notify department manager so that the associate's responsibilities to his/her own department can be covered. My coworkers are great. Each person does their part to get things done in a timely manner and they are all team players who are willing to help the other associates. The hardest part of the job is working under conditions when the store is under staffed on its busiest days. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting nice customers and forming a family-like bond with co-workers."
bad,"Lowe's Customer Service Desk is a very productive, fun working area."
bad,"The work is overwhelming, little help from management team. Store Manager is great, but ASM's have no clue how to run a store and unfortunate the HR Manager is oblivious when it comes to know what is happening on the sales floor. Very low morale, associates overworked, absolutely no teamwork! You don't learn anything from management, no engagement from them. You are on your own, you either sink or swim. Most of the associates do not work or show up to work, the one's that do, are overworked, to make up for the ones that don't show up. There is no discipline at all, so everyone does whatever they want, no repercussions whatsoever.... The crazies running the asylum!!!!!"
bad,This company Pays for experience. Expect lower compensation rates for the first time job goers while more experienced workers can get paid for that experience. Great schedules easy to work around your personal life because of the size of the crew your working with. Decent opportunities to move up. However difficult to reach upper management. Which speaking of which is a giant cluster of disarray. Every department has a manager. Depending on your store you'll either have 4 floor mangers and 2 assistant mangers or 6 assistant mangers all above you and working independently of you. Not to mention the head cashiers who are still technically managers. Which there are normally 3 on duty. Plus the store manager. All of whom depending on seniority can pull you off any task at anytime to do what they believe is more important which will get you in trouble with your previous manager or them. And if you attempt to explain your already performing a task more often then not they will still expect you to perform both tasks at the same time. And you have no time to seek out the previous manager to inform them you are being pulled onto another task. This translates to a massive lack of communication between managers which often gets you stuck in the middle.
bad,Lowes is very rapidly changing from a company who used to care about its people to a company about its bottom line and how to pocket more money nin its execs pockets. very frustrating work enviroment
bad,I worked with some very good people in a team. That is what made work enjoyable to me but other aspects of the job were not so good. Management telling you one thing and them changing their minds later. Other workers getting ahead but don't do the work.
bad,"The people are great to work with. The customers that you speak with daily are Lowes Hardware employees, they are great people to talk to and are very grateful for your help with their systems."
bad,"For the most part my co-workers were good to work with. I was required to do many things, keep the carts in the parking lot organized, organize shelves, help customers heavy purchases, sometimes i had to stand by the door and greet customers, and I had to report to calls over the PA system. I was also asked to clean bathrooms because they got rid of the janitors. Closing is the most difficult part of this job because you are required to bring all the carts inside which can take hours."
bad,"It was nice in the summer because you got a decent amount of hours, but any other time its pretty awful, I'm getting 10 hours a week so I have no income really."
bad,.Hours sucked
bad,Istarted out watering plants in the garden center. Then I became an F.S.A. which is a weekend maintence person. While working f.s.a. I also worked in the electrical department and tools and hardware.
bad,"Lowe's is a great place to work part-time if you want to go to school, however once in full-time positions your availability must be open 24/7."
bad,"There is a very structured business model forwarded down from the corporate office. If you are willing to relocate, there is a higher possibility for promotions. Employees are expected to work weekends and holidays. Pay scale varies greatly on the wages that are negotiated and the sales volume of the store location."
bad,Always understaffed. Never know when you will get a break and it could change at any given moment. There is different rules for each day depending on who is working. Department manager is worthless. No one cares about their job there. We dont have any applicants that even want to work here. Guess they heard about our great management team. (not)
bad,The management team were not employee friendly of not greeting them during business hours.
bad,"I used the open door policy . I caught 2 people in unappropriate behavior and reported them, I then had retaliation against me. I got called into the office numerouse times for small things, while the two people got raises and better postitions in the company. Managmenet said if it didn't happen on camera, they couldn't do anything about it."
bad,"They don't have a dependable schedule, which has made it very hard for my family.  I have to always go and get my schedule fixed.  They have also ignored my religious accommodation."
bad,"Pretty decent pay but they start everyone off at different wages for some reason, some people start off making more or less than you for the same position. Somewhat flexible hours depending on what you apply for. Highly unorganized job, managers pay little attention to your needs and blame you for it, they change your schedule a lot without informing you. They once went 3 months straight without giving me an actual schedule so technically I didn't have one. They recently changed my schedule without telling me and cut hours for part timers and have two weeks off. Majority of the managers have favoritism for certain employees. They also will have you ""help"" the rest of the departments in the store even though it is not your job. Wouldn't really recommend working here unless you're comfortable with this work condition."
bad,"Like the place and the people but the have started cutting hours a lot when the employees really cannot afford to have hours cut, I wouldn't mind staying here if they didn't cut hours so much and allowed for more substantial raises along with the additions they have made to the responsibilities of their associates."
bad,Customer service in tools. I keep the place clean and safe to work in. I do what I'm told to do. And get the job done. I welcome customers back to visit us again.
bad,"The company itself has good intentions, however the current store I work at the managers are excellent. Most of them. They have such a high turnover because they don't make expectations clear if their employees, it's ridiculously annoying and tedious sometimes to come in and have 5 things on your desk and they give no context on how to solve the issue"
bad,"Assistant managers were very friendly and helpful. Much more of a laid back environment than Home Depot. However, I was not paid what I was worth or given the hours I deserved and that is what prompted me to leave for a better job"
bad,Takeing care of my customers on a daily basis. Maintaining clean safe work area.           Management team needs to step there game up. Corporate takes for ever to acomplish a goal.
bad,"Management is a joke, they rarely ever believe they're employees. They talk about you as soon as you turn your back, it was like working with a bunch of high school drama kings & queens sad to say. Best thing I ever did was quit & move on to something else."
bad,"work was stressful with the job changing from day to day never enough help all ways doing other departments work, went through different managers all the time."
bad,"Quick training by employees who don‚Äôt even know their job. Threats of write ups or termination of you don‚Äôt meet quotas for LPP/EPP, credit cards. People who work in department who know nothing about it. Very frustrating."
bad,I was hired as an individual for the Northridge store to be the house interior designer. I designed kitchens and baths and sold them through Lowe‚Äôs. The program has since been desolvef  so I was laid off with the rest of my colleges across the in February. Received Severance and unemployment for the five years I was there.
bad,Not a great place to work very dirty and you will be stuck doing other peoples jobs because it isn't managed great. A plus is good vacation time for full time employees.
bad,Great place to work if you just want to have a part-time job but not as a career. Upper level store management is inconsistent and often disruptive to sales environment. Corporate level management has no relationship with worker bee employees and therefore constantly make policy changes  that wreak havoc at the store level.
bad,"Great place to start out, that's it. They don't work with your schedule and will attempt to try and force you to work hours they want. Managers are a hit and miss with some great, others not."
bad,"I loved my time working at Lowe's until the very end when there was not enough workers, not people who cared, and it became too stressful for people like me and my coworkers who have been there for years who knew how it was five six years ago when we were all one big happy family and worked  together . Hours are all over the place and you see weekends very rarely"
bad,"The longer I worked here, the longer I was being expected to do my job and everyone else‚Äôs. Awful management besides Andy and Joseph. A store where you would enjoy doing your job, until your work is no longer credited and more is always asked with no hesitation."
bad,"Lowe's provides a good wage for the retail sector and access to good benefits including health insurance and retirement plans. The work can be physically demanding, but not especially difficult."
bad,"I used to love working for Lowes. We had a flexible scheduled and worked different shifts.  Now we are on a set shift (for example: 6-3, 10-7, or the closing shift). There is no leeway.  Days off are no longer consistent. Too many changes occurring in a short amount of time which makes the job stressful and not a good place to work any longer."
bad,You never knew who was gonna be your manager because they switch them. If your not friends with management then you better find a different job because they will let you go.... They also make you clean the bathrooms even tho your a cashier. They hire for managers even tho those people dont know how to manage
bad,Big corporation with horrible management the managers don't do anything and hard work is not appreciated at all.  They don't care about anything but what corporate tells them. I promise your work ethic means Nothing:(
bad,Although lowes pays employees fairly not knowing if you had a job day to day is very stressful. The scheduling was a nightmare never knowing what days you would be off and never have 2 days in a row off. Also only 1 weekend every 2 months made spending time with family impossible.
bad,"I was hired under two managers where one ended up at a different store and the other found a new position else where. Once they left, things got out of hand. No organization, nobody really cared about how the store looked, bad attitudes ran amuck and that made it all hard to deal with extremely difficult customers (affluent area, so very needy people). I enjoyed my time under my original managers but after that, it was only a matter of time before I left. Pay was decent but was asked to go well beyond the requirements of my job because they couldn't fill another position and wasn't compensated for it, even though I didn't want those duties of the other position. But at the end of the day, you are just a body."
bad,"The management has no idea what they are doing and are poor at communicating with their employees. I loved helping customers and enjoyed my daily tasks, however, the management ruined the work environment. Management would talk about you behind your back, completely unprofessional and when you needed help they were nowhere to be found. I would complete my daily tasks but still do others associates jobs and get in trouble if it wasn't complete when the manager wanted it done but they never discussed the problem with the original associate. There was no recognition for a job well done."
bad,"Store manager was a weak leader who would rather triple load jobs on people than make the assigned people do their job. "
bad,"The sudden axing of the assemblers, FSA and pickup desk associates made it crystal clear that you're just a number to the company, nothing more. It's created uneasiness in the store as everyone is wondering if they're next. Here is a perfect example of why Lowe's is anti union."
bad,"Favoring people over others.  Management rarely did anything.   Not an ideal place for a career unless you get in close with management or those they favor.  This is only at the Tahlequah, OK location."
bad,"In general, what Lowe's offers and what they pay you for your time isn't bad at all, in fact if you're there long enough I'm sure you can take care of yourself in the long run. The problem was the management at the location at which I worked. When I first started, everything was fine, but towards the latter 6 months of my employment management was all over the place, nobody had any accountability for actions, they were highly understaffed, and departments seemed to be failing as a whole, which is what I made my decision to leave off of. So yes, all in all the company is great when it comes to benefits and such, just in my experience (and former coworkers) management needed major work."
bad,If there were trained and personable managers it would be a much better place to work! Untrained and unprofessional leadership leads to an unmotivated unengaged group or employees.
bad,"Poor management, they offer heath insurance(too expensive) for tha salary that they pay. 401-k and stock purchase."
bad,This place does have the opportunity to be a good job. You have to want to work. They give you plenty of time off throughout the year to use for yourself. This is the reason why a lot of people get fired and I really don‚Äôt see how they point out. My issues were management and how difficult it is to move up. I thought the responsibilities and expectations were unrealistic for Lowes as a whole.
bad,Worked/working here for 7 years and it‚Äôs sad to say that it has gotten worse. Typical retail job atmosphere. High turnover and bad management. Over working and under appreciated
bad,"New corporate changes. Jobs unstable. Currently low morale. Pay is good. Benefits are good, however workload in unachievable. Recent layoffs in multiple positions."
bad,"For a retail job they pay fairly well and the full time health benefits are very good. Aside from that, I would not recommend working here. Management demonstrates poor leadership skills and overwork the same 3-4 associates to cover multiple departments at once to ensure tasks are complete. The associates who do work become burnt out and morale has dropped considerably because of it. There are constant corporate restructures that result in some employees losing their jobs or forced to take a pay cut. It presents a feeling of poor job security and unwillingness to advance within the company because you feel as if your job could be cut at any minute"
bad,"I actually enjoyed working there until my position was eliminated. Then I took another role making $2 less an hour. I saw many others scared for their job. After I left another 3000 jobs were eliminated, despite the profitability of the company. Would not recomend working there until they stabilize."
bad,"My time working for lowe's, in the beginning work was good and also fun. Over the years, as much things change, the overall moral was lower and lower."
bad,"Lowe's in general is a great company to work for and provides good benefits however, the specific location I worked had management issues and you cant have a good work environment with poor management. A typical day is working the cash registers and helping customers in any way possible."
bad,"Ever since the CEO change, things are going down hill. Looks like we all need to jump ship. I am looking for a job now on Indeed. Most people are leaving before they get fired. They keep eliminating jobs."
bad,They treat you like a rented mule pay is low a good job for retired people who are bored or students needing extra cash.they promote team work but do not  follow through with it.
bad,"This store started out great. But change in management, no one is held accountable for their mistakes or poor work ethic. New CEO has cut a lot of positions and bringing in 3rd party services to take their place. Getting rid of full time and replacing with part time."
bad,"I work the overnights 21:30pm to 05:30AM and we easily have one of the more stressful jobs due to the fact we have to deal with unloading 2 trucks worth of freight which is usually 2000 or more pieces and having usually about 5 people to work the entire store overnights to pack it all out or topstock it. This wouldn't be much of an issue if the day crew actually paid attention to what is in the topstock and packed that out instead of ordering 5 more of the same water heater that we have 15 of in topstock so now we have to many items and no space to store them, and on top of that day time management decides to dump extra work on us such as resetting sections when the store actually has an MSI team to do this, so now not only do we have to do our jobs, but we have to do the jobs of other people in a very limited amount of time due to the fact the store itself opens at 06:00am"
bad,"Absolutely tragic place. Operating with way to little people. So disorganized."
bad,"I worked here for a summer and not only were the customers the rudest people I had ever met. But when they are rude they‚Äôll give you a bad survey which may make u lose your job even if you did nothing. The managers were so weak minded and the process for letting me go was unprofessional, they let me go in the middle of a shift saying that they didn‚Äôt have enough hours; but also said I was one of the best people they hired that summer."
bad,Would not recommend  working here  hours are everywhere days off are random expect to much from you and don‚Äôt hold people accountable for things that they don‚Äôt do
bad,Perpetually Understaffed. After June hours get cut drastically. Full timers are often left alone to cover multiple departments. People are always calling off.
bad,"I worked as a Sales Associate in the Home Decor department. I interacted with customers, handled phone calls, made custom orders, and cut blinds in store. Daily stocking, cleaning, inventory, general upkeep. The biggest problem with this job was the lack of staff. There were only three of us in my entire department to run our area all day everyday and even then we couldn't always accommodate one another. Half the time the employees would show up early or late and decide their own schedule hours. The scheduling was all over the place and unorganized, I didn't know who was making my schedules half the time and who was my overseer for that day. I also was not properly trained, I got thrown into the sales floor and had to wing it 90% of the time when I started, they scheduled me to run the department by myself for 3 days in a row my first week as an official employee and I had no clue what I was doing. Now, I'm someone who can naturally pick up anything very fast and I somehow managed, but it was extremely frustrating. As a Home Decor associate I was also required to take over and cover the Paint Department as needed since our departments are supposed to help one another. I cannot tell you how many times I was running both departments by myself, I am a very capable person, but that is not how it is supposed to be run. To give you an idea; I was carrying two phones for each department, if you opened you had to clean and prepare each paint machine or the blind machine, and put away whatever the overnight crew decided to leave in your area. I had to do daily inventory, cleaning, restock"
bad,Management is a joke. The higher ups don't care about their employees one bit. It's all about getting their bonuses. It makes the incentive to do well at Lowe's go down immensely. Everybody who works there is apathetic and just doesn't care because there's no reason to care. Management gives us no reason to care. It's stressful and not worth the amount of stress that that it causes.
bad,As a delivery driver wasn't bad until policy changed which made us work longer hours and made our job harder. We were forced to deliver to at least 9 stops a day but normally it was 11 or 12 . And the driving radius was ridiculously huge we had to drive to towns that already had a Lowes bc they might not have had one thing instock. We were not allowed to accept tips. And we had to stay out until the truck was empty even after the store had closed.
bad,"When I first started there I thought it was great.  The employees are good, however management and HR are not in sync.  It seems as though they take car of each other.  The company seems to be restructuring so much.  The attitude of employees seems down,  Morale is very low."
bad,"The store's general manager treated cashiers and mid-level managers like we were just numbers; among less authoritative positions, we were much more social and mutually supportive."
bad,Would not recommend some locations may offer better career advancement. Other's are mediocre an that's unacceptable. This experience needed help more than ever.
bad,"I work in the lumber department.  To do anything there, you need two people either to operate a machine or to lift heavy boards. Because of this, Lumber has more people than other departments.  To get their work done they borrow people from lumber meaning that I don't have enough to get my work done.   Upper management is complaining that work isn't getting done, however they won't fix the staffing issue making most days stressful.  During the summer, we end up rushing just to keep up.  The lower management and fellow co-workers are friendly however, and are the main thing keeping me there."
bad,"Lowe's does not stack up against home depot when it comes to being a good place to work."
bad,Large amount of favoritism in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is communicating with superiors and effectively relaying information vital to completing any task assigned.
bad,The job is terrible. Unless you enjoy hearing people complain some over trivial things and some over understandable issues with installs then this is not a great job. It‚Äôs a necessary job but horrible
bad,I have been employed here for 2 years. The management is getting worse day by day. You are over worked due to lack of help and they don't seem to listen nor make an effort to hire more people. The pay is decent and I like the benefits.  I would not recommend this place if you want to advance your career. Managers are over worked and seem to get very frustrated to the point where they don't care.
bad,"Dont work here unless you have an extreme amount of patience, able to be called in 24/7, and can deal with a conceited boss. There are little to no benefits if your part time. You have to have completely open availability if you wanna be fulltime. If you cant work a single hour out of a day you are automatically part time."
bad,"The work load is very uneven where the people in the sales floor often are on break, aren't there or somewhere else. if something need done physically it was often left to the receiving and lumber departments. cashiers often were seen standing around with nothing to do and no additional tasks asked of them."
bad,"Worked at two different stores. The first store was fine liked my coworkers, they worked as hard as i did; no slacking. The second store i worked at was hard, tons of call offs (i worked Customer Service) a lot of talking when there were lines and phone was ringing and the talking was with the head cashiers which meant i couldn't say anything or at least that's how i felt. Then there would come our manager screaming cause the phone is ringing and there is a line all while i was trying to do it all most of the time. A little while after i had a head injury and felt i could not work properly since i was forgetting things the second a customer told me them, my manager did not bother to ask how i was doing even though the injury happened at work! i got tired of it all."
bad,"This job was not what I expected. Worked in outside lawn and garden as a waterer. Working outside is not for the faint of heart, lifting and loading heavy bags of gravel and mulch is incredibly difficult if not accustomed to lifting. Store manager was very demanding and difficult. Outside plant specialist manager was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, the store manager for this location was never happy with how things were done outside which led to employees constantly having to rearrange the plants and displays.  This was very frustrating. Very stressful, wouldn't work here again."
bad,The fact the statics change each month and you are required to meet them can be frustrating because if you don't meet the static you will get discipline which could result in job termination. Depending on your department you may get cut more slack then other departments.
bad,"Honestly, in the machine that is Lowe's, you are a cog that is replaceable. Training and support from management is laughable, and overall store coverage is severely lacking. You will be hired to do the job you applied for, but don't be surprised if you're asked to handle everyone else's job regardless if you are trained properly or not. Also be careful about stepping in for your coworkers, because if you make a mistake you will be held accountable for that mistake you made trying to help out."
bad,"They changed management structure in stores, the CEO leaves, a new CEO comes in, then changes the structure again. Cutting part time employee hours to unlivable wages."
bad,"Working at lowe's isn't all bad, but it is not what i expected in a work place. The environment is a little too stressful in my opinion. The hours are very in consistent, the pay is fair, though. I am not getting the desired hours that i wish, and it is just a huge corporation that i am not comfortable with."
bad,"Of course I'm not going to post my actual store or position in the store but I will tell you that with the right management and the right attitude you can do great things with this company.  Lowes gives you an opportunity to learn what its all about. You would be surprised to know how many rude individuals are out there but if you are into problem solving and up for a challenge, Lowes is the place for you"
bad,"Lowes is a great starter job for somebody! Overall, it gave great experience! It helps an individual be more comfortable being able to talk to complete strangers."
bad,"Currently working as a night stock employee. If you're able I'd advise you to look for a different position or employment. The night supervisor barely does anything the whole night, besides sitting in the back office on her phone or fooling around with the other employees. Occasionally she comes out and helps however, majority of the time she doesn't. Every now and then if you're lucky you get yelled at by her for no reason or called a lier. In addition to this I get overwhelmed and overworked due to having to do my job as well as my co-workers and day shifts work as they don't do their job yet are never reprimanded for it Furthermore, Lowe's doesn't offer a night differential to night stock employees. I'm in the process of looking for new employment."
bad,"helping people fing plumbing items for the project they were working on, special order products for bathroom remodels. How to plumb a house and tell others how to do it as well."
bad,"Lowes takes overall good care of their employees, when you work holidays you get special meals made for the employees. What was said to me by the HR manager was ""work weekends or you'll be fired"" which I thought was quite cut throat. You had to learn for yourself no one really trained you on what to do or how to do so. Working conditions were tough in the hot sun outside. They gave you good breaks but the management pushed you hard."
bad,"Lowes have a lot  unorganized managers who has their favorite associates. Managers aren't consistent they all tell you something different, they don't care about the employees."
bad,So to me Lowe‚Äôs makes me feel like I‚Äôm treated like a dog. Since I‚Äôm a pro loader all I do pretty much is have me outside. They tell me I can‚Äôt go inside to help anyone.
bad,Lowe's is a good employer if you're young and not worried about providing for a family. its been years since I worked there so I'm not exactly sure how management is.
bad,"And I mean it. This place is a disaster."
bad,Too much work for the little bit of pay. The managers were ignorant and never had any perfessional experience. They used me well pass the 90 period leading me on to think I was getting the number 3 spot in the department and right before the birth of my first child they let me go
bad,"Suck ups get best treatment and prefered jobs  before the jobs are posted. Everyone has to apply and be interviewed for internal openings, if you are a selected few anyways."
bad,Constantly changing staff and roles.  Rules change as they go and dependent upon who you are.  Forced out of preferred roles to fill a gap elsewhere in a less desirable role.
bad,Poor structure. Unfair advantage if you are friends with management. Mismanagement occurring and poor store morale. You have to do more jobs than what you are paid for.
bad,I worked two years at this place and was constantly screwed over with the lack of authority given to others in the place. Not the hardest job in the world but it doesn‚Äôt seem they care too much about showing up or not. It‚Äôs as if the people who actually care and do show up get punished for those who don‚Äôt. Huge favoritism as well.
bad,"Lowe's has been an interesting experience so far. Having had my job cut in a restructuring that did more to harm the store culture than to help it, it was at least nice to not have been immediately laid off. However, my current position is easily as much work and responsibility as my job as a department manager for about 15% less pay. There is no longer enough management to maintain all the store processes, nor is there enough accountability to the employees for their overall behavior and productivity. I have been lucky enough to work under one of the best managers, but even he has more on his plate than one person can handle. At the end of the day, the philosophy of the company seems good, but the implementation is ineffective, the corporate management seemingly run by ignorance and whim, and the overall benefit to the employee who cares minimal. Unless you are a manager and moving up, Lowe's offers you nothing but stress."
bad,Too many managers for how many employees there are with many mixed messages. Very high workload as many areas of the store are critically understaffed because of the very high turnover rate. The hardest part about working there by far was the fact that management estimated inventory so nearly every count in the store was wrong.
bad,"Over all Lowe's is a good place to work.  The big down side is it reminds me of high school.  You have to be in a so called click to really advance, or fill like they are out to get you."
bad,"I get to work 20 min early and make coffee for the contractors so it is ready when the doors are opened. I make sure the lumber registers have bags, register tape, and are clean and ready for customers. I greet the contractors as they come in and ring up their items as they get ready to exit while making small talk and making sure their merchandise is bagged and in their hand or cart when they leave. I take payments for their accounts and check inventory for them."
bad,Poor management and many schedule changes.  Very disorganized and untidy store areas.  Other locations are more up to standard.  Job was close to home
bad,"Ran very unorganized and not up to date technology.  Too much volume for one location,  has potential if they could hold onto employees and mgt. Needs to update technology"
bad,It was a great company to work for about two years ago. If you go into any Lowe‚Äôs nowadays no one is motivated and hates being there. The reason is because of the manager switch they did. They lost a lot of really good managers and employees after that. A lot of regional and store managers went with friends other than great managers and you can see it in the stores. It‚Äôs sad.
bad,"normal lot attendant dutys, help with loadouts, tidy up the store, collect carts, and make sure that the cart bays were well supplied. management felt the need  to ""prove"" their power by writing up associates for unsubstantiated reasons, when challenged, they backed down, and receded the write ups."
bad,"While it's hopefully not corporate wide, the location I worked for is not worth going to unless its the closest hardware store to you. Very poor management and not enough staff to run a big warehouse store."
bad,"people are nice but lack of incouragement  to be better employees this could be the best place to work if they treat there employees with respect ,managers are not avaibale  at all times .i learned that no matter how much or how hard you work if you make a mistake they will take action against you.the best part was serving my coustomers.."
bad,"Worst Management ever seen. they will not promote you once hired and will tell you that there is always people getting promoted once hire which is a lie. outside people will always get the job over you so if hire, make sure its the position you'll want to keep for the next 10 years. then they'll ask to pomote you. they do work with trying to improve what you need to become manager or the next position ahead of yours but its just a way to keep you there in the position."
bad,"It's retail. You get what you sign up for. "
bad,"Not recommended unless you want long hours and low pay."
bad,Lowes needs to improve on work moral. They need to make sure all employees are working. Stop making the ones working do more work and make the ones walking around avoid working work.  Stop letting the employees from being on there cell phones on working hours. breaks are fine but being on the registers and on the floor while customers are in the store.
bad,Lowes is a good place when starting your working career.  They push you for numbers and management does not listen to suggestions.  Lot if very unhappy employees at my store.  Many are quitting
bad,I have nothing more to add. I‚Äôm only writing this in here because it‚Äôs requirec to continue past this point.  Everyone‚Äôs experience is different and it would depend on your job.
bad,"very busy store, face paced, compensation could be better, good management and HR, no Christmas parties, or employee incentives besides your pay check, very little employee recognition"
bad,This job is fairly good entry level warehouse work. The compensation is fair and here is plenty of overtime opportunity. Management is sometimes unorganized and somewhat biased towards their favorite employees.
bad,Start the day off early. Able to finish by mid-afternoon. As a delivery rider the scenery changes every day. Hardest part of the day is going into a filthy house.
bad,"Swing shift, low pay, low hours, high stress for the job. Unloading a truck and organizing it, small time frame, mentally stressful. Nothing else to say."
bad,niblock did away with department managers and created mini assistant store managers but with the same duties and more on top of them. the structure is not working
bad,"Management at the location I worked was terrible. I am not saying that for no reason... They were known for being terrible, so just be aware. I was constantly leaning things on the floor for my department and others. Not very ""cultural."""
bad,"overall horrible, experience.  They don't give college students hours. i lost my job due to a manger messing up my schedule, and they didnt call me to let me know i was atleast fired. I lost everything."
bad,"This place used to be halfway decent when I first started. It got me through college and that sufficed back then. Ever since the restructure nearly a year ago, the store hasn't been the same. We are still feeling the effects and they are only causing more problems than they are solving. The service managers have far too much on their plate and are constantly getting stressed out by being pulled in five different directions at once. "
bad,"I loved the ladies I worked with I consider them all friends that I get to keep even though my career at Lowes has ended."
bad,no communication or responsibility taken for anything. Customers never come fist for them only getting through their day. Work that they should be doing passed down to associates that do not have the training to complete.
bad,"Lowes was a very face paced workplace,It required you to be alert and pay attention to customers to ensure their shopping needs. I handled a large sums of money on any given business day"
bad,"The work is stressful and you are required to do a lot during a task. Also, management is hard on employees here. Although the pay and benefits make it worth it."
bad,"I enjoyed the work I did, It kept me busy and sent me home tired which to me meant that I actually did something all day(I don't like being bored). The biggest issue I had however was the management. They care more about how they look to the bosses and customers than the condition and morale of the employees. And convenience was more important that safety. I just want to state that I am not bad-mouthing this company, just being honest about my experience there. People have different experiences for different jobs"
bad,"This is an okay kind of job If you are a very happy and not easily upset kind of person. You hear customer complaints almost every and all day so if you are the kind of person that cannot handle that don't apply here. Also, there is a lot of down time and its very easy to dose off and forget what you are doing because you are sitting at a desk with very minimal stimulation. Will meet greet people and possibly make lifelong friends. Will probably gain a few extra pounds."
bad,"They prefer seasonal part time employees, the pay is low, and they like to downsize when things get tough.Hours and schedules fluctuate decent benefits."
bad,a very stressful unorganized to work in no communication skillls not a very good places to build and feel like you moving up in the company a company thats not willing to work with you on anything
bad,Lowe's is a good environment to work around but the management do a lot of picking and choosing of favorites for jobs. That is the only problem I had with them
bad,Lowe's use to be great but now it has gotten rather bad to work for. They want work with your school schedule because they don't want you to improve and move up or better yourself. The Management is a joke and HR is about as dumb as can be. I feel like Lowe's use to be great but with all the job cuts and displacement in the company  its not a great company to work for anymore. However if your just looking for a job to make some quick money like as a college kid Party money go for it. Don't make it a career.
bad,"Loading lumber in the lumber department.  The pay is not good. If there are no opening at the end of the season, they let you go.  Not good if you are looking for stable employment."
bad,"open or close store. stock freight or downstock, assist customers on helping them find things to improve there home or project. answer phones manage other employees. place used to be fun. they re-organized management positions form 15 down to 5 we had to re-apply for open positions as they came open. if we didnt take a cut in pay and fit in we were out of a job in feb. 2018. i enjoy working with people i have been at the same job 21+ years"
bad,Im pretty sure it varies from store to store but mine sucks management is wack they do not really trust people to do there jobs and dint fix any problems that are happening internally
bad,"I love working for Lowe's they are a good Company to work for they are my second family and my second home , if you're looking for a part time job Lowe's is the place to work"
bad,"I started with loving this company but after corporate rolled out a new hierarchy it went to straight to chaos. Everyone is over stressed with a mile long list of tasks to complete daily. The day never ends well here anymore, your always in trouble for something or struggling somewhere."
bad,"With the company policies and manager roles the company has gone downhill. "
bad,"I worked as a cashier. Throughout my employment I helped delivery, receiving, loading, appliances, plumbing, lumber and janitorial roles. I found that I was responsible for multiple departments despite being a cashier."
bad,"The benefits and overtime are the only positive things this company offers. Career advancement is a possibility if you know the right people. The attitude and culture during the night shift is rough to say the least. It's definitely a stressful job due the the fact that people tend to quit quickly. The work load is not divided evenly and resources aren't designated properly. The night managment is unprofessional and does not communicate effectively with its employees. "
bad,"Coming into work things are never organized, employees don't get alone but somewhat keep things cordial . it was just a very unusual environment to work in on a daily basis"
bad,Used to be a good place to work until Niblock took over.  The are pushing the seasoned people out who were committed to the company and replacing them with part time people that are only there for a check.
bad,"lots of turnover, minimal wage increases( insultingly low) no matter how willing you are to assist in other departments when management has not scheduled enough associates to attend to the customers needs you will not be rewarded when it comes time for that meager annual pay raise."
bad,I worked Monday through Friday 6 to 3. My typical day was spent get a list of projects from corporate office and changing product setups and display products throughout the store.
bad,"Things started well. The position soon became uninspiring. the managers were hired to help the employee's, but things became all about the numbers. That is not what it said in the info meeting."
bad,Good pay and benefits but lack of job security.  It seems they have little thought about their employees as most employees are constantly stressed.  Managers are decent though.
bad,"I did really enjoy going in to work at Lowes, than in January they made a massive management change. They lost over 30 employees in the following months over the changes they had made. I tried to stay as long as I could but, there was no back up or help around."
bad,"Extremely hectic, not  much help, responsible for things I couldn't control. Management was not familiar with the new program i was in. Made it very difficult to execute with success. Corporation stress the importance of fairness and ethics, but when I did my job in that manner I met with ultimate push back and eventually let go. I love working with such a diverse group of clients. they really stepped up when I left."
bad,For the work and needed to be done did not have enough people who are motivated to get anything done or made other do their job while not getting paid as well as they did
bad,"There is no training other the on the job, meaning you need to learn quickly and without much interaction with other associates. There doesn't seem to be a lot of long term associates working for the company the max would be 4-5 years "
bad,"It is obvious that Lowe's doesn't practice people skills. Although the company as a whole puts up a good facade that they care about their employees, it is only a show."
bad,"Poor Management, yell at you for not getting department looking great, when short staff.  Then taking all the credit for great looking department by higher ups."
bad,"Guiding customer's to make informed decisions on home improvement. Easy to obtain knowledge in wide array of different projects. Management gives simple clear job expectations.  Due to company downsizing, larger workloads being placed on smaller pool of employees. Employs both knowledgeable and open-minded employees. Most difficult thing about the company is the downsizing currently in progress. Good company to learn retail, customer service and management roles."
bad,"fast paced, regular customers, understaffed most of the time. Lots of good folks work here, but sometimes the mgrs are condescending and have tendency to humiliate you in front of customers. Standing in one spot for hours on end, don't always get breaks due to understaffing. Also, don't always get to leave on time.  Quite often forgotten about when it's your break time or leaving time.  Tried for over a year to get into another position, with no luck."
bad,"A typical day at lowes, "
bad,"Being a Salaried Manager you have to expect a fast pace and high stress environment. I have a good team of peers and enjoy working with a lot of my staff. The downfall, as with most retail, is the corporate structure changing constantly, causing job stability to not exist. Our Market staff is as supportive as possible try to be there for the store staff as well. Also I get paid to get mentally beat down by customers and staff. If your skin is thick and you get lucky enough to have a good staff then it is not the worst place to work."
bad,Not a great company to work for but it's a job.  Communication is terrible.  Not enough people to man the store at any given time.  Expectations exceed what is possible with little or no assistance.
bad,"extremely poor management "
bad,"Lowe's as a company can be a great place to work for. Depending on the store, managers can be good or bad. I have worked in several different stores and seen all different types. Most days you will end up covering several departments at one time. Store moral is terrible, even more so since the company changed policy's and eliminated department managers. Causing regular employees to take on responsibilities they do not paid nearly enough for. All in effort to cut the pay of a good portion of employees that were making a fair wage to begin with."
bad,"Lowes WAS a good company to work for, but with the restructure and hours that you were scheduled, it really took a turn for the worse.  Long hours, extremely understaffed, no support by management and no work/life balance.  You worked at the whim of your ASM, who did not really care about you if you had a family, stating the needs of the business were more important.  Great for someone who is retired and can work part time, but not for someone who would like to make this a career."
bad,"Lowes used to be a great company to work for, the management was friendly, and your coworkers were awesome. However as of this year things have a taken a different change since they fired most of management and put a lot more responsibility with no extra pay on the new ""managers"". New safety rules and regulations have made it to the point that you can barely do your job without getting fired and if management doesn't like you, they will look for any reason to fire you."
bad,"I work in the warehouse and loaded and unloaded trucks.scan in merchadise,kept it clean.I learn more about a home improvement store.renovation to a home or business.the managers where knowlegeable."
bad,Lowes pays good but other then that the company wasn't that great to work for. Managers aren't that great either all just depends on the store you actually work in.
bad,"I worked for 7 years as a loader. I had to get carts and help customers load. It's a bit ridiculous, as although it was mainly me, they wanted a empty lot and to perfectly handle loadings everyday. It was a issue of staffing, but whenever I brought this to attention, it was pretty much shrugged off."
bad,"Never fully staffed"
bad,"a lot of corporate changes not for the positive of the associates. "
bad,"Management will allow customers to be as rude or obscene as they would like to employees. As long as you are not being physically assaulted you have no place disagreeing with a customer here. "
bad,Monotonous Corporate atmosphere with fluctuating hours and high turnaround. Almost no room for advancement within your location. Staff and Management were a pleasure to work with. Nothing they could do about it.
bad,"My overall day at work at lowes is getting there and meeting new people at work, you rarely get time to breathe it is busy and time goes by fast.  Management has not been the greatest, but we have a new manager and seems to be shaping it up.  I've learned lots of things, tools, hardware, just many departments, the most enjoyable part of my job is I like my job and do it well as well as talking and joking with people."
bad,"Enjoyed working with most or all the employees and some of the "
bad,"mostly micro management, expectations of each department vary by day and management. scheduling is based on ""needs"" of business, most customers and employees are friendly."
bad,"when hired I was told the position was temp to hire, it was no. once hours for benefits and vacation pay is almost reached, simos will end your assignment before you will receive any benefits. lowes dc is an awesome place to work, when  hired information given by simos is incorrect and tells you anything to fill position."
bad,Good first job fun and experienced co worker management could be better and mainince on equipment could be done to a better standard just an all around decent place to work
bad,"Wonderful co-workers, always willing to help you. Management sub-par. Open door is  lip service. I had beef with co-worker and took to management. Assistant manager  ""Best friends"" with co-worker. Took to store manager who  gave it back to same assistant manager who then told me that complaints that go out of the department affect the whole department...bascially dont do it anymore."
bad,I loved working at Lowes initially. They are one of the highest paying retailers. But the management uses you mercilessly and doesn't give you anything for it. I did two other jobs besides the one I was hired to do and I didn't get a bump in pay nor did they at least take me from part time to full time. They gave a promotion to someone who never came to work and when they did they left all the time. I guess it depends on which location you work at.
bad,"I have been working at Lowes for about. 6 months, excuse my expression Busting my Rear!Local management has been awesome, employees are something else! Ive been trying to get on fulltime but have been by passed cause of being discriminated cause I am Hispanic!"
bad,Checking customers out making sure they found everything they needed for the DIY projects. Enjoyed working in all departments.
bad,"Very Stressful "
bad,Everyday work was fine but I felt there was not as much opportunity for advancement as they advertise and applying for other jobs within the company seemed like the tables were stacked against you at times unless the right managers liked you.
bad,"You will never be bored working at Lowe's. Even in the most extreme rain, sleet, snow and heat the customers will still come. Especially in the plumbing departments."
bad,"As a Product Service Associate, you learn about multi-tasking between handling customer's needs and assigned work for you to complete.  You also catch a glimpse of Lowes corporate culture because the work you are assigned is delegated by corporate supervisors."
bad,"must be able to work multiple positons with very little help,overall a good place to work.enjoyed co workers and customer service."
bad,"Typical day at work was being customer focused helping cashiers and other co-workers, I learned many lower end mangement skills money handling and scheduling for the shift. open and closing procedures"
bad,"They over hire for several areas of the store, and then cut back hours and fire people to make up for the huge payroll deficit versus labor demand."
bad,was only there for a little bit but it was decent i learned what the different types of wood and such. got to learn how to drive a tow-motor and stuff
bad,"Managment doesn't seem to generally care about employee needs or availability. Will lie are part-time positions, all positions are full time up to 42 hours."
bad,"I have nothing good to say about my experience.  They were really deceptive. I don't recommend for long term."
bad,"no comment about company.  retail atmosphere.  If you work in retail you know what it is.  i do not have any further comments about this company."
bad,I worked here while in college.  After I left another job I went back to working here to pay the bills when I was searching for a new career.  It was good to help pay the bills but never saw it as a career.
bad,Lowe's is a great Co. to work for. I've learned more about retail and what it means to be a key team member in a positive sales force.
bad,"I was in charge of store financials and services. Enjoyed working with my team, grew as a leader."
bad,It really depends on which store you work at and how management is.
bad,I like the people but when speaking with management about further advancement they shut you out and bring in young college kids with no real world experience.
bad,"Daily I meet with my assocaites to go over our daily tasks and or projects. I review inventory reports, manage teams that mainly deal with logistics. The store where I currently work budgets 30 million dollars a year. These jobs are physical jobs and consists of being able to lift on average 50-75 lbs on your own. My co-workers consist of other department managers over other areas. The hardest part of my job is trying to complete tasks under staffed. I am not over the hiring so I am not able to fill areas in my department immediately due to the policies in place and the capabilites of a depatment manager in his/her role. I enjoy working along side all of the associates I am over, I enjoy challenging them to excell in their positions and empower them to make good decisions."
bad,"just like any old retail location, it is a good company to work for depending on your location you may have poor management and infrastructure. It is a fair place to work"
bad,"Enjoyed my co-workers, but the store management staff is inept and continuously micro-manages the employees, keeping them from striving to reach their own potential"
bad,"I enjoy this job and all of my coworkers. Sometimes it can be slow, but my managers always find something for me to do to fill my time."
bad,Working at Lowe's you learn a lot about the business aspect of things. What I love most is the daily interactions you have with customers. Knowing that you can help a person out and have them leave with a smile makes my day. You get to learn a lot about the people you work with and grow a lot of long term friendships.
bad,"When I started in 2008, their motto for any employee was ""Retire Rich.""  Starting in 2011, the company has eliminated commission to all but a couple employees, eliminated spiffs on special order items, reduced health care coverage, dwindled full-time opportunities, and watered-down the skill requirements of specialists.  They use to give stock away to employees...not anymore.  Needless to say, the ""retire rich"" banners have been taken down.  This company is part of America's race to the bottom and the erosion of the middle class. Bad for America in the long run."
bad,ok place to work wasn't there long i just liked i had the weekends off pay was awful
bad,Fun place with great benefits. The scheduling is not good for people who have families as it consist of a rotating schedule.
bad,"I had a few friends warn me that they had worked here and either transferred to another location or left the company completely! Like most places, there is a ton of gossip and a lack of support. I had a pretty bad fall a few months into a new position. The fall happened at home but they had just merged with a new third party company that handled their time off claims and such. It was very confusing and even the HR manager didnt know exactly what was going on! Yet somehow I was supposed to?! "
bad,Not a very enjoyable work place.  A lot of times you had to pull orders by yourself that should have required another person.  It was all about what management wanted and not about helping the consumer.  Pay was below what should have been for the job that I was doing.
bad,Never had enough people to help. Had good coworkers/friends for most part.
bad,I feel like the employees haven't been trained on everything they should have been trained on
bad,"There are a lot of Chiefs and not enough Indians. I heard it is better at other stores but at my store the management staff are told to be hard core non emotional unfriendly robots. They will not promote you if you are liked by your peers thinking you can not possibly be a good manager if you re friendly. Great pay, one of the best for retail. More than Home Depot. They will not work with any kind of schedule you may have being full time. You can't request hour or days off unless you take a vacation day. So if you are in school work there part-time."
bad,"Interesting, Senior Management will always say there is an ""Open door policy"", that ""they care"", if you want to advance they'll help.  I never once saw Senior Management provide any assistance or mentorship to any employees who expressed desire to grow in the company.  The only time they provide ""help"" is right before they get a visit from their boss.  Only then do they care everyone knows what is going on in their store."
bad,"My 'career' with Lowe's started off alright.  I was hired on as a Seasonal Cashier for the Garden Center, and was kept on after the high season petered out.  Things were going well, until I started trying to get positions off the register.  I was stonewalled, told I didn't have enough experience, discouraged from applying for open positions in the stores, refused interviews, and in the few interviews I actually had, I was flat out told I wasn't going to get it, no explanation, no offer for further coaching for interviews or training for any positions I might have wanted to apply for in the future.  In short, my future with Lowe's consists of cashiering, or nothing."
bad,"It is a great place to work for, but the new store manager that started working there not to long ago is not a people person. Does not like to engage in communication with customers, acts stuck up towards associates, only worried about sales instead of actual customer focus"
bad,"The Lowes organization is a good company with good values, good engineered standards, and decent compensation and benefits.  The individual distribution locations do not live up to the values and standards, however.  From managers sleeping in the office all night, to HR managers making fun of disabled and mentally handicapped people they employee, it is unfortunate that the leadership gives the organization a bad name."
bad,"A good first job, but the only downer there was upon hiring they promise you can move up quickly. Not true."
bad,"if you dont mind being passed over for advancement because you know more then the store manager, or the fact that you have had more experience then half the people they hired....not to mention just being a body on the floor to assist customers then this would be the job for you."
bad,"Alot of heavy lifting , bending, turning."
bad,"Overall Lowes is a good place to work, but in the last year the store manager has been excessively writing up employees. This has lead to poor morale within the store, while we have made the budget for the year getting bonuses every quarter. In communications with associates from other stores the problem seems to be driven by our store manager."
bad,"the women only cared about the men that walked in the door, same as the men. the management was terrible. We would have one person to watch over 4 departments at one time. The pay was decent. But overall it sucked"
bad,"Started at 9 am. Stocked freight until about 10:30 or when done. Put away appliances in the receiving area. Assist where needed on sales floor and receive trucks as they came in. Learned customer relations, making keys, threading pipe, cutting glass. Operations of various power equipment including fork lift, order picker, and reach truck. Hazmat requirements. The management was always changing. Always made an effort to get to know them. If co-worker was promoted I congratulated them. Did not find anything difficult. Working with the public was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Typical day at work is dealing with customers and managers, depending on what side of the coin toss you are on. You must be a people person. It's a friendly environment and your co-workers will be there to help you. Everyone does work as a team. You will learn a lot about home improvement, there are TONS of classes and on the job training that is required along the way. Co-workers are like any other place, you will have people you love and people you may not like as much, but it's a big enough place and professional enough to avoid any situation that is uncomfortable. Breaks are given freely and regulated, and they do tend to work around your schedule, which is a bonus. Pay is not great...probably low. The hardest part of the job is just to learn all of the different departments and home improvements options they have, most enjoyable part would be the co-workers you work with."
bad,"The rewards and benefits are great, but really doesn't have that ""family"" feel that some claim. But not the worse place to work."
bad,Little Investment in employees. Fragmented relations between departments.
bad,Good place to work for a part time job. Wouldn't recommend trying to make a career out of it
bad,I was fired over speaking against racism.
bad,when you are working by yourself. management is ok but they dont know there products.
bad,Really did not feel like they had a work/life balance. Wish they would go to shifts where full-timers could work days and part-timers filled in. Would make the full-timers feel they could have the best pick of the hours and not 'available 24/7'. Our store was shut down. Management in our market was not the greatest
bad,not family friendly work hours.no insentives.benefits to expensive.does not take care of personal
bad,"Their management is very poor, their scheduling is terrible for regular associates, and if you end up in disciplinary action for anything they make extremely biased and false judgements against you. Do not recommend unless you're incredibly desperate."
bad,It‚Äôs been a month and have yet to receive proper training. Support staff treats you like they can‚Äôt be bothered. I have 9+ years of experience and they only start me out at $12 an hour. It‚Äôs not worth it if you already have experience.
bad,culture at workplace has changed dramatically over the past couple of years....the company has gone from what some would consider a extended family environment to one of dog eat dog and look after yourself mentality...it is to bad.
bad,"I‚Äôve been working at Lowe‚Äôs as an unloader for about a month now and everyday it gets more and more annoying to be apart of the company. When it comes to unloading a truck, we have a certain time window in which we have to finish said truck and then pull the freight to it‚Äôs respected isle by the end of the night; it‚Äôs fairly easy but the problem that I‚Äôve had is the lack of hours. I‚Äôm only getting  about 20 hours in two weeks.... TWO weeks. That‚Äôs very little and I‚Äôve tried to ask for more hours and even made it clear that I am available to come in if anyone was needed yet they just duly note me and move on. Another thing that‚Äôs annoying is that I‚Äôve asked and asked about hours yet they always say they don‚Äôt need help and that the company is trying to cut back on giving people hours and what not. I have an aunt who works at the cashiers and she‚Äôs always telling me about how hectic it gets and how there is usually no one at the cashiers to help her out and the lines end up getting long and busy, but apparently ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äù what a joke. I‚Äôve asked for more training for a cashier or stocker Incase they needed me and wanted to me to do training but I haven‚Äôt heard back, so I doubt I‚Äôll get it. On top of all that, since Lowe‚Äôs has this whole time table planned out on how long it‚Äôll take to unload a truck depending on the number of unloaders and how big it is, managers expect you to finish at the given time and then head home, rarely do I get to stay and make more hours. That‚Äôs why I usually end up taking my time to try to make up for hours but then I have managers on"
bad,"It was stressful working a different shift each day. Extremely difficult to plan anything outside of work."
bad,You have to stay on top of your schedule because they change it almost daily without notification to you so if you have any plans dont set them until you know. They dont train you properly for any of the other departments but will make you cover it anyway and when you loosr a sale because you don't know anything about the department they look at you like you did something wrong. Terrible man
bad,Required to work lots of hours. No work life balance - all about the company profiting and less about family. Upper mgmt just wants results and don‚Äôt care what they have to do to get them. Make decisions without including employees who are most affected by them. The company protects bad store leaders. My store manager did not care about developing the leaders only himself. Lack of training in positions but high expectations.
bad,Lowes is having a hard time finding itself. They are changing constantly and not consentrating on anything important. Employee experience is not important.
bad,"Lowes is a business of not what you know but who. If you are exceptional at a certain position, upper management locks you in and there is no place for advancement. You can't lateral or transfer to a different store."
bad,Days included a variety of meetings with members of different teams throughout the organization. Company always in-flux. Takes a long time to implement change. Constant turn-over especially in management.
bad,"Lowe's home improvement offers excellent pay and amazing benefits, as well as supportive coworkers.  However, the use of outside hires as the sole holders of authority within a store is foolish and the cause for their stagnating sales.  Our assistant store managers would never lead by example; instead, it was ""let's blame my poor management on the lesser manager"" which would lead to a spiral of finger-pointing.  Working at Lowe's will bring back memories of high school, because that is the best analogy to describe the constant manager-""associate"" drama within a store.  Like any blue collar job, Lowe's is guilty of the constant promising of ""yeah you will for sure land the promotion"" and yet the promotion never comes.  All in all, it is your choice to work for Lowe's, but you will either love it or hate it."
bad,on a day to day bases you might have to redo something you've already done that took hours. for example move all lawn mowers  to the front but by the next day they want them all back in the back.
bad,"My experience went well. It's physical, easy, fun work. Lied of starting pay. Many good and bad people. Management needs a do over. Don't rely on Lowe's. On company level, things change constantly, so jobs come and go, rules change, so it's always the, ""corporate is stupid"" kind of change."
bad,"I was part-time. seasonal months are the only times your given decent hours. When I left I was making $11 an hour, but only seen a $500+ paycheck maybe 3 -5 times a year and I worked there 3 years. Management is a joke and trying to go above their heads is even worse. Their benefits changed. All managers and CEO get bonus' employees have such high expectations to meet that we never got bonus' and they raised it every year. They took away set hours and availability. They keep taking away job titles which put people out of a job. This company is selfish and doesn't care about their empolyee's at all"
bad,"Typical day starts with clearing floor, then its assisting customers while contacting management, the management seems to be lacking, culture is great depending on the staff in the building. Hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people."
bad,"Management is rarely familiar with the home improvement business, does not respond well to employee suggestions or requests, chasm between corporate and daily wok experience."
bad,No communication between management and employees. Understaffed on a daily basis. This is a labor intensive job. Absolutely no time to slow down. I would often have to cover multiple departments while being short staffed in my department.
bad,"Unfortunately employees have to learn as they go. This can be very frustrating to customers. There is no organization and employees show up just about whenever they want/do not want to. Great employee benefits, however."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of making sure all the customer could find and get what they needed weather we had to order or just help find it in the store."
bad,"When I started this job originally years ago the culture was completely different than what it is now, and it is taking a turn for the worse, the job used to treat everyone as a family and the management team genuinely cared for each and every employee. Currently though, with the installation of a new CEO we have swapped to a more ""customer focused"" mindset which leaves the employees alone to fend for themselves. Employees used to love going into work everyday, and now they come into work each day to get a paycheck and get out as soon as possible. Also related to this is the massive increase in both employee dissatisfaction and employee turnover with the new changes that upper management is rolling out."
bad,"Pay is good but could be better for work preformed"
bad,"Every manager works differently and it is hard to just get them to be a team. "
bad,It's a good place to work but manager stays on your back just do your work when you get finished your department  they will send you to help some else if they need it
bad,"While the culture of Lowe's is extremely friendly as the people I worked with were very enjoyable, the pay was not enough to live off of. I felt as though extra work was not given more thought than a congratulations and doing less work seemed to be ignored. "
bad,"A retail job with lots of customer interaction, most positions require the employee to handle many responsibilities across different departments and learn a variety of skills."
bad,I was in recieving people take advantage of the lack of supervision if your unloading dont expect any help lots of good people a few people were pretty miserable
bad,"They don‚Äôt allow you to stop & talk to anyone even for a second, In order to help another team member you have to ask for permission.  Harassed & treated like you don‚Äôt work hard. Management tries/pretends to be your friend and promises you jobs or rotations, then go behind your back and try to get you fired. The pay and benefits are great better then any other job I‚Äôve had, but I‚Äôd give it all up to work at a place that doesn‚Äôt treat you like garbage. But this is just one of many opinions."
bad,"I come in to work and go home"
bad,"Personally I don‚Äôt enjoy Lowe‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a good start to retail for me but not somewhere I personally would like to stay for long, managers are fairly two faced and throw you under the bus occasionally"
bad,"Too many issues to write out. Main problem is hiring from outside. No commission for sales. Working retail hours. Catering to unbelievable customers who act like babies to get their way when the store will clearly lose money which in turn comes out of the bonus fund for employees. Only whole store gets a bonus, not individuals no matter how hard you work."
bad,The job was great for all the people I got to meet and work with but the managers and there work ethics were one of the worst I have experienced. They lie to get the workers to do work and give no support. I would not recommend working there
bad,I pulled this Lowes Store out of deficit and was treated badly when I seen something wrong going on. Very ungrateful store can't speak on company but this store South Kansas City is the worst ever. And if you part ways they black ball your career.
bad,a regular job that has its ups and downs. I quit because of management and inconsistent hours. Very boring and managers had pointless rules that didn't make sense at all.
bad,"Like most places, if you are in the click and are well liked, you pretty much get what you what.  If you are not particularly favored you will find there is another standard for you.  People with no experience in a area, can get the position they want, while someone with years of experience will be rejected.  Also, I found out, accidently, that someone I worked with was doing the same job as me.  He was getting paid more.  I went to HR and had to make a big production to get the same pay, for the same job, with the same amount of experience"
bad,"This was an amazing company when I started, things have really changed. I feel management doesn't listen to their associates. As most employees  say were just a warm body.lol  There are a lot of amazing employees within this company whom they just overlook."
bad,Very corporate in nature and not what I was used to.  I loved working in the garden center.  I loved working in installed sales but did not like the retail schedule of weekends and holidays.
bad,Little to no help.
bad,"i had a great time working and meeting new peop!e. It was a fast paced job at times, but if you are able to keep up then you can enjoy as well.  I miss my Lowes family"
bad,"Days are inconsistent as the schedule could be night, morning, mid shift, or even an overnight. An employee could work a closing shift then be scheduled for a morning shift the very next day. Any position could be eliminated at any time. Most liked employees, not the best, are more likely to be promoted, and raises are inconsistent to the work you have achieved. Management changes like the wind and the best managers are usually sent away. The pay was ok, but the work load kept getting larger. There are way too many things to include for this company, most are negative, but there are a few positive things."
bad,Lowe's is a great place to work the hours are amazing and they are very family oriented and very understanding when it comes to time off and your needs.
bad,"Worked a ton, Management was not good. Overtime everyday, no time at home. Management tried to fire me for no reason. Only at my store location though."
bad,"The management has their favorites and they aren't afraid to let you know it.  If you are not a ""favorite"" you have no chance of advancement and your job gets threatened for no reason.  Also no one trains the same and you get in trouble for not knowing what they want."
bad,I never intended on making a career out of lowes. Im an engineering graduate looking for a job in my field. Working at lowes (in flooring) is very physically demanding and honestly I hate customer service. We have a great store full of good employees and management is good but im getting sick of lugging 60lb boxes of tile around for 8 hours a day while taking you know what from idiot customer.
bad,"A pretty slow store, you wont see much action as an associate. I have worked here since before they restructured the company (fired managers, promoted others, in order to save money) and can honestly say there has been a huge downfall in the quality of management. A lot of underqualified service managers on a power trip who don't know how to do their job, let alone have working knowledge of the departments they oversee. They are quick to criticize when you do wrong and give no positive reinforcement when you do right. Little training is given, if you end up dealing with customers' big ticket orders expect to hear customers' frustration at how rough the process is due to lack of communication and misguided uninformed associates. Upside of working here is that pay is good and medical benefits are pretty good."
bad,"This job can be very stressful, I'm not sure if it was just the management, but they do not understand when you need to take off because of school or appointments."
bad,"Great place to work, great team members, upper Management needs to take a look at themselves and should backup what they say. Keep good people working"
bad,"I worked for Lowe's Corporate Office for 3 years. My manager during the first 2 years was horrible. He had his favorites and the people that were his favorites got the perks of Lowe's. When he left, a new manager was assigned to the team and he was AMAZING!!! Always wanted to see his team learn and grow. Huge reorg going on, so all they are hiring now are contractors for lesser pay. Sucks because they let go of really good people on .com & mobile."
bad,The company is eliminating positions getting ready to go online only no retail locations. so only apply for warehouse positions when they start opening those
bad,"Lowe's company as a whole offers great benefits, paid holiday and vacation days. Lowe's don't care about it's tenured employees. I have found this to be true for years."
bad,Me and the company just wasn't a right fit for each other. There views on things and mine was totally different. We had a very difficult time adjusting to each other and that made things hard to work there.
bad,"very understaffed, no family life because of rotating schedule..no set work schedule, most of the time employees are scheduled at night alone and have to cover 2 to 3 departments all at once."
bad,The management at Lowes was not the best. It was hard to do my job correctly when they didn't update us on system changes or current promotions etc. The environment however was nice and positive.
bad,I enjoyed working for Lowes it was an experience to be able to help customers with their needs at the store. I learned a lot and got certified with different machinery. There was very good opportunity for advancement. but had to leave because of school schedule.
bad,"Fun place to work, co-workers were like family. Work place culture huge on team work. You do work some holidays but receive floating holidays,sick and vacation time."
bad,"On a typical day, im being yelled at by someone. Whether its a customer or a supervisor. My co workers expect things to be handed to them most times and in turn i have to do extra work. Im only holding down this job until i can get a new one."
bad,I worked 4 ten hour days and had a three day weekend.  I learned a lot about the Distribution Center and how they operate.  The management was a bit unfair at times.  The hardest part of the job was the management treated me unfairly and bypassed me when it came to overtime.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and the hours
bad,"Happy to be out of that environment.  The quality ofassociates/management has extremely deminished. Lowe's as a company has to have the worst talent retention I have come across.  They are more concerned with saving $ than providing useful, knowledgeable, and loyal employees."
bad,Severely understaffed and had been for years now even with hiring new people which has created a fairly toxic work environment. Very little communication between management and employees and even between managers themselves.
bad,"Good day at work interactive with the costumer as a bilingual person who speaks, read and write English and Spanish typing 40 words or minute no problem what so ever to get in charge or trine new candidates as need."
bad,"At first you are being told that you are the best cashier you have seen in years, averaging 25% close rates for protections, good for 1st in the department and 4th in the store and that you are going to be moved up. to being on a team to was to be the top cashiers to being told you got looked over for a guy the pushes carts."
bad,"When I started working there the store was running great, but after a change in management and cutbacks the store didn't even have enough employees to run the store efficiently so you would end up working other people's jobs."
bad,Loved working at Lowes when I was seasonal and part time. Going full time was a completely different story I was the loader and every manager had a different opinion on my job description. It made working at lowes very frustrating. All in allI learned a lot about building materials and lumber and Couldn't ask for more knowledgeable co workers.
bad,"To work at Lowe's depends on how the management works at that particular location. If you are liked by your management you can work there as long as you want but if there is any kind of disturbance then it is hard to continue work no matter how sincere and punctual you are at your work."
bad,A very nice place to work pays well and a good work environment. People there are very nice and respectful. Management takes good care of their employees.
bad,Fast-Paced setting that will teach you all there is to learn about retail. Great place to work while going to school since they are flexible with the schedules.
bad,managers dont treat u well they are not there when you need them .also they dont respect u .they are only ther for you when higher management come to the store to vist
bad,"The job was great especially the set schedule Monday through Friday. It kept me busy which was great, mad the day go by fast. The only downside was the management. If there was a problem, they didn't want to know about it or help remedy the situation. It was definitely a culture of who you know and who you're friends with that determined how you were treated."
bad,"Go in at 5 am get the freight out to the floor and make sure that everyone is working the freight to the shelves. Also receive in trucks throughout the day and make sure that gets put on the shelves as well."
bad,"Keep your head down and dont have an opinion. "
bad,Lowes would over load us with appliances push us to hard the system was so mess up we would bring back appliances that people did not want it was go go go all the time.
bad,"Lowe's should be a good job, but the trainers have a little trouble with the IMPACT sales model. The job should be easier than it is, but most of the managers are not really committed to IMPACT."
bad,"Working at Lowe's was easy and most of the employees and even the customers were nice, but the pay wasn't that great, I didn't get as many hours as I wanted and there was little to no room for advancement. This is a good job to have if you need extra money, but if you're looking for a job to advance in or make a decent paycheck I would look somewhere else."
bad,"There is a serious communication problem at this store. Was hired as a front end cashier however was always put down in lumber or outside garden. That's ok I'm a go with the flow kind of girl until you expect me to work in nasty weather conditions!!! They seem to pamper the less experienced and work the he double lll out of stronger cashiers. Very unfair!!!! Over all I loved my work and co-workers . If you had issue with one manager they all turned on you. Forget about a life while working here because your schedule will be all over the place. Oh and forget about trying to talk to your coworkers because you will be told to shut up!!!! And last but not least....I didn't mind working weekends because Sunday the store was only opened 8am to 7pm. Well imagine my surprise when I was scheduled to work to 8:00pm!!!! That's right ,they would make us stay 1 hour after store closed to go help all the other departments!!! Mind you NONE of this was mentioned to me at anytime during my hiring process!!! If you like surprises go ahead and work here otherwise just continue to shop here. I was very disappointed at the way they handled my departure."
bad,"Depends on location, management can be difficult. If full time employee, the distinction between work-life can be blurred. Overall, good company."
bad,To be honest this company was good at first i loved coming into work and learning new things and enjoying the company of my co workers and the customers. Than the years passed and the management got worst and I decide to leave.
bad,"Good benefits, but if they dont like you they will let you go,no matter how much you try. they play favorites at this place. would not tell anyone to work there"
bad,Too much favoritism and the managers are not consist...managers are not on the same page.... The manager lets the Human resource manager has too much say so..
bad,"not the greatest of jobs, just a lot of work, with not very good pay. good for a college student or someone who would like to jump up in the company after a decent amount of time.."
bad,Don't ever work here. This place was terrible. Management sucks. Pay sucks. Hours suck. I would strongly discourage anybody from working here ever.
bad,Fun environment to work in. Great staff and managers. Giving them great customer service and being a cashier making sure they leave happy.
bad,A great place to work if you are in school and need a part time job. Everyone who i work with are really nice. The job as a cashier is really easy.
bad,"Training for the job is mediocre at best. You can only excel at this job with a decent tenure or real household repair experience."
bad,"Come in building, Clock in, put on vest, fill water bottle, ask head cashier where I am needed if slow, if busy get on empty register and start checking people out. "
bad,They promote within and pay a decent wage. Lowes is a great place to try to start a career but be aware because anyone is replaceable.
bad,"A typical work day a Class A delivery driver at Lowes includes checking your deliveries for the day and planning the best and efficient routes for the day. "
bad,"""customer is always right""  policy taken to extremes when associates has no rights in defending ones self of any accusations made by customers.  Pay is competitive, advancements very difficult however not impossible if your your the right place at the right time and decision making store manager and/or HR person has to like you. Lowe's encourages other associates to report to management every minor infarction of other associates that could  lead eventually to termination which does not make for friendly work environment."
bad,"A typical day at work was spent looking for things to do between customers, trying to help customers in someone else's department while it's associates were in another department grouped together talking about how wasted they got last night and when the next party was."
bad,"A great place with great people to work with, but advancement is limited and the pay is not the best for the hard work that we do. Continuous heavy lifting in a building with a constant 80 degree temperature is the biggest drawback."
bad,Only a few good people out of 120 workers. The management team is rarely on one accord so the rest of the associates have to suffer. The hardest part of this job is having no backup.
bad,its okay. looking for something else because its not me anymore.
bad,"Management says be consistent in all disciplinary actions in department, yet upper management has favorites and are not consistent."
bad,"a lot, they expect a lot from you without training....."
bad,fun place to work but very low wages. do not like to promote younger worker to management positions
bad,Everyone believes in teamwork!! they will work with you and try and help with anything..
bad,"It is hard to balance a family or social life with this company. Lowe's opens early and closes late, especially in the spring."
bad,"Selling seven products lines in-home to residents of southern NH."
bad,This is a pretty good job for a high school student. When I worked here management was not great.
bad,Misleading about the amount of hours promised versus amount given. 
bad,"Lowes alone has a VERY HIGH moral which I believe in. Lowes #465 was a ten year store. No top out wage rate..."
bad,My job was to unload trucks and keep the receiving area clean
bad,"A typical day starts with a visit to my locker, to get my vest. The lockers are in the breakroom..... And so are half of the store employees... ""On break""... At 6:00 a.M. 3 Hours later when I take a break, guess who's in the breakroom? Yep, same ""breakers"" as before. And the day goes on. Management knows this, allows this, and it bites. They (mgmt.) Bite. The management at my store was so freakin weak. One thing they did enforce... Slave driving the fraction of employees that work. The best part of the job is my customers."
bad,"would not recommend unless desperate. High stress no reward, employees will take constant criticism and are constantly told they are never working hard enough."
bad,"Worked as a sale specialist for 4 years. Not alot of job opportunities in my area. The hardest part of my job was it was same old, same old every day. Not many challanges. Enjoyed working with customers."
bad,"Managment was more concerned with gossiping about other employees than actually being managers. tried to be your friends, and then when they got information ran to other employees to gossip. good pay. hard to advance in lowe's. if you're in one position and want to transfer to another department, they tell you they cant lose you in your current position."
bad,"Driving equipment loading and unloading trailers and taking stuff to and from the product racks. I learned to drive equipment and the basics of how a distribution center runs. I loved my co-workers, I met some great friends there. The hardest part of the job would be how cold it was in the building, and when I would ask to get transferred to a truck to load it so I could warm up, they would just keep me on equipment which being on the equipment was the easiest part of working there."
bad,No home life job did not care about its employees just make the money and that it.
bad,Spending 8 hours on concrete floors is difficult. There is a lot of information to learn and the compensation in low.
bad,"A typical work day at Lowes durning the winter, would consist of the (garden) associate ensuring that they have the proper (PPE), supplying costumers with the proper assistance to make their experience at Lowes the best."
bad,The company often listened to the employees and the only complaint that I had was then not stocking the store with enough employees in order to have it run in good fashion
bad,The pay was good started at 12.12 an hour as a cashier  cash register system is the worst and most complicated I have ever seen  management was nice but seemed rather clueless on the rules about anything at all  if you smoke be prepared to clock out for fifteen minute breaks and be ready to leave Lowe‚Äôs property to smoke a cigarette you cannot smoke in your car in the parking lot you are only allowed to drink water while on the clock
bad,I have worked at Lowe's for almost two years starting pay was 10.41 I'm only making $11 now some managers are good other managers don't really care but they're mostly want people for the business that are available all the time and if you're not then I just don't really care about you or don't really give you a lot of hours either but as far as people you work with the ones I work with are awesome and all very supportive and are really good friends
bad,Working at Lowe's provided me with a lot of information when it pertained to hands-on work. It also provided a lot of information for the future when i decide to become a home owner.
bad,"Associates are low man on the totem pole management used to be great and is now terrible, once the store manager left that location went into turmoil lots of managers left to different locations. When they cut 1% of the company managers had to take on new departments they knew little about, I left about a year later and would never go back, go to Home Depot"
bad,"The management here is poor. They're always overstaffed or understaffed. They don't care about their workers. I was only a seasonal worker, and couldn't even stay that long. It was so unbearable."
bad,Lowe's used to offered a very flexible work schedule which was what I needed for school. They no longer do that which makes it very difficult for me to balance out my life. Pay is also not the best.
bad,"While working here I was constantly given different directions by management who would publicly humiliate me for following one managers direction over the other. There is no support from management at all. Have a question? Figure it out yourself. Need more training? Too bad. Need to take time off? Denied. I will say that the pay is very fair, taking in consideration your education and experience. If you can stand to be in that kind of toxic environment, the pay is fair."
bad,"Managment was terrible, zero communication throughout the store. I worked at 2 different locations in two different states and they both lacked knowledge on customer service. Really sad!"
bad,Communication and help could be used more. Computer systems were glitching. Shifts were easy to move around. Jobs were assigned by department manager.
bad,Can‚Äôt really accommodate to your availability even if it‚Äôs been changed. You have to beg until you make them bad and they finally do something. Management is OK.. but could definitely use a lot of work. Sucky response time when calling customer service especially when they‚Äôre not busy. Employees just get lazy .. witnessed it first had almost every day.
bad,I worked at Lowe's for a summer between semesters at college. The job was fine and the people were nice but it did not feel like I was valued as much as other employees because I was seasonal. The store did not make enough to provide overtime for employees though I was always worked as much as they legally could.
bad,Lowes is an alright place to work and has good benefits. The pay is definitely not the best but some of the work is truly enjoyable most of the time. 1
bad,My available time to work changed. I was part time. My Full time job hours changed and lowes could not work with me on changing my hours. The management was terrible and when I was working at lowes in Frederick I was treated terrible by management
bad,Did not have a great experience working with Lowe‚Äôs. Management was never sure of things going on along with changing schedules without letting the associates know.
bad,I'm tried to get back on wont hire because I can't work evenings so they won't hire me..so I don't even shop there now.I never missed work and good employee
bad,"ive worked here going on 6 years and about 6 months ago our store manager was fired and replaced. Besides the fact that CEO is intentionally running the company into the ground, the new SM is a money hungry tyrant who puts all the managers on a pedestal and makes everyone else their lackies. I used to be so proud of my team and where I worked but now I go in each day more frustrated than the day before. Ive watched once happy thriving people become so full of resentment and exhaustion that they‚Äôve lost their quality of life. Bottom line is, yes you‚Äôll get paid, but don‚Äôt sell your work ethic and stability."
bad,If you're trying to get your foot in the door to get some work experience under your belt then look no further than any Lowe's Home Improvement store.
bad,"I've worked delivery almost two years at this point, an let me tell you, it's a pain. Exited at first, slowly realized delivery gets treated like dirt. Expected to fix others mess ups, work well past your shift, an deal with customers mad over some else's screw up. An as of now, delivery might be going away in store, so I'm looking for another job, so I don't have to deal with them again."
bad,It was a very good company to work for they took care of me I couldn‚Äôt for a better place to work for but unfortunately I was just a seasonal employee
bad,"Some of the managers are employee oriented, but alot are not.  It is mostly about them and their bonuses.  Most don't seem to have a clue what needs to be done to make it a top notch store."
bad,"Decent job, decent pay, nice co workers, good benefits, decent schedule, poor management, I enjoyed working there until the new manager wanted to show his position off."
bad,Good company to work with friendly co workers.they work with you around your schedule. If you‚Äôre looking for a job to move around and be in more than one spot and help others Lowe‚Äôs is a good place to start.
bad,The way Lowe's is run has really gone downhill they seem to care less and less about employees. Pay is not bad for retail but expect to be doing a lot more then you should because they don't hire people. The store is basically a ghost town when it comes to finding employee. Overall I wouldn't work there again. And that's coming from someone who used to love this store.
bad,It is a fast paced environment. Some days it can be a great place to work but many days there is a lack of communication and some times it is hard to find people that are motivated to be there and help.
bad,Not near enough hours to pay bills so I need to leave to find a different job to where I can get the hours I need to be able to pay my bills and live comfortably instead of worrying about money constantly
bad,"I worked there for almost two years with next to nothing for pay raises, and was expected to train new CSA's that were making more on the hour than I was to do goof off and not take my training seriously. I watched them fire 2 valuable employees for what I felt to be nonsensical reasons right before they could retire from the company."
bad,It‚Äôs not a bad job. Management just wasn‚Äôt the best. They would always change my schedule randomly. Not to mention without letting me know. I‚Äôve tried to move up to a new position but management is too focused on other things.
bad,Benefits  are good.  Don't  expect  to move  up unless  you are a favorite.   They hire from outside  instead  of in store.   Human resources  does  not exist  in store it's  online only.   Good luck  reaching a human.  Shifts are on rotation so sleeping  and eating are messed up every week.  Coworkers  are amazing.   Pay is good for new employees.   They come in making  more then  employees  that have been there 10 years or more
bad,"Not a job you can live off for part timers . Really Slow in the winter so means not enough hours for part timers, couple head cashiers super unprofessional"
bad,"the management in store is awesome, but once you reach the upper corporate levels, the management is useless. "
bad,"Lowes is a great company as a whole but it really depends on the individual "
bad,When I first started I always had positive things to say about this company. I would always recommend it because the company was strong had a great epic to the people that work there. Always felt like a family. Towards the end of my career the company changed the stores and the people changed. They were copying your biggest competitor with the policies and procedures. Fighting for their survival and losing their identity as a company. Always they seem to care about was making money and forgot about the people that they served and the people that work there
bad,"Most of the mangers at this store is what makes it, not a good place to work. Many employees are over worked and the ones that have been there the longest don't do much at all. "
bad,"Working at Lowe's can be very stressful as it is a very fast paced environment, however it can also be rewarding. At the end of the day the staff comes together as a team to help each other succeed where they are lacking. It also gave me many opportunities to expand my skill set and increase my knowledge of various home improvement information. Lowe's helped my hone my customer service abilities and increase my various skills with computers, data entry, and sales/refunds experience. It also taught me how to handle high stress situations which may require some strategizing and problem solving. Lowe's is a good place to start out and gain some work experience as well as expand your skill set."
bad,"I worked outside watering the plants. First of all they took a whole month before I received my red vest, secondly the man who trained me was very disrespectful and rude. What broke the ice for me and made me want to quit was the unfair pay. I found out that my fellow coworker was making $12.55 an hour instead of 11.46 an hour like me. I found it completely unfair so I left. I will NEVER work for Lowe‚Äôs ever again."
bad,No comment on this company. I worked there 13 years but haven't been there for over 2 years because of family related issues. Helped family members dealing with health related issues.
bad,"I spent 13 years with this company, for about 5 of those years I did traveling merchandising (product service). The years I spent traveling were great somewhere different each day, paid travel time, and a pretty decent mileage check. When the company did away with this job it wasn‚Äôt nearly as good. Lowes or at least the few stores I have worked in were very clickish, and you really had to watch the two faced coworkers. Last but not least, management for the most part is a huge joke. There are a handful that are actually decent and have their employees backs, then there are the ones who will do whatever it takes to save their own tail."
bad,"Started working at Lowe's 2yrs ago and it was fun and there were nice ppl. Now, if want to move up in position you have to brown nose to do so. Majority of the time they already know who they want in any given position before you even apply or get an interview. The hours suck. They expect you to be available anytime if you are full time, so forget about seeing your family."
bad,"Pay was good, but not a good training program and work environment not very pleasant.  The customers were great, co-workers were very difficult with exception of a few."
bad,It is a place that takes advantage of anyone willing to spend an extended amount of time there. They work you hard with minimal breaks and almost no element of teamwork or collaborative effort .
bad,"Scheduling here is atrocious, have been scheduled against my availability multiple times."
bad,It was an okay job mostly because of the wage I was being paid. There would be a lack of staff to relieve you for your lunch breaks. Staff was always short. The managers would never talk to you only send messages through your head cashier.
bad,I honestly didn‚Äôt like Lowe‚Äôs . This job gave me the opportunity to save some money for the summer time. I didn‚Äôt like this job because I was mainly outside pulling carts in the heat almost everyday.
bad,"Poor management, lack of accountability, poor wages for experience, low store moral, terrible benefits, bringing in new hires at higher wages than current employees"
bad,"Once the managers knorw you are a hard worker you, they will put you to work and make you do their job for them. Management sucks at store 0701. Every one their is on a power trip."
bad,"Everyone is just a number, with a quota attached. They take, take & take and drain the life from you. "
bad,Dont like.it its gettting worst and not a good place more strict stupid things they do and yes i didnt likenit after 4 years and i was happy to go with lay off
bad,This is a nice job but the job was to slow for me and they didn't want to pay for when you get hurt in a truck or you make a report about a manger or co worker they don't following
bad,"it was a fun job, but the pay was too little for me , getting paid 500 every two weeks is not enough at all. This job is for young people who don't mind making a lot, cause they just want a job."
bad,Don‚Äôt get me wrong it wasn‚Äôt a bad job but like I said when people started quitting they didn‚Äôt bother hire anyone its a really hard to do your job when you need someone spotting you to use the power equipment which I never had  meaning you only have an hour to use power equipment when the store closes  and it‚Äôs pretty hard to do all that work in one hour
bad,Work can be fun but I often found that my work was not valued. I also had a manager tell me that I was expendable and Lowe's would make money with or without me. That may have been true but why would you speak to your employee that way?
bad,"Was run by inexperienced manager, that used his personal differences and inside helpers to rule in his manner only. Seen a lot of Great Home Town Workers get fired that had been there for years, and kept the Local customers coming back. We will drive to Winchester from now on to Home Depot  In small towns like Woodstock, you have a lot of hometown people that got it started and stuck with it. No a young gun from somewhere else shows up and fires his hometown people and hires a bunch of hotrods with fast cars and no loyalty. They don't care about what the people here want, and thats faces they know and trust. The younger people should be faised in under the supervision of the people that have been there for a while. Thats how i was trained, by old timers, not hot rods."
bad,Great Benefits. Terrible management. Not proactive. Unresponsive. Workplace culture is average. Seniority rules the roost. Managers are for the most part not willing to get involved. Variations vary wildly by store. Plan on feeling like a number.
bad,"Bosses stress on greeting customers and focusing on one customer at a time to fully help them, but department is always understaffed and I am often working entire shifts alone. When new hires do come in, hours are cut because the store is over hours vs sales. Coworkers are generally great, though, and we all try to work together."
bad,"I applied and was hired. They mess with your schedule, they claim to not get outside emails but got them in the past. They hire too many people then cut the hours of people that have worked their before the new hires. Was let go for no reason oh I remember I could not work 8 plus hours on FRIDAY/Saturday an Sunday. Um they knew I had another job prior to getting this job. "
bad,"You are just a number, more focused on the company then the staff. Not much room for pay increase and they pay minimal. Ok job if looking to get a pay check and just starting off."
bad,"As a employee who was assaulted by another employee, sexually, I went straight to someone higher up. They did begin an investigation, however they kept the employee in the same department as I was in and never recommended moving either one of us to a different department so they can get to the bottom of it. Since I felt uncomfortable half the time, I decided to leave."
bad,as a worker at customer service you were made to deal with a lot of people who wanted to return items that were obviously previously stolen from the store with managers looking over your shoulder making sure you did everything right.
bad,Managers were so inconsiderate of your needs and slow about helping you. Co-workers weren't as talkative during breaks and distant mostly. No good training available to move up.
bad,"To achieve all level of expectations,meet new people ,to be very well trained.a member of the safety groups.to help in the community .to lead all expectations and to be a servant to my associates. To be in the best in every aspect for the whole team"
bad,12 hours a day of loading 80 plus pound items floor to ceiling in trailers got very tiring even at a young age. Not much concern for safety or havung human decency.
bad,"Management unable to control actions of employees. For example, merchandise already sold, and ""on hold"", often removed for storage, and sold again without being reordered.   This practice was brought to management's attention many times, but never corrected in my two years with Lowes."
bad,Expect you to wear many hats for low pay.  The moral stunk.  The Store Manager was a tyrant with constant mood swings.  There are some good people there.  Management could have been better.  Only a few bad apples.
bad,"I was working as a forklift operator. The training was rushed through, and at the time one person was training several. Was hard to get good training."
bad,"I learned a tremendous amount about nearly every department from the long time employees. My immediate managers were very supportive, but corporate only saw us as numbers and not human beings."
bad,Lowes taught me a lot about surviving in the work place and coming in to work everyday as hard as possible. The environment was very dull at times which took its toll on the employees.
bad,Very good working experience. Easy to interact with customers. Very Slowed paced but very effective. Learned a lot from older workers. Would recommened a friend to work there.
bad,"Management needs to be changed. Very poor at communicating with their employees. Not enough machine operators in store. Store is a mess, product placement is never correct either."
bad,"If you watch what Home Depot did 3-5 years prior to today, you can see if you like their business model for store side employees.For Corporate level jobs it's about getting a foot in the door. After that it's politics, mostly."
bad,Nice place to work but need some improvement in the manner department that will help improve the every day work on the floor that will things more better
bad,Would enjoy a place on employment that respects its employees. Working 4x as many departments as the rest some coworkers is unacceptable. Pay was very reasonable
bad,"It would be very slow sitting in 113F weather for 4 hours before getting a 30 min lunch just to sit in 113F heat, my arms gave out one day when loading 80 bags of 80pound topsoil into a truck immediately after loading 40 bags of 40 pound fertilizer into a separate truck but they wouldn't let me stop for a minute to regain my strength. Pay was okay though for your typical first job out of the house."
bad,"To start When I started lowes a year ago it was very unorganized and still is to this day but getting better. Working in CPO is the most stressful thing ever! The ONLY thing I like about work was seeing my coworkers and our managers were caring but other than that you get calls from rude customers every single day, have to balance installers and handle your own workload. Everything gets pushed off and no one wants to handle the Call so they push it off until it comes to you! Lowes puts unrealistic expectations on their empoyees. Many employees leave for short term leave because this job screws with your mental health. It was horrible experience for me I just caution everyone to truly think about it before you accept this job, it's NOT what they tell you it will be at first. Oh and you work one 7 day work week rotating schedule every single week, no time for family if you have children. I could go on and on and on, no job is perfect but this one is not worth the stress just dodge the bullet. Although, I do sincelry appreciate some managers that actually care and take care of their people like our manager did! They always were truly their for support and my coworkers were really like my family."
bad,worked in the back unloading trucks and stocking product on shelves. good environment but senior staff not very helpful to new people. Not a whole lot of training or advancement opportunities
bad,"Nice place, employees are nice but management is nearly impossible to deal with.  I would not recommend working here to anybody unless they had absolutely no choice but to do so."
bad,It was basically like working in high school. If you do not mind being the odd one out as a seasonal and having people including managers make you uncomfortable for various reasons then work at lowes.
bad,"Hard work in very dirty warehouse environment. Attendance policy need work, company uses ""no-fault"" system that only allows for excused absences in the case of a death in your family."
bad,"Lowes isn't a bad place to work in terms of the actual labor and responsibilities of the job. In my opinion Lowes is a bad job because I don't believe the corporate office actually appreciates the contributions of its rank and file employees. I say this because in my experience at the store I saw many valued, productive employees lose their jobs due to corporate cutbacks on staff."
bad,"This job is simple; assist customers in finding what they're looking for, guide them toward products they may not have considered, sign people up for the credit program, and do whatever your managers tell you, even if each manager tells you a different task."
bad,"Was a great place to work when I first started.   Great environment and supportive.  Helped you to get better.  Toward the end the pressure of declining brick a mortor retail got to them and now it's a part time gig like any other retailer with no chance of advancement.  Only good thing was the amount of vacation time, but now they are getting rid of full time people and they don't treat employees as well as they used too.  Management now plays favorites."
bad,The people that worked their wasn't so friendly and didn't help new ppl out. They really don't appreciate the hard work the temps actually do. The pay wasn't that good either.
bad,"Working at Lowe's is very demanding and fast paced.  They were always working short handed which required even the part-timers to move from department to department, even if they don't know that department."
bad,"Management staff had gone thru a lot of changes and they are in the process of letting a lot of employees go, they are not very good at communication with the team"
bad,Used to be a much better place to work.  The recent restructuring of the managerial staff has caused more problems than solutions.  The promise of a 3rd party flatbed delivery program is icing on the cake.
bad,management is unfriendly and unprofessional. They don't really give you the opportunity to move up. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to leave.
bad,typical day at work was very busy with customers. I learned a lot about different projects and dealing with customers from all backgrounds. management  showed favoritism
bad,I liked working for lowes.  But my hours were always different every week so couldn't plan for anything.  Lots of late night hours and worked most weekends.
bad,Your are literally at work all the time. You never know from one day to the next when you will start your shift or when it will end. If your are salary you are at the mercy of the Store manager and have a work load of 3 people on you at all times with no support.
bad,I enjoyed my self when i worked there. the people were very nice. Job was fun. made a lot of new friends while working there. would go back. would recommend it.
bad,"Enjoyed working in the lawn & garden exploring all the different items that they carried throughout the store. Learned new things about items carried."
bad,I don't really have an opinion on Lowes.The company is noat a bad company but not one that I want to continue my career path with. Overall the company is decent to work for.
bad,My job was to drive the fortlift and stock the shelves and put pallet on beams or down stack from beams and to stock the empty spot and product and spot sweep floor and clean our  work area
bad,"Another company that only allows a limited few to move up in the company, generally only if you're friends of a manager do you get to go any where. Management is a joke."
bad,The Lowes business platform is basically designed to function no matter what type of employees work there. You are basically just a warm body there to provide the customer with a nice shopping experience.
bad,"I love my job, if the job I was hired for was what I had to do on a daily basis it would be perfect, but you end up covering for MULTIPLE other jobs to the point you fall extremely behind on your own. Management sees the credit coordinator position as free labor to cover anywhere and everywhere they need."
bad,"You could drink as much pop as you liked, student workers made it easy to make friends, as i was a student too. good time to learn customer service, and food handling skills."
bad,"Good benefits offered to employees and generally people our nice and fairly clean place to work. You will do a lot of walking if your in a specific department, otherwise if your a casher, you will be stationed at a register."
bad,"If you can become full-time, its a great place to work. If you are part time, its just mediocre. You learn a lot working there. If you need a job, I would suggest you apply."
bad,"Aprend√≠ r√°pido el sistema de administraci√≥n.  "
bad,If your looking for a good place to build you home it would be lowes. Working for lowes is a good working environment. You get to meet new people and help the improve there home.
bad,You go to work and you go home. There's not really a work life culture.The job is relatively low stress and easy going. Just keep a positive attitude
bad,Was a wonderful and engaging job that gave me great experience with customer service. One of the managers was always in a bad mood and was not nice to any of the employees.
bad,"Typical workday - steady work pace usually"
bad,"Good place to work, excellent benefits. Hours can be a little sketchy when the holidays are over. The management team is ok."
bad,"Nice people stays pretty busy during the day, but at times slow and not much going on and could not move around or help out else where had to stay put up front. And the hours and the schedules were pretty crumby."
bad,the co-workers are the bast part of the job because they keep the friendly flow of work coming and are all generally great people to work with
bad,I was only working there for about two weeks and I already had everything down. I even started to train some of the other employee's that didn't know stuff. The management loved how I was with the customers and wanted to train me in other departments. But later down the road when my availability changed they refused to work with me. They had rather me quit than work with my part time availability
bad,A typical day consisted of me preforming various activities in the outdoor lawn and garden section of the store.  I would assist customers and make sure the shelves were constantly organized.
bad,This was a great company to work for however it did not survive the changes in the lending industry.  There was a great group of people and a fun company to work for.
bad,"Due to changes in the lending industry this company did not survive the changes in our economy.  It was a great company to work for, with a great team of people."
bad,"corporation attitude, employees come and go, no trust in management and lack of communication. pay was better than expected."
bad,My co-workers make good teammates. Behind the scenes of what it takes to make a business like that work.At typical day at work is sorting and putting away stock.The hardest part is the heavy lifting. Completing my task.
bad,"easy job, management, pays better than most places like it. managers get power hungry but some are respectable and hard working honest people"
bad,worked the front end and it was always a fast paced job. had to run from the front end to the customer service desk to anywhere else you where needed. great co-workers but that could also be the hard part of the job. enjoyed going into work even when it was a rough day. management was good for most part but sometimes they could even get overwhelmed with too much being put on their shoulders and i liked being able to help them with whatever i could to make it easier
bad,"I feel that it could be a very nice place to work if management was a lot better! I enjoy interacting with the public, But this particular store does not carry the professionalism. Just being totally honest."
bad,"I would work on a cash register each day, in different departments. There was a lot of turn over, most of the employees were very  young and would anything to get out of working."
bad,"I am  hard working learn quickly,used to fast pace work.I manage many people and duties at one time.Looking for career job always willing to learn new things."
bad,I really didn't like working there because everybody to me was racist. maybe not but to my eyes they were. everyday I was sent home early cutting away more and more hours off my check just to give it to somebody else
bad,Although this is a well known and loved company the prices seem to always be a bit higher than competitors and the training for positions in this work place need major improvement.
bad,fun place to work for very rich area of Long Island New Yprk so very nice homes to work in the customer were a bit snotty cause they were so rich but it was fun.
bad,you never know what you will be doing from day to because it changes so fast. I learned that it is better to be quite and let the sup. tell you what to this it causes less problems then you can concentrate on your job at hand pleasing the custumers
bad,"The store is alright, the management could definitely be better but what can you do. A business is a business, a job is a job."
bad,"My responsibility in Lowes consist of pulling skids onto the floor, stocking , and zoning my departments. The hardest part of my job was working nights, but my co-workers were really good people."
bad,Not much to say about this employer other than its the typical Big Box retailer.  I suggest if you are considering applying that you proceed with caution.  Expect working most weekends and for little or no pay.  I think it also important to note that just a few years ago they used to pay more.
bad,"Working at Lowes offers an opportunity to earn great customer service experience. Along with the experience, you also work alongside great associates and management."
bad,"Learned a lot about management, which I will take with me to an employer that will value it. No work life balance, and unable to spend time with family on holidays."
bad,"The job is great, if you like working with the public and like to help people that depend on your knowledge. Co workers are great if not in a sales position because they just want sales. Only down fall is upper management does not care about hourly employees."
bad,"I loved my job there.  I liked waiting on customers, but did not like how the management showed blatant favoritism.  A lot of employees were overlooked for job postings in favor for others with less experience."
bad,Job description was changed as needed. Work hours were cut across the board on one days notice making continuing desire to be employed there marginal  and not cost effective
bad,basic retail environment some friendly coworkers some not so friendly. not many perks behind the job but regular steady work.
bad,"Unless you enjoy working with customers, it can be mind-numbing."
bad,"A typical day at Lowe's requires acknowledging each and every customer as you approach them regardless if your stocking, with another customer etc. I learned how to Inspect Cabinets, Carpet, Window, and Door Installations etc... It was fun meeting new people and learning new things as I moved up in the company. The hardest thing about working at Lowe's was nothing I enjoyed everything I did. The management team was awesome."
bad,"Overall working at Lowe's is about what you expect from any retail chain, however, they do not seem to promote from within the store leaving current employees feeling stuck and unmotivated."
bad,"Customer service is number one  "
bad,"to much drama"
bad,the customers were the main reason i worked there I built report with my customer unlike any other associate. the managers were fair and friendly. We had a great group of teammates
bad,"Working in Customer Service "
bad,Many people called out. Staff was normally short hand. Eventually people started quitting.
bad,I liked it there. I liked the pay and the benefits. I didnt like that they cut my hours to 11 hrs a week.
bad,Its an ok company but just dont get hurt on the job The managers are very one sided
bad,"All of my co-workers were easy to get along with and were all decent workers such as myself. My job title was a Delivery Driver/loader and unloader/ appliance installer. I enjoyed working there but my college class schedule conflicted with my work schedule so I had to relieve myself from that job, now I am In need of a new occupation."
bad,"As the summary says, Lowe's had the potential to be a great job. I worked with some great people, and had a good pay as head cashier. Unfortunately, the longer I stayed there, the more I began to dread going to work. I barely got trained, a lot of what I knew was self-taught, and many other people felt the same way. I was expected to be a mind-reading customer service extraordinaire, and was made to feel like garbage if I wasn't. Because I was the youngest head cashier, I was often made to feel stupid, or talked down to. It felt like the managers really had no clue what went on in the life of a cashier, or even a loader. "
bad,Advancement opportunities are there for those that work hard. Just a place to stop for a little while in your career journey. Don't become a lifer on the retail side.
bad,The prattville lowes is not managed well and undermine all employees. Also miss lead employees and costumers in all areas. not a very honest store
bad,A very moderate work pace! The customers were very fun to know!
bad,Help customers with wood selection for projects. Help load any equipment or merchandise for the customers.
bad,Not enough opportunity to grow due to changes that the company is taking on to grow market share. Employees are disengaged due to having no say or opportunity to help the company.
bad,"I'm a people person, so I enjoyed interacting with the customers.  Some co-workers were great and others ignorant, but that is what to expect whenever you have a diversity of people working together."
bad,"I helped cusomers, dealt with complaints, and orders. It was an experience. But I felt like I was not getting paid for my skills."
bad,"The hours bounced around a lot,the co workers had attitudes,there was no enjoyable part of this job."
bad,"Average retail store, a typical day at work. Coworkers are nice. The most enjoyable part of the day is when its time to go home."
bad,"-handling all customers in a friendly matter"
bad,"Job is excellent, working conditions are good, staff and management leave a lot to be desired."
bad,I've learned a lot about customer service/customer focus. My fellow co-workers and I work together as a team and share ideas. Which helps a lot and positive progress is always made that way each work day. There is nothing hard about my job I have been doing my job for a year now. From California upon transferring to Louisiana customers are keen.
bad,"See summary above. Ask current employees for more information. I'm sure they'd be happy to give you the ""untold truth"" behind working for a Fortune 100 company."
bad,"The people I worked with were great. Unfortunately too much of the day to day work was dictated by corporate rules, which did not line up with the local marketplace."
bad,Management is too worried about selling that they do not respect employees.
bad,"Inconsistent leadership at a management level, thus, morale suffers."
bad,The company pays well but the social atmosphere is too much like that of a classroom
bad,Assisted customers on flooring projects. Closed sales after measuring service inspected. Restock merchandise as needed. 
bad,its a good company to work for.. the money is good and the staff is questionable
bad,A typical day at work is working on a aisle for a long period of time. Nice co-workers. The hardest part was being to work at 4am.
bad,"Reception, returns, information. Repetitive. Lots of multi-tasking required. "
bad,not fun.  dead end job.  lack of promotional opportunity.  great benefits and training programs.
bad,I love working with Lowes but they will not work with my school. People there are great but some need to work on attitudes. I have learnd a lot from lowes. The hardest part of my job was to learn the return desk. I enjoy goin to work. 
bad,If your going to work at Lowes as a temp DONT GO.. There is no training .. They put you in a department  don't train you on any of the products.. And there check out system is nuts  30 steps to get to getting a person checked out..  .. 
bad,Cashier/Customer Service
bad,The supervisors were rude. They did not care much about breaks or anything like that.
bad,over all the job was a good job and friendly work environment to be in.
bad,Much much hard work loading the trucks. must be in shape for this job. lots and lots of walking
bad,The typical day would be you would go in clock in and then go to your part of the store. Then help out customer's all day until you go home. I learned a lot more about the world and what their coming up with. The management was pretty good they all were nice and cool with everyone. My co-workers were pretty cool they all would help out the new people. The hardest part would be when people asked you questions you don't know and you have to find someone to ask. The best part would be when i got to talk about tractors and yard stuff.
bad,hard work doesnt pay off at store manager has favorites learn nothing kinda just throw you out there to learn on your own co workers are lazy and dont do nothing
bad,"Fast paced, something new everyday. Must be able to work with all types of people."
bad,Lowes had it's good and bad about it. The pay was good but the hours were crazy and it seemed like no one was important
bad,This was a great workplace helped me learn great customer service skills. Hard to advance to managment position but they are great fexible hours around school schedules.
bad,this place was terrible. All the bosses would tell you different things to do. It was a very confusing thing
bad,Lowe's is a great opportunity for those seeking full or part time employment while pursuing other goals. Opportunity for advancement has declined due to restructuring and the decrease of sales over the last few years. Lowe's is an environment in which employees can challenge their selling and relationship skills.
bad,"Had a good crew to work with, managers should be shamed for not working hard. Had potential but wasn't the direction I wanted to go in."
bad,"Lowes is a great place to work, especially for college students who wish to gain some knowledge of the construction industry. Lowes also offers several opprotunities for advancement."
bad,"Fun to work here when things are fair. Schedule is made 3 weeks in advance, part time will be worked the minimum of 10-12 hours a week."
bad,"I enjoyed the work and fellow employees including  management. Management is limited by Lowes corporate offices, which contracts out janitorial and assembly services. Human resource services taken over by computer program that lacks personal interaction. Pay raises are determined by the corporate office without any regards to the ability and magnitude of ones work experience while working there."
bad,"I‚Äôve worked at Lowes for 3 years and I‚Äôve slowly made my way up to management (started at $10.50, now at $13.80 as a part time head cashier. I believe full time is $15). The pay is good, and so are the benefits. However, and my store management is a joke. They have their favorites and it‚Äôs very obvious. Lowes is VERY picky about schedules. They rarely give set schedules, and they overwork their regula Bc they dont want to keep seasonal people. Corporate is a joke and will notback you up on anything. Very frustrating job."
bad,"Lowes was an interesting work experience you can say, they helped me a lot with my schooling being they help pay for some of It, the professionalism needed a bit more effort"
bad,I was given a description of the job and found after starting that it was not as described. They dissolved their Human resources department and made it completely computerized. Achievement is rewarded with small trinkets and tokens as opposed to professional reward such as raises or bonuses.
bad,I loved working there the people are great. However management is very poor and show a lot of favoritism for certain people. A lot of shadyness and poor management styles.
bad,CEO's changed the company where alot people had to leave. Doing away with Department Managers where we had to find other work. The company in whole has gone downhill
bad,"The whole management team is a joke and unorganized chaos they make the hard workers work while others stand around on their phones, Facebook, snapchat and other stuff all rules apply to only some and their open door policy is a joke"
bad,The FSA position is by far the worst job available at Lowe's.  You start every morning by thoroughly cleaning both male and female bathrooms for nearly 2 hours.  The rest of the day is spent cleaning absolutely everything.  It is boring and made me feel like I wasn't worth anything or really contributing to Lowe's.  Very rarely did I get to repair anything or perform other maintenance activities.  It is 8+ hours of cleaning nonstop every day and I wasn't paid nearly enough for that.  Nor did I feel as if my work was appreciated by anyone and I was looked down upon my many employees because I was a glorified janitor.
bad,I was promised 12 dollars when I was coming from a frontend loader to a lumber associate but they never gave it to me. Asked thum when I am going to get my raise I was promised but the HR said she couldn't do anything because of me not having any other job experience.
bad,After a major company rebuilding Lowe's chose to terminate higher paying positions. Very dedicated associates have been released due to filling with lower salary positions.
bad,i would start off my day working a 6am-3pm shift on some days. While there I would make my schedule for my cashiers. I would put out the drawers each morning.
bad,Lowe's was a great place to learn and advance. The only thing I did not care for there was management. It was a company you can advance in as well.
bad,"the job i had working at lowes was pretty good, until after the season after that my hours were cut down really bad. if i didn't have my hours cut so bad id still be working there. my co-works were very helpful and fun to work with so were some of my managers, the hardest part of the job was not to go ""outside of my job placement"" meaing i was in trouble for doing thing that were not my job but i worked my hardest never the less."
bad,great work enviorment.I have learned a lot.great rewards.Family friendly at times.great bonus when goals are reached.
bad,"Open and closed the warehouse"
bad,Dealing with customers who were sometimes unappreciative! Learned lots of patients. Standing on my feet was the hardest part of the job.
bad,"From 11 am to about 7 pm the work flow can be either steady or fast paste."
bad,"everyday at lowes is different always something new."
bad,"Usually extremely short staffed, reprimanded when unable to complete all tasks. ""Impact"" hours, does NOT benefit the customer, nor the employee. It just takes bodies to the register leaving their departments abandoned without coverage. Having neighboring departments cover not only their own departments but their departments next door. Which encounters BAD customer service when no one is there to take care of the customer."
bad,"The environment is not so bad ,and the employees always kept me going. When it comes to management and how they hsndle people hours is awful. So i wouldn't really recommend it."
bad,"A typical day at work will be coming in making sure all my people are here. Checking my emails to see if theres any new news or task for today. we would have a short meeting on what we are doing today/ how big is the truck to unload and put away, and safety. After our meeting we would all walk together to the back and start work. The one thing you will never see coming though is you are in charge of the whole store. Store manger expects the whole store to be down stocked, cleaned, all list done, and many many more."
bad,"Hours worked with my personal life, but was tiring and started to feel wear on body for the excessive walking and standing. Customers became positive and was at times enjoyable to see and assist with lifting and helping them with products. I took pride in cleaning and organizing my area daily."
bad,"My experience was good but there were times where I had not been able to take a break, resulting in increased fatigue throughout my shift. I would recommend this as a first job."
bad,"In my opinion Lowe‚Äôs is not a forever career. Due to the poor communication, stressful and fast paced environment, and poor management, it is not an ideal place to work."
bad,A good place to work at people are good people everybody get alone people love people help each other out when people need help I thank god for that job
bad,"Walking alot non stop expect break"
bad,Everyone's nice makes sure you are ok or if you need help. Everyone ends up helping each other out in the long run. Makes sure store is looking good and stocked.
bad,I like the people that I work with.  There are very few full time positions available and I need to work full-time.  It is a good place to work if you only need a part-time job.
bad,"Lowe's was a great company with a great focus on their customers. We were invested in making their home improvement projects successful and given the tools to do so. Then, the company decided it wanted to be amazon and began promoting a culture of increased emphasis on customer service while gutting the employees' abilities to carry out that service. It became a game of pouring enormous sums of company monies down black holes like the yearly Vegas blowout for corporate and computer systems that all but collapsed entirely, a game no longer worth being a part of."
bad,"Lowe's is friendly and pays alright for what it is. But its doors open at the crack of dawn, and employees don't go home until 10-11 each night. This is absurd for a hardware store."
bad,my review is I am a good person to work with and I am a hard worker and a team player and get alone well with co worker and I like meeting new people and the people is good to work with and the managers is good for the company
bad,"This is a great place to work for people needing to find a place to work. However there are limited opportunities to advance within this location. The management is also somewhat lacking and tend to throw employees under the bus if they do not like them. Also the HR manager sometimes withholds certain employees' resumes who are trying to transfer to another store, many have had to quit and reapply at the other location to be considered for the job."
bad,"Do not accept this position without a lot of help (at work and home), especially at high volume stores."
bad,"cutting keys and helping with hardware questions, learned how to become a certified locksmith,management was cutthroat, the culture of employees was great,hardest part was cutting chipped keys, the fellow employees were the best part of the job always got along with everyone"
bad,"Work Day can be hectic dealing with your own departments, issues throughout the store, Customer complaints. A whole lot of running around. I learned Merchandising, maintaining profitability,  promoting teamwork, leadership. Large group of managers some good some bad overall ineffective as a group lack communication and initiative to change. Workplace culture is lax and morale fluctuates, associates frequently working by themselves with multiple tasks and departments to cover. However strong camaraderie exists between associates. Hardest part of the job is introducing new ideas and creativity into the job. Best part of the job is taking care of your associates and seeing their appreciation and emotion."
bad,"The work was difficult, and you had to beg for your raises. I wouldn't recommend the night shift or unloader positions to anyone. If you are truly looking for a job with Lowe's apply for a CSA position."
bad,"The madisonville lowes was ok!!! learned lots, of things.   Like cashier to peoples charg accounts.   You had to know alot to work there.  Hundreds of People charge accounts."
bad,The management doesn't do everything they can for you. They will try to get the most work from you without giving you full details of what you will be doing.
bad,"Over all it turned out to be just a job not a career . Which was disappointing . Management was very bad not very professional at "
bad,the management was great  there. I have to say the hours are crazy there. let just say if you work night shift one day. The next day your working morning shift.
bad,"They don't care if your a single parent and can't work their hours, they want what they want . If not your replaceable.  Everyone's friendly and helpful . Minus some managers."
bad,If you're willing to work your butt off pouring sweat then you can work in shipping. It's not a hard job to learn but it is VERY physical.......
bad,It was a ok place to work. Everyday was challenging. You never knew what to expect from day to day. One of the hardest part of the jobs was to complete large task with very very short staff.
bad,the mangent and hr wherent good keeping track of medical problems for workers
bad,Working at Lowe's I talk to and met people from all over the world. Lowe's is a great customer service oriented company.
bad,"Productive "
bad,"Lowe‚Äôs was a fun experience but Lowe‚Äôs was also sneaky, unfair, and liars. Lowe‚Äôs will not work around your college schedule if you are attending college. They want everything to go their way and just won‚Äôt work with anyone."
bad,"Lowes just does not care how hard you work for them , they do not tell you that its a good place to advance in your career but it is not. whenever making a request , you are ALWAyS told I don't know or ill try , when deep down you know no one cares enough to really try. they make money and reach comp but will still excessively cut hours for par timers. I believe Lowes has changed for the worse it use to be better. Building Materials / lumber should get paid more for the hard work and labor that is done but they don't care , if you are going to work at Lowes I highly suggest you refrain from being a part time lumber associate unless you want to get slaved with labor and underpaid for it."
bad,"Within Lowes I knew what to expect in regards to you had your password reset requests and emergency ID requests on a normal daily basis but with Statesidebpo you never know what the troubleshooting will be - from pin resets/alarm panel issues/sensor issues/mobile app creation/resets, etc."
bad,"Due to company restructure.  No job security due to bog box store.  Will never work for fortune 500 company again.  I missed out on lots of birthdays with family, and have regrets for that.  Scheduling is only one weekend off a month for full-time"
bad,"Lowe's was a wonderful place to work...5 years ago.  They let go most of their VPs and directors then replaced them with people out of touch with their employees and reality.  Lowe's has taken the stance of laying off and or running off their talent then replacing them at 4/5 to 1 in Bangalore India.  There is no job security at this company any longer.  They do have good benefits, pay well, and have a beautiful corporate campus."
bad,My typical day is coming in at 6pm and logging on to my computer and clocking in. Getting a 15min break 8:30-8:45. I learned a lot of patience and how to stay calm in a heated situation and always please the customer. My manager always stayed in touch with me and my personal life when I had issues. Everyone was very friendly and just there to do their job and go home. The hardest part was trying to help a customer that didn't want to be helped. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people and hear about their great experience with Lowes.
bad,"At first I loved working for Lowes. Then Management changed, Nepotism crept in.  Deception in processes changed. I eventually moved to a different department.  My excitement has changed and am deeply disturbed at deception and lies that have been told."
bad,"Worked very hard, but I  felt I did not make enough money for all the hard work. I loved my schedule, but I worked too hard. I loved going to work, but I need more money."
bad,lowes is great place to start out in the job world. Ive enjoyed my time over the past 2 year but am ready to move on. Im looking for a full-time office job with good pay.
bad,A great place to work because if you work there you only would 3 days if you work weekend and 4 days if you work the weekdays. pay and advancement is a plus if your work here.
bad,"Overall a decent environment to work in, but even with experience the pay wasn‚Äôt enough to make it with a family. "
bad,"I don't live in a big city so a good job with good benefits that is Monday-Friday, that's a miracle really. I love my job & the crew that I work with are amazing people. I just wish that we weren't expected to be such corporate robots. Retail isn't for everyone, in fact it's a lot more difficult then you think. There are people out there, I think, that forget that the people behind those counters at the department/grocery stores are human too. I feel that Lowe's is also forgetting this fact."
bad,Hardest part of the job is being so under staff and never having enough coverage. Lowes would be a great place to work if they would consider having the proper coverage to run the company.
bad,Working at Lowe's is satisfactory. Pay is great depending on your job tire. The downfall is that there is no room to grow in the company. Employees get maxed out once you reach a certain pay rate.
bad,Fun work experience with supportive management. It is easy to grow with thin the company and enjoyed helping customers.  My co-workers were supportive.
bad,Mon thur Friday 7am to ??? working with the other team members was the best part. Hardest part of the job not knowing what you will be doing that day.
good,"Starting early in the morning hr to prepare breakfast and lunch for the corporate office. Preparation is a very big thing that is associated with the temperature dialogue and the process of meetings such as what‚Äôs planed for the day. "
good,"Typically I would wait on customers and mix the paint color of their choice. Sometimes I would expand my knowledge about paint to the customer to help them decide what was best for them. I learned all about the different brands of paint and I also learned how to run a cash register. Management was extremely poor depending on what manager you went to. The work place culture was very stressful. It was almost like people picked aides.The hardest part of the job was knowing if you were one of the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù or not.The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing how to make paint, and expressing my artisit manner onto others when they were stumped on colors."
good,at my lowes the management did really shady things which is why i got fired in the first place they hid a write up played with my attendance and they also write you up for nothing really the pay was decent but they wouldn't give vacation time i had to complain about it so i can even get the 2 days i requested off i hardly took lunches even if i worked 5 or more hours
good,"Working at Lowes taught me patience. Management was awful, the employees got to slack off, and the customers were rude. They worked me too hard for my pay grade. I would mix paint and handle other stations that were not my own. I was being pulled in 13 different directions and if I couldn't handle it I would get reprimanded."
good,Great people at my store was salary so I put in a lot of hours trying to make sure everything was complete. Too much work for one person to handle all of the stress
good,"This job was very attractive like most jobs are. However, there are so many cons. In the Q&A there is a portion about if Lowes has benefits. It does, but out of the expense of the worker. All benefits get deducted per pay check and the worker is left with whatever is left if anything is left after deductions. In a sense, benefits aren't provided. Another portion is about overtime. The only workers in Lowes who are allowed to obtain overtime without a write-up or any other disciplinary action are the drivers and driver helpers. Everyone else is subject for discipline if overtime is reached and most of the sale associates get their hours cut. Management is all over the place and seriously need to work on their communication. Hardest part of the job is really when we have to do other peoples jobs on top of our own. Our job is pretty decent by itself, but us in receiving are always pulled to ""assist"" aka do someone else job. Lowes does not pay for added trainings and licensings. Workplace culture is decent, except every area has one person that doesn't work hard. We've mentioned it to managers on a frequent basis, but nothing changes. Basically, you work hard while someone else who is doing the same job as you is doing nothing and gets paid more. We barely ever have a full team and turnover rate is insane. Enjoyable part of the job is working and making the best of the job. Most of us have a good sense of humor and rely on that while we work to have a good day. As a heads up, KNOW ON CARES ABOUT YOU! There's a lot of talk about how Lowes wants to treat their workers right and within"
good,management is a joke. the customer is always right and no matter what you have to accept what the manager says and they will throw you under the bus to cover there but. if you are a hard worker you will be used and never appreciate
good,The pay is not great it doesn't cover the cost of living.  Managers leadership is about micromanagement and you have no option.  I would not recommend working at Lowe's if you look to advance it's all about who in the good ole boys club.
good,The store I was in the managers had no say. The employees ran the show. They wanted you to talk to people like they were children. Store manager did not have his managers back. No accountability for non performers
good,"Work on small teams workload too much for the amount of workers. Management didn't help"
good,"always short handed worked overnights was told I would only be in may be one or two departments, when in reality I would work 5 to 6 different departments every night. lazy people who claim they are hard workers night crew does everything while day crew stands around and talk about absolutely nothing"
good,accusation of employee theft run wild with lowes. run the crapout of employees. started me out at lower pay then what was said @ interview. now clean or disposable cups so you can't drink cold water from employee fridge. never clean water fonteens
good,"I loved my job at Lowes, until the management shifted.  the newer manager was vindictive and treated other women unfairly.  "
good,"The most enjoyable part of that job was the people, I really felt like family there, they confided in me and I in them. You learn about the associates and their family."
good,It's not a great job they only hire seasonal people then on top of that they don't give you a notice at all so you could be in the process of looking for another iob
good,if you weren't in the crowd of the popular people they found a way to get rid of you. They managed to have me leave so that my manager would be also eliminated of her position. (she is now deceased)
good,"I started working at lowes two years ago in NC, i loved working there. they were great employers. But when I moved to SC, I took a pay cut and was treated like I did not matter to the company. It feels awful to feel like your employer does not care if you were there or not, especially if you are a good employee."
good,"See other Lowes rating, I don't know why indeed decided to do it twice. Not the greatest company to work for. Don't look into this company as a career. Great pay for students and part time people, or for someone using Lowes as a short stop on their way to their dream career."
good,"Lowe's overall working experience needs a bit improving, when it comes to it's employee's. There need to be better pay increases and better communication amongst managers and staff."
good,I enjoyed going to work every day and the job responsibilities
good,Lazy staff with know management to keep them in line do to company cut backs. You can pretty much show up to work and do nothing and still keep your job. Which was frustrating to us that did do our work. I did meet alot of good people and managers
good,If you like to work this is the place. Compensation may not be what you expect. management will work 12+ hour days.
good,"Typical place to start a part-time job, no where to create a long term or even short term job experience."
good,"Over work and under paid. Not enough employees, favoritism, cliques, incompetent managers. No organization, poor training, extremely low staff. Low moral."
good,excellent place to work to gain experience and as a temporary job but their really is no job stability or security. Once your seasonal work is done then so are you.
good,"You worked when scheduled, you were on your feet for the whole shift, and management was much more interested in sales than employees.  I learned to ask more questions and take more into consideration before accepting a job."
good,This is a fast paced work place.  Once hired if you want a different shift or area you must apply again and go through another interview.  You should be allowed to transfer shifts.
good,"Entirely too much work, terrible work/life balance, expected to work until the overbooked deliveries were done. No repercussions to associates that overbooked the trucks, managers rubberstamped the overbookings."
good,"overall, management is poor but the amount of diversity and different personalities is always a plus. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule"
good,Good company. Has bad down falls in taking care of their employees. They'll give away half the store. (Management) Then blame associates for loss. Great benefits. Made a lot of life long friends. Just overall not great for advancement.
good,"The managers at this store location never listened to their employees about anything regarding the customers ideas, hours/time off, and general work environment sucked."
good,"Management was terrible. the people made it worth working there. The customers were amazing in Mckinney, Tx. I'd go back but they dont offer much at all...barely above minimum wage and I cant live off that."
good,"Retail is always a challenge.  Lowe's does not promote unless you are in the ""club"".  Work life balance is a struggle.  Not a desirable place to work when there are other options."
good,"Management does not think for themselves and unfortunately encourages employees to do the same. It could be a fantastic company, but it chooses not to be."
good,Worked as an Unloader for lowes. Shift included lifting up to 80lbs by yourself and up to 300lbs for two people. Obtained Forklift Order Picker and High Reach truck licenses and received no extra bonus. Small raises yearly.
good,"They did not care about their personnel, had things on paper and then lost them for convenience, and did not work with school schedules. The only good part was the other coworkers throughout the store. Anyone who was a higher-up didn't care."
good,My typical day started by wearing my red vest and clocking in. Then turning my register light on and logining in to the computer. After that checking customers out.
good,"The job was a very cool place, til my assignment ended. But as I was there I had a good workout, had made a few friends and just a good place to be work in."
good,"Critical,demanding,favoritism,no praise for good job done,lack of leadership and lack of respect, scheduling is not based for a single parent, and under paid."
good,"Management never listened to the floor staff, and they had circles that if you were not a part of you may as well not exist. The pay was nowhere near fair for the kind of work demanded."
good,they often get annoyed when you ask for help. I was thrown into a field and didn't pick up fast enough and was not taught to handle certain situations. And when they arose I had t always call for help. The help got annoyed.
good,"This position is a hybrid sales position, and is based solely on commission. You'll get a small salary and basically that is what you live off of. The management at the store in Coeur D Alene Idaho  is horrible.  The store so understaffed, it is hard to find help,  The only positive of this position is being able to work with the customers and make an impact in their home ."
good,"I was seasonal but they told me multiple times they wanted to hire me permanent, but never did. I felt like they were just talking and wasn't serious, and that tis no way to treat people."
good,I wouldn't tell anyone to work here the management team does not know how to treat people they want you to work all the time not enough home life with this place
good,its a ok place to work but they dont give you 24 hour notice before changing schedule and expect you to adapt. they dont care that you have kids or have a life outside work they are not willing to work with you. they  just arent a very flexable employer
good,"My overall experience with Lowes was great, with the exception of management having special treatment for specific employees. After a year and a half it went down hill and I did not enjoy getting ready to go to work."
good,"it was alright a seasonal job, it was very boring and the people didnt really train you and didnt get paid right. was part time but worled almost 39 hours a week"
good,A terrible work experience from the beginning of my time working until the end I tried to last as long as possible. I do my best and am a great employee however the management is terrible and it is very biased.
good,They have gotten to a point that they care more about their shareholders than the views of the employees and their families. The CEO needs to take a lesson from some of the other CEO's that have taken a pay cut to give back to their employees.
good,I did cashier and helped customer with account information. I also did management for the front end which required me to keep an eye on all the cashier.
good,I learned to Focus 100% on a customers needs and to help associates when needed.
good,very long hours on your feet in one spot. Management wasn't always willing or available to help. My co-workers were great people to have worked with. The hardest part of the job wa being stuck in one spot for 8 plus hours.
good,If u want sundays off for church forget about it...u will work all departments.... not enough hours. Pay is decent. Benefits suck.............................................
good,I was a temp at Lowe's and every employee there was the same they all said the same thing to me but they actually worked as a team and handled what would needed to be handled
good,Used to care about employees and worked for encouraging and praising all. Got harder to achieve bonuses and schedules became less family oriented. Made it hard to get the jobs done and help customers too.
good,"Lack of training. Under payed can't understand how a single person can servive on those wages. Got to have a second income or sell drugs to survive. Their training was perty much sink or swim, but everyone else got a mentor to show them the ropes. I don't want to call it discrimination but i will call it racism."
good,"I was able to work in multiple departments and assist customers for a little over about a year. I was consistently working hard and focused on teamwork, taking care of customers and completing task assigned to me by management team. There were some company wide changes in pay, benefits and opportunities that are company wide, however these pay benefits and opporuntities company wide change were not distributed to  large portion of the employees. Since this employment, I have taken personal time to reflect on my areas of improvement, and the many areas that I was strong in. My best option was to take an extended personal time to focus improvements of myself and continue my employment somewhere else in the near future(New Employment Search starting January 29th)."
good,"I was a Factory Route Manager for the Lowe's Millwork Shops of Thomasville, Janesville, and Tennessee Millwork shops. I managed a market of 14 Lowe's stores through out Virginia and North Carolina. My employer was a retail service provider, Sales Edge and we were contracted by Lowe's to fill said position."
good,Cannot Advance not given a chance they chose to hire from outside of the workplace. Never giving loyal employees a chance to advance within. Unprofessional
good,Too may petty and jealous people.  The work place felt like high school little groups and clicks.  Some employees would steal your water and food out of the refrigerator.
good,Management has favorites ... Will not accommodate you. They charge your schedule without asking. Lack of communication. Time off request are not easy.
good,I started as seasonal and then was moved to part time and then full time and not once was I told.  When I found out and asked about benefits and pay raise I was told that at this time it wasn't available to me and there would more than likely never be  a chance for increase in pay.  I found another job that I went into knowing was temporary but paid more and allowed me the chance to try to become full time.
good,The mangers are poor they don‚Äôt care about the employees and they put their work load on others.. and when you ask for time off they don‚Äôt give it too you
good,They do not have good communication at this company. I was fired because of a communication error on the GM‚Äôs behalf. I was sick with the flu with a temperature of 120 degrees and i called out sick and they said that i quit.
good,"They use you up until you can‚Äôt be used and more, also make promises to help you get promoted and it only helps if you are one of their favorites. The company is a ok I guess, it is just some of the people that they have set to help run the place. The Supervisors have no empathy, they never tell you what u have done right it‚Äôs always about what was done wrong."
good,"Place orders to restock merchandise and handle receiving of all products"
good,Lowes was great you get great hours for being Seasonal Full time Temporary. 30 to 40 hours. They don't give you warnings of being late just be on time and it won't count again the employees. Do your best to give coverage to others if they need more customer services.
good,lowes was great in the beginning but then things kinda went down hill .after i switch from cashier to pro service . they did not give me a raise for switching to a higher position
good,"Management tells you exactly what you want to hear to make you stay. "
good,Required to master outdated software systems (4) that did not communicate with each other. Required to do the same job as a Professional Sales Associate without compensation while doing the  job I was originally hired to do without assistance from the PSA team.      Once under the watchful eye of the manager was singled out for the slightest infraction while others employees went unnoticed and unchallenged. Not a pleasant place to work.
good,"I plan on leaving this company, the location I'm at has a locality pay $13.57. The state minimum wage is $11.00, trying to advance is not conceivable. The company stated that they will give a one time pay increase of 10% of gross income. For me its only $300.00, granted its only free money but its a one time pay increase. They planned on doing pay increased everything 6 months of .15-.30. So your going to get .30-.60 a year. For those who don't know this is below the cost of living that increases everything year. If the company truly cared for its employees they would do away with pay gaps. Oh by the way if you do the math you would make more money on their pay increase compared to their one time pay increase."
good,"Much signage and verbiage given to customer service, but I saw managers hide from customers all the time.  Turnover was high and morale was really low."
good,"I had fun working with my co-workers. Management is poor. The store hasn't been open a year and has lost most of their staff, due to pay and hours. I was held to part time. Every opportunity for advancement was denied. I finally got the opportunity to transfer and the asm wrote me up the day after I got hired, causing me to lose my transfer. We work inconsistent hours, the management is not understanding. Shift times are not always adhered to, your schedule will be changed without notice. The best part of the job is customers and co-workers."
good,If you wanna be overworked way past the $10.26 an hour then this is your job. No chance for a raise. No chance of working just part time if in school. Will work you 30-35 hrs during school instead of 20 you could of requested
good,"I assisted the Project Specialist in all aspects of his job. I followed up on sales calls, assured product was ordered and received, and was the liaison between my customers and the contractors.  I did all of the order management for everything the PSE sold. I set up all of the deliveries of materials needed to the customer jobsite so that they would be there before the contractors arrived to install the products.I set appointments up for the Project Specialist to meet with the customers for the initial sales call."
good,"As a cashier your biggest job was to take care of customers in a fast and friendly manner"
good,They did not follow their own policies of giving a weekend off once a month this policy was never followed with me and when brought to the attention of management was reprimanded for it
good,Do not wish to write a review at this time would like move past this part of the application process and start applying to other jobs that fulfill my needs
good,Was a great place to work if you like the lack of accountability and professionalism. Some days support from the management team are great. Other days not so much. Same with staffing. The slow days we have to many people working then on the weekends when we were busy there were not enough. As it is with all employers there are pros and cons. Lowes has been great to me personally through the years.
good,"I was a cashier and customer service associate for 2 1/2 years, and an FSA for 1/2 a year. The switch was promised to have a pay raise, it didn't offer it though it was triple the work and stress."
good,"As I left the company they were restructuring each store's management team. Department managers were let go or had to accept a step down, ASM's where cut back and it was more difficult to talk to management team."
good,"Store management is awful. Too much work, not enough pay. "
good,Lowes was a good company to work for back when I started in 1995 but as time went by the Company began to change its focus it was more about making money than looking after its employees so after I was there 17 years I was laid off for no apparent reason and no reason was given
good,"always busy, but great team members make the job fun. The pay is decent, The only down side is you are constantly getting new managers since they keep letting people go."
good,"I have been with Lowe's for almost 10 years. I have been through many layoffs and have seen this company go down the drain. Lowe's does not care about its employees, nor seeing them advance their careers. There are almost no advancement opportunities' now that Lowe's has decided to cut so many of their management positions. If you know someone higher up in the chain of command, you may go far. If you don't, you won't. Lowe's has the 'Good 'ole Boy' mentality when it comes to hiring and promoting, meaning that, it's not what you know, it is who you know.  "
good,"Good for the pay but other than that it is a poor place to work. Although, it can be pretty relaxed at times, the management and those who hold higher positions do not fulfill their roles and are very unprofessional."
good,"The mangement In Lowe‚Äôs is very unorganized, no communication and lack of care for employees but the benefits are great for people with no kids or older people that Just need a little part time job"
good,"Lowes as a company has made many changes that has made performing job as a sales specialists very difficult. Staffing is always at a minimal, leaving associates to cover department and floor hours by themselves."
good,"Used to love working at Lowe's, management is a big issue there. The people are very cut throat and they have no respect for their employees. There is no work/family life. The pay is t that great."
good,A typical day starts around 6 a.m. and the work moral was extremely poor. The days dragged on. I found my delight in assisting consumers by providing the best service possible.
good,"Fast, high paced environment.  Not enough associates to be on top of customer service. No training,  although  it is available,  not enough time for you to complete."
good,"I cannot recommend working for Lowes because of the horribly low compensation and their ""revolving door"" policy for associates and management.  In my area, McDonalds pays Dollars more starting, than Lowes does. I will have been there for 5 years soon, and I just barely made it over the $12 an hour mark..."
good,I was a temporary employee and no one knew what they were doing. They were so concerned with safety they not take the time to train their employees in the department they were working in.
good,"Not invested in their people, worried more about personal drama, no career progression plans, no/low pay increases, cuts employees hours instead of pushing sales. main sales people reach 40 hours before peak sales days so only temporary or few employees available for peak sales days.  Pay week starts on Monday, and most full time regular employees are getting cut by Friday and peak sales is Friday-Sunday. Makes no sense."
good,"It seems that Management liked to pick favorites associates, would not listen to concerns from new associates about older, more seasoned associates, and most don't seem to know about certain aspects of the store. For example, a service/assistant manager not knowing about the departments that they govern, especially with departments that involved special ordering. We very rarely ever had enough people working the floor in any department, and if we happened to have an abundance in one department, another department suffered with no help at all. Calling a code 3 to a department ""Any manager/MOD/available associate"" when you are the only one in your department means absolutely nothing to anyone in the store, especially not managers. You can call about six or seven times before someone shows up, especially if you are in a department that most of the managers don't understand, IE: Millwork, Plumbing, Lumber, Flooring. The hours that I worked were great, but the overall morale for the entire store from the time I started to the time I left had hit rock bottom."
good,"Such a wonderful staff with a real willingness to help customers but was really lacking in the managements willingness to help their employees. "
good,"Lowe's fell the way of Best Buy, too many managers and too much micromanagement. Not much more to say, I worked there for 7 months and at the end I had no desire to work there anymore. I will still shop there"
good,Management has no idea most of the time what is going on...they focus mostly on sales numbers...younger generation put first in job upgrades....pay for what is expected is low...
good,"I use to enjoy my work selling to contractors and meeting their needs.  However, recently the management change has caused a lot of discontent with the employees.  As well as unnecessary product shortage in filling contractor orders"
good,"Overall Lowe‚Äôs is a good employer who cares about employees. Even if salary is minimum, benefits are amazing so that makes it worth it. Not bad for a starter job"
good,Managers don't care about you. All they want are bonuses and you to show up even if you're on your death bed so to speak. Managers contradict each other too. Which causes employees to walk out. Lowe's is a popularity contest as well.
good,"f your time as a personal banker, engaging customers in sales conversations in order to identify appropriate financial solutions. This position, within PNC‚Äôs Retail"
good,There was very little to no work life balance for this job nor the pay commensurate to the time you would put in. The only job I felt that I was an after thought. I had no input and was expected to be a robot.
good,I just worked there for the summer but they have a high turnover rate and they do not want to pay benfits so after a while they start firing people they don't want to give raises to.
good,"I worked in the paint department in the store and was responsible for serving customers and mixing paint. We also had to stock the shelves with merchandise while the store was open. I had no problem with the job functions, but at the time, I was attending college to get a degree in video production. They did work with my school schedule at first, but then would not after the second semester. I had to leave the company and find a job that would work around the school schedule. I thought it was terrible that Lowe's would not like to see someone get a degree and make their life better. I guess they just wanted me to stay there as a part timer the rest of my life."
good,Usually consisting of juggling multiple customers and departments all while trying to pull delivery orders and work up quotes for install jobs.  Attentive to detail and frequent use of math for problem solving.
good,Stressful job with no motivation or moral from manager. Understaffed which leads to low moral in employees and frustration amoung staff. Flexible hours.
good,Great place to start in the workforce. Get what you need and move on. The management doesn't really respect their employees. The pay is not great. Try somewhere else.
good,"I can certainly say, that this company is not what I thought it would be. The culture of training/development, management staff, and other processes are not where they need to be at all. Because I have worked here in frustration, the frustration has moved me forward in deciding what to do with my education. Rethink Lowe's, safe yourself the hassle."
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement is highly stressful to work for. Lowe's loves to save money at the employee's expense. This is apparent when you are understaffed constantly so that they can save money on labor hours while leaving you by yourself for most if not your whole shift. Most of the equipment in the store is rundown, such as the forklifts and the aisle blockers. The compensation is not bad for some positions but the company tends to give you a lateral transfer rather than a promotion when you apply for new jobs within the company. What that means is you end up working a harder job for the same amount of money. Because of this a lot of the staff ends up quitting and you get left with training new people. The kicker is when you find out some of the people you are training make more than you. Finally Lowe's management tries to push Part time workers  into having open availability. If you do change your schedule they often times try and punish you by giving you really bad shifts such as all closing shifts."
good,It is a decent place to work except that management does not take into account the knowledge someone has when it comes down to advancement. They follow word of mouth and gossip more than what the person knows about the product and their work ethic.
good,"The store I was in had very little in the way of employee morale. The Store manager was either a football coach wanabe or thought he was a fire and brimstone preacher. "
good,"Company policy is to card everyone purchasing tobacco and/or alcohol products regardless if they look old enough or not. If you can handle tourists complaining and treating you like garbage all day, not having a set schedule, constant backstabbing, never ending drama, corporate pulling the manager out of the store to do stuff at other stores, no advancement if you are female then this is the job for you.  Angel Fire, NM., is nice to visit but don't move there. The town revolves around and caters to rude tourists who think they are better then everyone else and they are quick to let you know."
good,Great pay but work and life balance was hard. Many different shifts and promotion was highly unlikely. Support from management was not the greatest.
good,"Has gone down hill since new ceo took over. Closed stores, lost our bonuses all while his pay check was increased. Gettng ahead in this company is almost impossible to do."
good,"I work as a seasonal employee in lawn and garden running cash register. You are not told if you will have a job when seasonal comes to an end. You are given a schedule and then they will have you to work lets say 12-9. They will call you at 9am and ask why you are not there because someone changed the schedule on the paper by the door, but did not change the schedule in the computer and then you are counted as late and told to be there within an hour."
good,"The job consisted of front end functions such as cashier, stocking front end products, trash, mopping front end. Co-workers were fun to work with."
good,Was hired for part time seasonal. Job was fun. Was hired to make sure all customers were finding what they were looking for. I was able to walk around the store and assist the customers.
good,"-clock in sign into computer and start helping customer asap customer service desk"
good,"I miss my work with Lowes I think mainly because I was there for such a long time (13 yrs) and i knew my job very well..As an Appliance Sales Specialist, I was very knowledgeable and knew the program very well and wrote over $1 million in sales year after year..In 2012 they stopped their commission and spiff program and I took an enormous pay cut..I know I would still be there today in the same capacity had it not been for the pay restructure."
good,"job is boring and same everyday.  A great bunch of people but a constant turnover of employees. I was semi retired and was constantly  training people,  covering for people who didn't show up for work."
good,smh. this job used to be the place you wanted to work. lowes has went down the drain. if you arent make you will have a hard time advancing here.
good,The level of professional was lacking in the store for which I worked. Management was not proactive nor supportive.  Some co-workers were given special treatment causing disruption amongst other employees.  Lowes as a corporation is excellent but for the store I worked for very poor.  The benefits package needs improvement.
good,"I like the people love my job great managers but the scheduling leaves more than a lot to be desired, it will never change I have been told it has been this way for years and years. most of the people there have been there for many years and they are still part time."
good,"A typical day at work involved maintaining the paint department, mixing paint, answering customer's questions on wall and window treatments, and placing orders for wall and window treatments. The management was not very understanding. They refused to transfer me to  cashier when I became pregnant, and I was forced to work in the paint department, sometimes by myself, until I went on maternity leave when I was 8 months gestation. I don't believe I would have minded my job so much if the management would have been a little more personable and cared more about the wellness of their employees."
good,I love my customers. I hate the schedule I get. I work with all kinds of people.
good,Not alot of good things there. All they are concerned about is sales and sales only.
good,"If you work in retail, this is probably the best place to work. They practice work safety at the highest level. However, the morale is terrible. Employees are rarely recognized by the work they do."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's. It's an excellent place to gain experience. It is however not an excellent place for a work/life balance and money. The most important thing to realize is that Lowe's is a retail company so you get what you expect.
good,I enjoyed working there. The management is a little unorganized and there are a lot of counterfeit purchases. I personally was given counterfeit money while I was a cashier. I was yelled at by the management for taking it but was then told that I am sup post to and then report it. I was pulled in two different directions with the managers and finally had enough.
good,"If you want rewarded by during the store manager personal favors, this is the job for you. most of the coworkers were great to work with untill they took all sales comission away. They hired in 65 lower paid employees to take place of thier higher paid sales specilist and started firing sales people who had made a career out of lowes."
good,"This job was okay, something that I will definitely recommend to a recent HS grad, who is still undecided about college. It is also good to keep as a second job. Not something I would have love to turned into a career (unless its at cooperate or higher management level) which is why I left, because it was just too much favoritism and not worth my time..."
good,Great pay. No job advancement for doing a great job. Would hiring new employees than promote the older one.
good,"Lowe‚Äôs is a good company to start as a first job for immigrants who seek Canadian work experience. It could be just a survival job, but gives confidence to work in new culture for immigrants. The company gives first preference to customer service than anything else, so working at Lowe‚Äôs gives a good opportunity to learn those Canadian etiquettes."
good,"Managers don't want to hear about any problem. Weather it be a safety issue or problem with your time card. If it doesn't directly affect their ""on the clock time"" they will want you out of the store."
good,It can be a good job but management usually asks you to do to many things and never enough time. Management is pressured to do more with less but when it comes to the workers to do it they do not compensate them. New president is outsourcing jobs where he can and cutting long term employees with forced shift changes that are unneeded. Compensation is not enough for the what your asked to do. They say customer satisfaction comes first but they do not staff the stores to meet that goal. Then getting blamed for the failure of the store when managers don't staff enough.
good,I really enjoyed working in the Garden Center at Lowe's. inside jobs were not as satisfying. Fellow employees were for the most part very nice and enjoyable to work with. When there was a deadline and a large amount of work to get completed there was always people pitching in to help.  The scheduling of hours was never consistent and planing outside of work was difficult. The hardest thing was the large turnover of people. The lack of  benefits and hourly rate made for lots of people coming and going. Managers were friendly and helpful. Cooperate planning and procedures often were not logical or well thought out.
good,Lowes is a fantastic place as a starting job.  The pay is adequate with a varied work life and high activity. Scheduling is flexible depending on management.  Good for part-time employment especially students.
good,I want work for a company that cares about their employees.Lack of training .they are very safety continuous.i feel uncomfortable there most of the time due to doing switching from task to task before learning it completely.
good,Most of the employees were wonderful to work with.  It was management that was the problem.  Most managers were fired and only one is left from the ones that were there when I worked.
good,"A typical day at work should be to come in and assess what needs to be taken care of, with an emphasis on customer support. The warehouse is woefully understaffed, its managers care more about their own bonuses then promoting the store and its employees. Several times, supervisors have been told about issues which have been totally ignored. Many employees are looking for other means of employment because Lowe's has become complacent in just getting by."
good,"In the past it was a good place to work, but constant restructuring of management has made employees and customers miserable. It IS all about the numbers and bottom line, and inexperienced management only cares about themselves, still some of the co-workers are awesome."
good,"Slow paced if it's winter months, fast in summer and spring, most of the days is spent downstocking or front facing, but only as there is not much else to do. The hardest part of the job is the pacing and the lack of direct action from most managers. Managers hold personal bias. Working closely with people your own age is always enjoyable and makes for more bearable days."
good,They expect too much out of you . Over work you like crazy and use you . They can‚Äôt get any new hires to stay they end up quitting within a week because they see all that is expected
good,"Recent changes to company policies have been driving moral in the whole store down for months now. Long shifts, almost no weekends off, and declined your PTO requests."
good,I left because they said I was cap and I had not had a raise in three years and they were hiring people making more money then myself. I like the customers and what I did but I could not move from the cashier portion. I had been with them for 17 years.
good,Be careful when you choose to work for Lowes. Be careful who you trust and what impression you make as it may keep you stuck in your current position.
good,"Good position if you don‚Äôt mind working every weekend, no sick days, no vacation time. There is no consistency to scheduling. Working with a skeleton crew daily!"
good,Due to an DV injury from my partner I was forced to take 3 months sick leave and my casual position did not include return to duties like I was entitled too.
good,"I was a PSI in the Chicago Market.  That position has since been eliminated.  It was a very hard program to navigate and it's a good thing they did away with it... too much gray area, but it was fun while it lasted and it was not the typical ""red vest"" on the floor job.  I had a lot of freedom and loved most of the management I worked with.  I have also worked in the Kitchen Cabinet department in another store.  There is little to no schedule flexibility so it was not a good fit for me but I have several friends who love working for Lowe's."
good,"My experience is that their hiring practices are by default designed to weed out qualified, top performers.  People are not placed in the positions they are most qualified for.  They will not place you in a full time position unless you are seasonal, and part time first.  This process can take more than a year."
good,Lowe's was overs staffed wit managers and not enough sales associates. Managers walked around all day starring and peeping around corners. They did not promote upward mobility fairly if at all. Managers had favorites that they gave the work hrs. too. They also constantly changed your work schedule without consulting with you.
good,"I started at lowe's did everything correctly and by the books, I was never offered a higher position despite interviewing for them several times. The management was an absolute joke"
good,"Managers made things hard to work with, no schedule fixing after hire, paid less then was offered, other employees made it a hostile work environment."
good,"Poor management, very little promotion from within unless friend of managers. No leadership only finger pointing Rumor mill is like junior high. Complete and total disconnect between management and employees"
good,"I learned to use there software, management had bad attitudes that trickled down to employees, workplace culture was not friendly to other employees. Best part of the job was the customers."
good,"After working for Lowe's for over 9 years and all I get is a 2 week severance bonus, that is just not right. Maybe it is a good thing I no longer work for Lowe's."
good,"Favoritism, hard to move up, management is a disaster and they love to keep the store running short staffed... Not paid enough for all that is required from you"
good,"I was hired to be a CDL driver!"
good,"I don‚Äôt know how one person can ruin a store - an entire crew - but she did it. I had to quit Nd I‚Äôm not much of a quitter but most of the staff had already left ahead of me and others are absolutely miserable.  "
good,Typical retail environment with no job security. The store is a relatively clean environment and the company tries to ensure a safe space to work in. The level of frustration can be highly elevated if you are a conscientious person.
good,"It was okay at first and I understand that every place has it‚Äôs ups and downs but it is very overwhelming (only getting worse). I oversee the front end by making sure that everyone is getting their lunch and breaks. I also make sure that money is pulled when needed. I help with the internet orders and at all registers when needed. I ensure that snacks, drinks and batteries are filled."
good,"Lowes will bend its employees over backwards for its customer base and then turn and yell at them for what they did to try and help."
good,"Management is very hard to work with, no consistency, short staff making it very stressful. Took over 3 months to get hired.  Very stressful process to get hired"
good,"run, run as fast as you can! pay and benefits are decent but you will end up medicated like the other 75%!! You have an 8 week rotating schedule- 1030am to 7pm, 9am to 6pm, 7am to 4pm, 2 shifts of 8am to 5pm then start the rotation again.  chaotic, hectic, demanding, and moral is very low. high turnover."
good,There are many changes taking place on a corporate level. I enjoy what I do my coworkers and especially customers. It's really only the schedule that I find difficult at this time.
good,"Long Hours, no respect for Delivery Department.  Delivery Department stands alone, the other departments do not assist Delivery in their efforts to locate and obtain products that customers ordered for delivery.   Paid Fairly, long hours, good benefits atmosphere is not friendly for employees."
good,"Lack of cooperation from peers to help out in other departments...poor management, they don‚Äôt care about employees    So much is wrong that it covers up any things that are right"
good,Lowe‚Äôs has cut a lot of hours and it‚Äôs been difficult for us to get things done in time since it‚Äôs only a few of us. The pay should be better than what it is now.
good,Really had high hopes for my stint with Lowe's and had alot of respect for upper management but for the 2nd time in 2months I was verbally abused in front of my peers. You should NEVER tell a subordinate to stay in their place or raise your voice at them on the sales floor. Surely this is not what Lowe's stands for?
good,Lowes is an ageist company - looking to remove seasoned employees in favor of cheaper younger ones. I had been screwed over numerous times by management and finally with the store reorganization I had to leave - which turned out to be a good Thing!!
good,Store management was not helpful at all. Requesting their assistance was hit or miss. Mostly miss. Not enough staff to cover all departments. Which in turn brought sales down and fewer hours available to bring staff. Customer waiting was a big problem. The other problem was finding staff personal to help as they were giving multiple departments. Some they knew others they did not.
good,"Since our office is being closed in Toronto and relocated, there is no current results for a review to be added at this time. Head Office is now located in Boucherville Quebec."
good,"Lowes didn't offer advancement for certain positions, like once your in a certain positions there was no moving up. Lowes didn't give me enough hours, I couldn't afford anything, and when I asked for more hours they couldn't give them."
good,"lowes wasn‚Äôt a good job for me. lowes didn‚Äôt have a friendly environment. all the managers were super unhelpful, and their head cashiers were all very rude."
good,great for people who need a simple job. Management is all over the place in the winterville area. great for people who do not have any other future plans right now.
good,"Company is good to work for, the benefits that they offered are acceptional. Eventhough its REATIL they for the most part make you feel like family..."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers more than management. I left retail because lowes left a bad taste in my mouth. Trying to keep up with their work schedule was not the most easiest either
good,During the recent couple of months the morale achieved a record low. New expectations on all employees were driven home by threats to their employment.
good,position discontinued throughtout the company.  New management does not seem to have any better sense of day to day operations than previous management did.
good,"Management style appears to be ""Management by Bean Counting"" whilst common sense seems to be lacking.  Corporate Bean Counters contrive a strategy and pass it on as the latest gimmick and the managers must Drink the Kool-Aid."
good,"A decent place to work if you don‚Äôt mind a non existent work-life balance. Our company believes that any retail store can thrive as long as it satisfies its customers in every possible way. As an Assistant Store Manager, you will be responsible for carrying out that goal through positive and effective communication with customers as well as efficient operation of the store. You will provide the Store Manager with the help he or she requires to keep the shop in top running order, from ordering inventory and processing sales to generating cash reports and responding to customer concerns and complaints. We‚Äôre looking for a friendly and ambitious professional who wants to begin or continue a career in retail store management."
good,"Worked for this company for XX years, the things I wintnessed should not have gone on in the work place. No room for growth, opinions or ideas. Glad I quit"
good,Overall the job was fairly straightforward. Management didn't tell us what to do on days we didn't get shipments so we just had to stand around trying to look busy.
good,Very busy. Steady. Management is friendly for the most part. Do not work well with family schedules. Pay is very acceptable and they do give raises.....
good,"Low advancement options, managers are given positions based on popularity. A manager can receive a job in a department they have no experience in, and are never on the same page as anyone else."
good,Lowes is a fast paced high volume store. There is a big demand for customer assistance but not enough people to help the customers. They cut hours when they don't have as many sales as they would like so the employees are the ones that suffer.
good,Lowe's is going downhill due to a lack of culture throughout their leadership at the regional and corporate levels.  As with any company the leadership sets the tone.
good,Long hours and pay that did not meet industry standards as well as make the job tough.  And the fact that the company has eliminated the position I am currently working in has helped to hasten my exit from this evolving company.
good,The change from computer systems was never working . I understand that cost them millions .  They have abandoned that program and reorganized the management. leaving the floor without customers service.
good,"I worked unloading the trucks at Lowe's. I also stocked the shelves at night. The drive was really far every day, and I wouldn't be able to repair the ware on my truck"
good,"While I have met many people at this job, this is not a job for anyone who wants to be involved with family. Especially if you are a single parent. The hours can be stressful when you have kids. they hired me for one shift and made me work others when they got rid of my position."
good,"All of management talks to each other, regardless of rules about it. Retaliation is subtle enough, but HR is friendly with management anyway, so any normal employees can never go to HR about management problems. Will fire you without warning. Used to be decent management and culture, but is terrible right now. Will ignore issues until they get bad, then ask you why they weren‚Äôt addressed. Can not say enough, don‚Äôt work at Kentwood Lowe‚Äôs."
good,Management show little concern for employee growth and development. They are more concerned with the work output of employees and overall look of the store. Employee happiness is last on their list of concerns.
good,"Typical days at a customer service position, very long days of always on the floor helping people. the management was ok. the hardest part was being there for a long time and change of management"
good,"The less you care about your work the better. Just go in do your duties and go home."
good,You can basically get along with everyone there but one manager the customers don‚Äôt like him employees don‚Äôt like him but they keep him overall it‚Äôs a fair place to work if you need a job you‚Äôre just a number there
good,Lowe's is going though some changes and trying to adjust. they cut out all the mgr's who had knowledge and replaced them with new mgr's with  no knowledge so less pay. management is a joke
good,"Lower has a good work environment, however, the management and hours are horrible. There is strong bias among the managers and workers. The hours are inconsistent."
good,Good company. Just had a few people that would stab you in the back to cover their mistakes. Managers overlooked problems with employees and the store manager we had when I left was a  Grade a button head. I liked working at lowes. But  there was way to much favoritism  and  no real chance of moving up.
good,"I'm not going to go into details, but my career here is coming to an end because this current store had ruined Lowes for me as an employee."
good,"its a nice place to work, it had its ups and downs but the management sucked. i started out as a seasonal waterer making 10 dollars an hour. moved up to a loader after 2 months, and without telling me moved me to a csa without giving me a higher pay. they promoted me but didn't if that makes any sense. i worked  there for over a year and a half  without any pay raise and when they did it was only 45 cents. I know i dont sound thankful but they were hiring seasonal waterers like i was without any experience for 11.50 an hour. i dont know if its just the one i worked at that's bad or not but the management just sucked. my advise is if you're applying at lowes, keep all this in mind but give it a chance. it really is a fun place to work."
good,"It was laid back with only 20 hours a week and less, I worked in the paint department. Management was really never there and when they were if you were not friends with them outside of work they did not do much for you."
good,"Very under payed for all the work that you have to do. There is almost no room for career advancement, and no raises. There is no set work hours or area. You may be in a different spot than planned day to day."
good,"They have a high turnover rate due to lack of communication all around lack of training and mostly because everyone is worried about themselves not the customer, company or job."
good,I was a customer service rep although I originally applied as an outside lawn and garden cashier. My experience at Lowes was good and yet bad also. Good Luck if you're applying.
good,Its not a bad place to work if you fit in with the right crowd otherwise you a just there. Manager had to many favorites. Hard work for little pay. ok job
good,Very poor management at the location I was at. It was never properly staffed and it was always hard to find help. It was never properly organized in the internet order area. I would not recommend Lowe's as a place of employment.
good,"For the most part, it's busy throughout the day, but as far as scheduling, it sometimes can be too impossible to work by yourself during certain times throughout the shift. "
good,"It was good when I started there, but lately we are constantly understaffed and still are having hours cut. It makes it incredibly stressful as well as many employees gossiping behind your back and making your life miserable"
good,The management was never on the same page and I never felt like I was needed. They had very concerning employees and were vary loose with there rules.
good,"Terrible management. Managers have no desire to take on new ideas and look past all the important aspects of running a company. Many customers complained that the young hires had no clue on how to do projects that some of the ""old timers"" did. How to build or fix things, etc. New young hires were clueless."
good,"Everything you did was micromanaged."
good,It's a good starter job nothing to great but it helps build a resume if you are willing to put up with the corporate machine it's not a bad job but being a manager is way bad
good,Job change was available if you were willing to move. Hated the split shifts and 65 hour work weeks. Receiving job hours were the best if you could get on that crew.
good,This job was great for the pay however if you are not a favorite pick of the managers they will do what it takes to let you go. Leaving this stressful environment was the best choice i could have made.
good,"Do not work here. Management is a joke. You will absolutely regret it. The pay is fairly poor, not bad but not great. Benefits were pretty good, not gonna lie. Im out."
good,"I currently work as a seasonal overnight stocker for this company. You generally do get 35-39 hours in this position, which is a plus. Pay is low for an overnight associate at 10.44/hr. No room for advancement as there are no department managers, just zone managers and up which is not very great for someone like me who is trying their hardest to work up to a salaried management position. You generally work freight and downstock, sometimes doing side jobs that management asks for on occasion. Very strenuous and not good for anyone with health issues as you are required be on power equipment and every department in the store has HEAVY merchandise. My biggest problem with this job is that you CAN NOT go outside for any reason unless you are working outside, which is rare. You can't even go outside on your breaks or lunch. If you smoke, you don't want to work here at all as this is a no smoking company. All in all I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Poor leadership , never there to help the customer "
good,Micro management makes it very stressful . working the 2-11 shift is hard on  your back and hard if you have a family at times I would work 2 weeks same shift . Your family is in bed when you get home and gone to work and school when you wake up . They do love hard workers . The harder you work the more you will be the one picked to work the job of the person that does nothing . The plus side of this company are benefits and 401k .
good,"The job is very stressful. It takes a special person with out a heart to work in this cut throat job. Not only do you get yelled at and cussed out every 10 minutes from customers you never met, but the management is always listening in to your calls and always critizing how you handled the call."
good,"Lowe‚Äôs is your standard retail big box store.  Managers attempt to encourage enployee buy in but can not effectively create an environment of non expendability for their work force.  Demands are high and you are made to feel like the slightly elevated wage for your unskilled labor should motivate you to work, faster, harder longer with the least amount of manning to share work load as possible.  Management consistently fails to hold slow lazy or non compliant employees accountable and overwork honest and dedicated individuals.  Then punish those hard workers for deficiencies in store condition while non performers are left unmolested and fill positions that could be better utilized by someone interested in an honest days work."
good,Can be fast paced and physical. The people I worked with were a great bunch. The hardest part was some customers could be difficult and become loud and animated to get the results they are looking for.
good,"Working at lowes was an awesome experience, all the employees make you feel like family. the managers and supervisors don't treat everyone equally though."
good,"Most of the time the company was not horrible to work for, but it really depends on your immediate supervisor. You have to decide what you want out of the job and what your attitude is going to be. It will not be ideal, there will be some unfair conditions. If you want it to be a good job though, it can be. It is doubtful you or those around you will have received adequate training for everything that is expected of you."
good,"I love the team I work with, however the Leadership in Lowes is creating an environment of extreme distrust amongst its employees."
good,it was ok working at lowes most of them are friendly they do give alolt of hours with good pay i just did not feel the support when it came to the direction of following my education
good,a pay check settled to work here when moved back to NWA probably a lot better at other stores just not the rogers store would not recommend rogers store
good,Everything was great until management lost focus on keeping staff happy and started to focus on just customers. Became a very hostile work environment.
good,"I had to take a job at Lowes after I was laid off, it was a totally different job then anything I had ever had.  I learned a lot but I also learned that it wasn't for me."
good,I can see why he got fired from Home Depot he has horrible morale and EOS scores way down. He does not know how to be a team player its his way or nothing. Threating your job on weekly basis.
good,"working at Lowe's has taught me a lot. I have grown since I have started working there. I do not require any special treatments being a single mother but they were able to work with getting me a set schedule working between hours 8AM-6PM, only working 5 hours a day right now. I can work more but that is how they have part time cashiers working."
good,"Heath care options were good,  but VERY expensive. .. people get fired or find a reason to get rid of you all the time... bunch of bully kids working there."
good,Your required to take care if your department. But there is terrible staffing not allowing you to do your job efficiently. There is some employers who do absolutely nothing yet your required to do their job. Then when you slack from your department you are the one getting in trouble.
good,Enjoy working with fellow employees. There is never enough help in all departments. Always begging management to hire more employees so our customers will get the service they deserve and want. Employees have to not only work as freight crew but have to cover two or three depts. at a time.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and some of the employees"
good,Stand all day no help no one to help give breaks no management  you come in and no one gives u any idea of what they want you to do for day hours are terrible
good,"Management is really hit and miss, co-workers are good people, customers can be a pain, I think the store in Stillwater could be better run, I've learned that its very hard to lose your job."
good,Lowe's is an enjoyable environment to work around. I love the employees there but the pay for what we endure is terrible. also it makes no sense to hire more people when you're cutting the hours of those who currently work there. They need better communication between management and staff and better organization as a whole.
good,"The Employees at Lowe's are not on the same page. They argue about the same things. They don't give the needed hours to their Employees, but they want the Employees to do so much."
good,Ever changing and mostly not for the better trying to emulate the little guys in a huge market that can not operate in this manner.  If you can handle right hand not knowing what left hand does on a minute to minute basis go for it
good,Lowe's needs to back the hard workers they already have.  This restructure is bad for the company.  It has definitely brought down the morale  in the store. You can see it in all the associates and it is hurting the business
good,"It was a department store so it was very easy, just kind of stood there at the register and took money. got boring after awhile. Management was stuck up"
good,"The management at Lowes was very poor and there was not a long off respect for the workers. I left because I felt like I was being treated poorly, though at the beginning it was not that bad."
good,Schedules are highly variable with little ability to plan week to week. Fellow employees are good natured and helpful but lack of suffieient personel is reflected in turnover.
good,I enjoyed most of the work that I did. However again I'd like to be somewhere that I can still have my family time and church time. looing for better opportunity.
good,The coworkers are okay. But the ASMs are lazy and pushy. They want the night stickers to do pretty much every job in the store including theirs then gets upset when the freight is not fully put up.
good,"A typical day has the store understaffed, before call-offs."
good,asnot someone who loves working in retail it was an alright place of business but as being a cashier not an exciting job that fit me. everyone is nice when working with other employees but of course customers were not always
good,"My experience with Lowe's was an up and down road. Work flexibility was not good always working and not being able to spend time with family. Over time was overrated too much overtime, although the pay was good but too tired to spend it."
good,Is not family orientated toward the employees like they claim to be when you are hired.  I had a child while working for them and they would not allow me to adjust my availability once my daughter was born.  Causing my husband to have to quit his job temporarily to care for our child until we can find better suiting jobs.
good,"I would go in work my department in tool world, hardware became aquatinted with customers and their needs for particular projects. "
good,"Nice place to work. Managers are nice, easy to work with. No problems at all. Ignore the usual corporate stuff, that will never change. Other than that, its a good place to work."
good,"When I first started working for Lowe's it was enjoyable and easy to get through the day. Now, there is no where near enough help and you are lucky to make it through the day with your head screwed on straight."
good,Most of the time they hire you as seasonal and then they don't want to keep you on after the summer months. If you are pregnant they want to say their is other reasons they are letting you go but i know they are letting you go do to being pregnant and not wanting to give you maternity leave and time to go to the Dr's when needed They always say Oh we have plenty of staff and this is the most people we have had working for us but when it comes down to the cashiers they were always under staffed in the summer and we were always stressed and dung  things at a time to cover that lack of help.
good,Hard work and dedication to the job is crucial in achieving current and future goals. Be punctual and keep personal business out of the workplace and follow the rules and policies
good,This is a great job if your still in high school/college. Theyre flexible with hours and give you potential to move up. They also give you the chance to work different departments depending on where your needed but it gives you the chance to broaden your teachings and allows you to learn more.
good,Overall good place to work for college students and older employees. Management isn't around most of the time. There is no advancement in the company anymore. But good place to work.
good,"In terms of compensation/benefits this company is good. The main drawback is the CPO office is a start up and all the bugs are not worked out. I understand all jobs have problems however, this company has a lot of nepotism- people are not qualified for their position which makes it harder on the people that are qualified. Perhaps in a few years the CPO office well be much better."
good,This is a nice job for somebody who wants to use it as a stepping stone to something bigger and better. Very hard to advance here because the advancments are turned into a popularity contest. Also some nice people who work there
good,"Culture is changing for the best? If it wants to compete seriously in the next 20 years, change is urgent. Constant reorg is making progress challenging."
good,Work culture could be greatly improved if management listened to their employees' ideas. Consistency in protocol/policy control is lacking.
good,Plant care consisted of watering and  stocking.  Repeat Customers depend on your assistance in plant selection and knowledge of varies plants  viable in each season.
good,"I get along well with generally everyone so I enjoyed my co-workers and management."
good,a good job for high school/college student even someone who has retired but not for making an actual living and having paying bill or taking care of a child.
good,"Schedule is awful with family.  a lot of politics in management."
good,I liked the work I did here but when you have management straight out of high school who did not even know how to do your job it made for poor moral.
good,"Loved my position and job... Sad part is management is not professional nor quality... very vindictive, retaliation, abusive, non supportive & misrepresents the truth ... they prefer to cut employees hours and cut the customer base short in customer service for the sake of their bonus. "
good,The employees were what made coming to work enjoyable.  The management or lack there of was the only issue I had. I had fun while I worked there and made some lifelong friends.
good,"as a customer service associate I found Lowes not a job for someone who likes to Help people. Lowes demands you give the consumer the run-around regarding issues they have came across while working with the local stores. Lowes has a lot of issues regarding the items they sell and when the consumers are not satisfied they call into the call center. associates then assure the issues will be resolved, but the issues most times are only given a temporary fix. Lowes makes empty promises to their new hires of pay raises and promotions and then they don't hire from within for management position and have the associates train the new hires who re getting the higher pay"
good,"It's a fun workplace, the managers let you work how you want just as long as you're doing your job correctly and taking care of the customers. Nice hourly pay. I learned a lot about selling mowers and how to mix paint and deck stains. Co-workers are usually friendly."
good,On a normal day at Lowes I punch in and walk my area to see how the day has gone. I then meet with my team and ask about the day they have had. Then I go find management to check in on sales. The team that I have is very motivated by my leadership. Right now the hardest part about my job is the waiting for a promotion when  I have exceeded the company goals for the past 4yrs.The most enjoyable part is the time when Christmas time comes around.
good,Lowe's isn't a bad company to work for but the management team at the facility that I work at aren't very professional. I wouldn't recommend this co. to anyone.
good,"The thing that I learned with this job is mainly how to communicate better with people. Co-worker where good people, but the management was not that good, kind of sloppy I would say."
good,"TYPICAL DAY"
good,"his company does not believe in paying you what your worth, I was promoted twice while working for them and never got my raise in pay. as for job safety, this business pride themselves on hiring new young people, they will replace almost anyone."
good,Self-paced work environment. Had to lift a lot of heavy materials by hand with minimum help. I was the only forklift operator in my area. We had to sort the merchandise and take it out to the sales floor to be stocked.
good,The atmosphere was okay and the associates were very helpful. The most difficult part of the job was learning about all of the products. Customer's expected even the new associates to know everything.
good,job is okay. gives you a lot of hours but they dont pay well cause they start you of thru a staff agency so they can let you go at any time. work is every easy.
good,"Too many people fired, no job security. The management fires a lot of people for seemingly meaningless reasons. Everyone is always scared of losing their jobs. Bad environment."
good,Fellow associates were best part of job.  Management was detached and uncaring.  Severely under staffed. There was a mass exodus when I resigned because of store manager and low morale.
good,Good job with great employees. As with retail you can expect to work weekends and holidays. Hours are all over the board so forget a sleeping pattern.
good,Working for Lowes will become your life. Crazy Schedules but the people are fun. Pay isn't to bad but the turn around is huge.
good,"Watch your back if you work here! Managers are there to move their advancement along, they do not care about you!"
good,Used to handle the most menial of tasks. No real chance for advancement . previous job skills not considered.
good,"Fun work place, had a great experience learning new tools and projects. However my management was by far the worst I ever had and things were never done according to standard."
good,"A typical day includes an early morning of physical labor with some pretty good co-workers. I took tests and learned people skilss, sale techniques and was certified in heavy equipment operation."
good,Safety first. Fun workplace. Busy. Load trailers with forklifts
good,I had high hopes for Lowe's when I started there a little over 6 years ago. But due to a lack of communication between corporate management and the rest of the Lowe's employees I have found the experience to be poor overall.
good,My typical day consisted of getting there at either 6 or 7 am. Pulling my product for the day and loading my truck with the appropriate appliances and accessories. Would leave the store around 7:30-8 and get to my first customers house between 8-8:30. I would install the new appliances in the customers house with the help of a fellow employee. Averaging between 4 and 7 deliveries a day
good,The HR is horrible and management needs major improvment not a bad place to work but i dont recommend it
good,I would go into work around 5:30 am everyday and immediately start setting up the front of the store to be ready to open by moving inventory around with the forklift. Once 6:00 am rolled around I would open the doors and begin assisting customers with their requests and purchases as well as begin answering phones.
good,"ok, not many hours and no room for advancement. Plenty of things to learn to help yourself in the future"
good,Gained knowledge of home improvement products. Fast paced environment helps the day progress quickly.
good,doctors have to much going on in office wasnt professional but was a nice job learned alot
good,"Running a cash register, Dealing with people all day, and Of course your co-workers"
good,"Lowes  need a whole new management team.. The management do not stand by the policy and procedures, they are the ones breaking most of the rules. They preach team spirit and yet they do not practice what they preach. Behind close doors they treat the employees unfairly, and I have sent several emails to corporate Lowes  along with other fellow workers also, and they, done nothing to support the employees. When some of the corporate people come in the store, the management tell the employees be on there best behavior. In other words being fake like Lowes is the best place to work for. Truthful the corporate office can careless about the little people as long as there making the BIG BUCKS, you can be replaced very quickly  if you try and challenge them. A lot of unethical things are going on there, I know first hand. Lowes has a High turn over rate If its an incident with a customer, no matter if the customer is wrong. In Lowes eyes the customer is always right. Most of the time the customer is in the wrong, and Lowes stand behind the customer 100%. They are all about making the customer happy and not employees. Should it be equal??"
good,"Difficult management staff, unhelpful human resources department."
good,"I enjoyed helping homeowners with their various projects and home improvement upgrades.  I worked well with customers and asked them questions to help me guide them to the purchases that would best serve their needs, wants, and economic constraints.  "
good,"I like working here, and I like the people I work with.  Dealing with the customers is a lot more fun then I imagined it would be.  "
good,Was a great place to learn everything home improvement. Staff will walk you through everything you want to know to help you do your job better. 
good,I loved working with my co-workers and the customers. I learned a lot about home improvements. The hardest part of the job was remembering what products were on what aisle.
good,"In my time working there The upper management dont know how to run a successful business. they try running it by using the control of an employees job to their liking. they try to get more out of those who are willing to work and give it their all and just ignore those who dont work and dont produce, i wasnt there to earn someone elses check for them iwas there to do my job to the best of my abilities and advance from my position. The upper management would threaten you with the lose of your job if you didnt poick up the slck instead of making those who did the bare minimum to pick up their pace. the write people up for policy proceedures but they would break the rule sworse than any employee and not suffer any punishment as they would enforce on all others."
good,"Enjoyed what I did within my position, managment doesn't handle the problems correctly which in turn causes too many problems."
good,"Meet a greet all customers and provide customer service. Learned to deligate work load, co-workers were all very fun to work with. Hardest part of job was forever changing schedule"
good,Overnight freight and stocking sales floor
good,Greet customers entering establishment in a professional manner
good,"Customer Service Representative,Grill Builder. mangament did not care about temps. co-workers were nice.Buildeing Grills."
good,When I started with Lowe's I came in hopes of moving into management. The training was poor so I trained myself by observing others and asking a lot of questions. Often those who had the knowledge and skills to perform task were overlooked and advancement would be given to people who knew management on a personal level. I had decent pay and benefits and enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"Started out seasonal, was promised a certain Permenant PT job at last minute told I did not have the job so was made a cashier. Tried and tried for months to move to another area - finally received it but left after I got another FT job offer. Long story short FT job did not work out so interviewed with same store for same seasonal position that I started - was not hired as they hired more experienced individuals. I have applied at 4 stores in the area and none of them will give me an interview. Store manager would never let me move into other positions while I was there. Hard store to understand management - felt that there was some discrimination there. Told me that I would get a raise them said I wouldn't because........ then said I would get a raise and then I wouldn't......."
good,I have worked for Lowe's for a year and a half: I have watched 4 entire sets of managers and employees get hired and be fired. It is far easier for them to hire 2 part time employees every 6 months than keep 1 full timer for a year.
good,"Lowe's has a schedule that is not family friendly. The company does not care about the employee's the way they say they do. The management is hit and miss, It's hard to understand why they promote people. Most of the time it's whomever the manage likes, so If you are a brown noser you can do well. They only go by the book when it benefits them otherwise they do what ever they want. There are a lot of double standards.. I wouldn't work for them again."
good,"not a good place to work if you have or want a life. the hours are never the same two days in a row nor two weeks in a row. can't make personal appointments, and so on, nor do they let you advance. applied for 10 dif positions that i qualified for and never got an interview. To top it off, they are not very protective of their employees."
good,Overall a good place to work. Poor management! Very low pay for my knowledge and skills! Had me on a rotating shift of the worst hours possible ensuring I couldn't get another job to pay my bills. The only good thing about working there was some of the nice people I worked with.
good,"Scheduling is terrible, always fretting if your job is the next to be cut  management has favorites, constant drama, if you do your job well you will do other people‚Äôs jobs too with no compensation"
good,"While some ppl there are great, the company seems to be down sizing.  Pay doesn‚Äôt compensate for what you do. There is a max pay, if you‚Äôve been there long enough you will not get anymore raises."
good,"The guys in the pro department are amazing  they honestly care about the people they deal with on a daily bases even if your a diy type of person  they still get to know you to help"
good,You always meet nice people but always a lot of turnover. Amazing how multibillion dollar companies pay you as cheap as they can and pay higher up positions so much more when it's the employees in the store doing the customer work.  SELFISH!!!
good,"I recommend working for Lowes if you don't want long term employment."
good,"They made snap judgments and stuck to them."
good,This company says it is trying to improve but it is pushing talented people  away. I would still work for the company again but under better circumstances.
good,"It is clear that the new corporate structure prioritizes more product placement and name than actual customer service. Multiple hiring events per year just to cut all part time hours within 2 months of their start date. Promotion from within in non-existent, management has little to no communication skills and contradict directives from other managers and themselves on a daily basis."
good,"Hire the proper amount of people to do the job. In my experience in any line of work, if you have the right amount of people and good management everyone is happy and productive. At Lowe‚Äôs that is just not the case."
good,Its a good place to work but we dont get enough hours as Cashiers this job is good for students or someone with another job. Managment can suck because if you need help they will take forever to show up.
good,Company was struggling to stay competitive in the market and employees suffered fro the adjustments for Wall St. The lack of employees n the stroe was difficult.
good,"Store struggled with maintaining enough employees to man the floor and execute the high level of customer service as required.  The workload was excessive and expectations changed daily or without notice. Management was fragmented with no clear direction and caused gaps in coverage, follow up and direction.  Supervision was often left to senior floor associate to train, lead and implement ever-changing job directives"
good,"The Coral Springs store was not doing well at the time I was there.  The store manager was recently fired, due to lack of staff present to speak with upper management, during a surprise visit. Staffing was diminishing, due to budget cuts, yet they really were not capable of firing any employees or even replace those who left.  The employees were being made to learn to operate two departments, due to lack of scheduling in each department per shift.  If someone did not show up for work, there was no coverage. Three supervisors transferred out during the short time that I was there.  Morale was low and there was virtually no employee appreciation.  Other stores are doing much better."
good,The company itself is a good company to work for if you're in retail. However the location I was at needed new management desperately. They made you feel unappreciated and unvalued as a worker.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty calm, a few busy hours here and there but always keeping up with everything and not letting it get outta wack. most enjoyable part is getting to know a few people and work with them."
good,Certain people get advances and achievements.  They don't give opportunities for advancement. The pay raise is a joke. It's just a job. Part time employees gets what's left over when it's come to hours.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes. The customers were a pleasure, very friendly. Management is very unprofessional, mostly fun people that have no clue what they are doing. the overall job is easy, learning the system (cash register) was extremely easy. the front end supervisors make it very stressful to work there. the hardest part of the job to me is keeping the customers waiting for assistance as customer service is very imperative."
good,"The overall atmosphere of the job was wonderful, although the management did not meet expectations. Communication is not a strong quality that management holds, which sometimes leads to confusion and frustration."
good,"Pressure from superiors to achieve goals with unrealistic deadlines is very stressful due to the improper use of a program management system.  The teamwork (on good days) is wonderful and productive but management undermines these days with non-motivational comments.  The duties change daily and this encourages and challenges myself (time management, efficiency, etc).  In addition to this, I enjoy being helpful to customers."
good,Managers were rotated all the time or had their area changed. I found it difficult to keep straight as to which managers were assigned where. I found the job super stressful as did the cashiers.The cashiers were very vocal about the stressfulness they were trying to cope with.
good,You can't control when you work. They do. You always work holidays. Late nights. Can't have overtime. They do train you. They try to make sure you have the tools needed to perform the job. It's a hard balance between trying to have a family life and work. They do no care when you want to work. They make your schedule. Time off can get you fired unless approved and get it in writing.
good,"Management is very inconsistent. I have experienced management tell one employee to do one thing and tell another the total opposite. I have had management experience during my career. I have had great response when I would not just tell or direct employees to do something, but work with them to get a task done. This does not happen at this Lowe‚Äôs with current management.Although there are 2 in management who will along with employees. "
good,"This job was overall an easy job, but it didn‚Äôt provide a lot of hours if you were part time. But it was an overall great place of business when we wasn‚Äôt short handed with cashiers or head cashiers, or in other departments."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and the customers at Lowe‚Äôs and I made some great friends with other employees. I started out being very enthusiastic and optimistic, but the lack of support from the corporation made it extremely difficult and stressful to be as efficient as I‚Äôm accustomed to being. I felt I had a good relationship with our management, and they asked for my feedback and suggestions to make improvements in my department, but very rarely was anything ever acted upon to enable us to be more efficient. The company has the potential to be a great place to work, but short staffing and lack of investing in technology made me decide to look for another job."
good,"It was a nice job to have, but the managers did not make it pleasant at all. The managers were very critical to every employee for not doing the tiniest of things, like having your aisle swept or attending to a customer seconds as they walk into your department. Managers were okay but definitely made me not want to stay there."
good,"I worked at this Lowes Store for a year and a half.  I got to where I could run the entire front from Cash Registers to the Customer Service Desk to the Internet Orders as well as even be a Cashier Supervisor(Head Cashier).  I tried to become a Head Cashier there for a year but don't think this store wants a male in that role as they only seem to want females mainly 20-24 years old.  To me sad they even put girls in the job that were there less time then I was that I helped train.  There is also a lot of Neopotism in this store as well, if you are not related to somebody there you will not advance.  Most of the Management Staff is good, but the two managers over the front are best friends and whenever I tried to advance there the one did not like me and she used her personal opinion to convince the ASM not allow me to advance and tried to blame me for something that was not my fault, the ASM over the front also lied to me about several opportunities.  The ASM over sales is a real Hot-Head and gets mad whenever a phone call is passed to him.  There is another Service Manager that thinks he is top dog with a very dry sense of humor that seems like a bully.  The rest of the Management Team is good, only other thing I can say is the Store Manager is a good guy but as I tried to address these issues with these people in his store he blew me off he is completely clueless as to these Bad Apples in his Store."
good,"The culture and experience started off great! But as the store began to lose money and the salary managers blame the employees, the culture and work ethic began to drop. Would not recommend."
good,Management will do with you as they see fit. Have been sent to four other stores with no notice. Was not told that I would be traveling at all when I came on board. All managers play favorites and many of them don't do much.
good,I worked for Lowe‚Äôs for 5 years before I quit. I tried to get my job back after quitting for personal reasons but I was told my old store manager was saying awful things about me to other store managers at other stores so I couldn‚Äôt get a job there anymore. Anyways while I was working there it was fun at first got promoted a couple times  within a year. And then they changed how management was then it started sucking to work there . It got very stressful to the point I decided to quit
good,"I worked part time at Lowes, the store manager make me to leave the store, they way he talk to me is wired, and he make me to work everywhere in store, and i was doing grate, the store manager make me to leave the job."
good,"Before the new CEO came it was really great working for this company. He made so many unnecessary changes within the company that didn't need to be changed. I used to love my job. Started out as an overnight Stocker, then became an FSA (which they no longer have that position any longer) nor HR they don't exist either. I had tried on numerous of occasions to move within the company. Each time I was turned down before the HR had left the store. Granted she was taking into consideration of the issues I have going on outside of work. Having to go back and forth to court it would be easier for me to take off because they wouldn't need to get anyone to cover my shifts."
good,"They don't tell you as a seasonal employee if you or going to be hired in or not,there is problems with management,they tend to forget your brakes when you are in lumber or garden center,the customers a great I love talking to them and getting to know them"
good,"Once Lowes realizes their EMPLOYEES are where the focus should be, they will be awesome. The employees are the drive behind excellent customer service. Happy employees produce better interaction with customers. Also, happy employees show up for work which will reduce having no support in certain departments and on the registers."
good,"I enjoy my job because I get to help people and have a good support system from co-workers that work on the sales floor with me. Management needs a little help on who they promotion and hire. Also, there is a gap in training if you want to move up the ladder to a higher position within the company."
good,"In short, don't work here if you can help it. I know for certain I did not get paid enough for the work I did. Oftentimes, it would be the stockers who ended up helping unload the truck, since there were not enough people on the unload team, and they refused to hire more."
good,"Low pay, no set hours, schedules changed without notice, able to work very early, very late, all weekend. Great customer service a must. Co-workers friendly & nice."
good,"After working there 11 years, I have seen the ins and outs and all that the company is about, stay away! You never see your family, a lot of broken promises, lots of favoritism. Me leaving Lowe‚Äôs was the best thing I could have done for myself after 11 years"
good,"Constant turnover"
good,manager teams makes it difficult to follow schedule keeps changing without your knowledge and unable to balance work and family they refuse to hold associate accountable for poor job performance however if you do your job most likely you wont have to worry about job stability
good,"I love Lowe‚Äôs for their products but did not like being an employee at this top heavy managed organization. As a manager, you worked all hours. Never understood why I had to close the store being an HR Manager. Lowe‚Äôs would use managers to fill in a n floor. I am the worst cashier ever! Because I was in HR. Eventually- the store location eliminated the HR Manager position"
good,It might not be the best job ever but I had to work my butt off so I can make my hours and put more hours in to hit overtime so I can get a decent paycheck to make ends meet.
good,"Day starts out good with assignments given, then if the numbers look low to the Manager, they ask you to take short cuts and get through the work as fast as you can so the numbers look good at the end of the shift. LOWES Corp. receives money from vendors to display and sell their products But does not follow through with good inventory control or Quality Assurance in storage bays to ensure proper display and pricing is done. In short the Corp take the Vendor money but DOES NOT deliver on the condition of displaying the items for sale."
good,Bad business if you tend to get sick or have an ongoing/pre-existing conditionsany and all leaves and accommodations go through a bad third party that doesn't do anything it is supposed to
good,I am a cashier at Lowe's and if they schedule me out in the garden center our in lumber or in the front end. Then I stay at that department and start checking out customers and scanning there items and the ones under there basket. Then I stay in that department until the end of my shift.
good,unloading freight in a messy receiving area with very little work area and floor people want you to do there job on the floor while they hide in the break room. management is not the best they help there favorite people out and the others suffer trying to get enough hours in a week to get 39 hours.
good,"Throughout my employment with Lowe's, I have endured the obvious perks as well as the faults with the company. I enjoy working with the company because of my other employees; the management team can be a bit troublesome and often unprofessional."
good,"A typical day at Lowes starts with clocking in heading to the customer service desk. For the most part helping customers all day. Helping customers involves processing returns and exchanges, setting up veterans for military discounts, setting up tax exempt accounts in the system and helping with online orders. I have learned that Lowes is not very flexible with their hours and they are very inconsistent. I enjoyed the job but, not management."
good,Never enough help. Too many Supervisors and no accountability hard work is rewarded with more. To cover others. Best advice take your time do what you can in time allowed and go home
good,Most of the associates are hard working people. Seventy percent of the management are Prima Donna's...the other thirty percent are good and will do code 50's or whatever needs to be done. They can't make a schedule to save their life! Favortism. Sad when all they care about is profit...short staff the floor constantly. Don't bother with their once or twice yearly meetings...nothing will change they just try to spin it a different way. Management meetings go on for hours...can't reach them.
good,A typical day at Lowes was usually very busy and hectic. if you weren't ready for fast paced life then you you got there fast. the managers there were very about themselves and didn't really care about the employees. but always made sure things got done
good,"Our manager often says we ""protect the red vest"" but most of the time it really isn't that case at all. Not a bad place to work, but hard to tolerate what some people get away with."
good,"Working at Lowes, I received the training to work  in different departments.  I met new people of different cultures and learned many new things that eventually will help me in the real world."
good,Working at Lowe's is pretty good most of the time but can really only advance if you are in good with store manager if not cant ever move up no matter how hard you try or what you do or how much you learn. They have their favorites and nobody else is good enough.  At least this applies for the store that I am at.
good,Lowe's used to be a good company. I've been there for 20 years but in the past 5 years I have never been so unhappy because of the way I have been treated that's why I am looking for another job. I wish I can give more positive responses for Lowe's but given the way they have treated me lately I don't have anything good to say anymore. It is a good company to work for but I need to find something that respects me as a person in the job I do.
good,"All they do is walk around the store. When a customer needs help, they get rid of them by finding another red vest. Upper management doesn‚Äôt even bother with ‚Äúlower‚Äù employees. I‚Äôve seen the store manager and ASM‚Äôs walk past the cashiers and completely look past them, like they don‚Äôt even exist. Same goes for the floor sweepers. Most of the time you can find the middle management hiding in the front office laughing and howling like they are at a poker party. If the cashiers are slammed and call out a code 3, do you think they come running out to help? Definitely not. They stay in there snuggling each other and pretend they can‚Äôt hear the loud speaker. Schedules are a nightmare. They say part timers are required to be open on Saturdays, but corporate says they don‚Äôt. The schedulers will also take their anger out on you. If you aren‚Äôt best friends with whoever is in charge of scheduling that week, you‚Äôll get all the random hours. Typical  middle management at a retail store. Pathetic, really."
good,"The pay is low. Managers show extreme favoritism by letting certain people name their hours while others get the leftovers. Dress code is out the window, looks more like a gym with all the right yoga pants.. This company will suck the life out of you."
good,"Lowe's for most is not the place to work. It's stressful, they care more about the bottom line than you as a person. You are worker not a person you work for them."
good,"Not a bad place to work, depending on department. Learned a lot about home improvement.. needs to hire better leadership though. Ppl who actually care"
good,"Boring, slow unless weekends"
good,"With extremely inconsistent scheduling never knowing to plan your life out and little to no personal time, lowes found a way to get  worse. By giving out consistent shifts that you work only once you now get two week days off a week, and one weekend off a month. The shift you get is ‚Äúconsistently‚Äù changed week to week and you never know what youre going to work week to week. Impossible to balance a work/personal life."
good,Es un trabajo totalmente promedio nada de especial
good,The employee's are a good bunch of people to work with and some management are fair customers are hard to deal with and don't know what they are looking for
good,"But the management was very poor. The departments were always understaffed which lead to severe workload. And scheduling was unfair. Where i would be off at 11:30(and get home at 12:30) and have to be back the next miring at 6:00  am (having to wake up at 4:30) That means i would only get about 3:00 hours and a half of sleep. "
good,"Job is really slow paced which I‚Äôm not really used to due to me always working in fast paced environments. Most of my co workers were cool. The location was okay, surrounded by a lot of food places and shopping stores. Only thing is I was getting paid $10.80 which wasn‚Äôt enough for what I have planned to do as far as my living situation."
good,"During my time at Lowe's there were many Sales Associates that were allowed to change their schedules, coma and go as they choose. The HR Manager ad the Store Manager were rumored to have been having an affair, one ASM was having an affair with a Sales Associate (Management allowed this to happen). Inadequate Management. Fortunately the management team has departed into other employment."
good,Never make a manager unhappy about you. Never argue with their authority. Always be on time. Always be prepared to do something different each day. Always do what is asked of you
good,"A lot of petty nonsense and drama. Managers who don't really know what they're doing, lazy coworkers who will make your day longer. This is offset by the few people you will work with who are thankfully the opposite. But ultimately it is a retail job. It is a mess. Avoid the crooked or petty Managers and otherwise keep a smile on your face with your head down if you wind up stuck working here"
good,Overall poor management and making decisions with customers.When hiring employees issued interview them and qualify them in the right department unfortunately Lowes does not do this sometimes they do hire people just for a paycheck or to fill a spot overall Lowes is not that bad of a company to work for if you‚Äôre young.
good,"Lowe's coworkers were awesome to work with we helped each other."
good,"They only hire you part time but work you 1 hour under full time so they don't have to give you benefits. The management was horrible and frankly rude. They didn't work well with my school schedule causing me to cut back on classes because i either couldn't make the classes or they weren't working me enough so i could pay for classes. You get write ups for being more then 8 minutes late every time, also when you work before the store opens, they make you stand outside and knock until they feel like opening the door, usually resulting in clocking in late and getting a write up. I do not recommend working for the lowes in Waldorf."
good,"they work with you on schedules"
good,"The managers are not great. The HR personnel is lazy and should not be working for Lowes, the managers bicker and fight with one another, no one has the ability to be honest  and if the store had better managers then the workplace would be great."
good,"While the conditions at work are fine, the management is completely lacking.  The store manager isn't really a manager, he is overseen, excessively by the market director.  He has no ability to do anything without approval from above.  The other managers are likewise unable to do any managing as they are usually involved in down stocking products or dealing with customer complaints.  There was supposed to be a downstocking crew but they are way overtaxed and can't possibly stock a truckload of shelves with products received AND downstock the shelves.  Those tasks are usually left to the floor staff and managers who have to deal with stocking while providing customer service.  Everything is based on the manpower budget as it relates to sales budget without realizing that this promotes a perceived lack of service which in turn drives down sales.  They are constantly hanging on to the tail of the dog rather than holding the leash.  In 20 years, the average sales has increased 3%!  Stock prices have lagged 50% behind Home Depot and the Earnings per Share is $1.04 or less than 50% of Home Depot.  I've never worked for Home Depot but they clearly have a better way of doing business when their sales continue to climb along with their share price."
good,"Currently Lowes is undergoing some major changes in the operations of the stores, closing of multiple underperforming stores. I am unsure where this will lead, as far as programs in the store, including the installations programs. right now there is a question of stability in the near future."
good,"Although I spent most of my teenage years working for them, it is a good paying job for students who need money during college for simple things.  Lowes is some what flexible with your schedule and are willing to work with you if you are a student. Part time hours means mandatory Saturday shifts."
good,"Opening and or closing of department"
good,"Lowe's is not a trustworthy employer. My current supervisor changes my shift with no notice. Discrimination is commonplace. Management selectively enforces their own rules. If they want you gone, you're toast. You are only as valuable as your last accomplishment and disposable as your last (perceived) mistake."
good,The managers do not communicate or respect people that are not managers.  The advancement is on a buddy system.  If they see a problem they make excuses instead of fixing them.
good,Was a great place to work and will be again once the new CEO forces the politics out of the hiring process and enforces his expectation on performance and results at the Regional and Market level.
good,"Sometimes it was fast paced and sometimes it was slow days. It all depends on how many customers we get. You have to make sure you can handle certain situations because some customers weren‚Äôt nice. Overall, its a good place to work"
good,"Fairly laid-back but I guess corporate are up the managers behind so they get up yours. They say they care and act like they do but they don't. Good thing I speak Spanish because every meeting is done in Spanish then English and it's annoying because I speak both fluently, so I keep hearing the same thing twice. I would guess it's like 90% Spanish of some kind at least. If there's even room to move up, you pretty much have to speak Spanish. You gotta be careful too, because of all of the gossip and backstabbing."
good,It is somewhere to work. All places of employment have their ups and downs. All of the employees at me location are great but we are all frustrated with the management.
good,"I didn't enjoy working here due to the unprofessional when i was working there. management will work with your needs, but will give you grief about it."
good,"My job was for the kitchen and bath remodels. I loved the people I worked with;clients and employees. I learned a lot about construction that goes into these projects and was paid well for selling the jobs. "
good,"Greet people coming in and thanking them as they leave. Register work, sweeping, fronting shelves. loved the people that I worked with. Miss them very much"
good,"did not know a set work time"
good,"at lowes not matter the position they expect you to know everythign about the entire store , they ran it like ever person was interchangable with each other."
good,I enjoyed working there until management changed. After that I lost all respect for company. My spouse shortly after that suffered a major stroke and then I resigned my position.
good,"If you make it through the warm orientation and are choosen to work in shipping... DON'T you will regret it! Going in I already stated to the hiring recruiter that I knew I wasn't cut out for shipping based on previous jobs working in that department. But I knew they were already short staffed in shipping so I said heck why not start off while my foot is in the door and show that I'm a good worker. Thinking that if I stayed and at least made it through peak season there would for sure be openings for a department I would be much more suitable for and could excel...I was WRONG! I made it past the probationary period and was hired in and yet there wasn't any chance in sight of moving departments. So naturally I'm going to become frustrated, I already didn't like shipping from the jump, I'm exhausted from OT from peak and any concerns I brought forth to a ""coach"" or HR of my dwindling ability to carry on has mostly been ignored. Meanwhile im starting to understand why there seems  to be a perpetual state of being under staffed. They expect too much, too fast from new employees so people tend to call off or leave early and that piles more work on other employees and they call off and leave early and the can is always being kicked down the road. So people eventually quit or point out, I've literally seen hoards of people in and out of shipping in the short amount of time I was there. It's madness!!!"
good,"change of shifts all the time, with and without your knowledge.  lack of good leadership (I hear now that the manager has changed).  negative attitude from upper management"
good,There was a serious lack of communication between head cashiers to cashiers.  Some days were good and some were very stressful especially at self-checkout.
good,"Was there for 15 years so things change a lot, couldn't go into detail. too much confidential information to share. I had a lot of good times there..."
good,During my time at this Home improvement store i learned how to operate a forklift and how to coordinate with multiple store sections. Also how to help families decide on a Christmas Tree.
good,"Lowe's eliminated their department managers and it is difficult to advance in the company now. Without department managers, there is no ownership in the departments."
good,"Management is terrible to it's core, everyone is able to change the schedule as they please without any regard to their employees. No work/life accomodations at all."
good,It's not to bad a place to work just not a very good place to work. It has little room for advancement for people. Not adequate enough pay to take care of a family.
good,"Lowes is a horrid place to work   there is no sense of teamwork, the management is substandard and certain positions have no option for family life making loaders work every weekend and holiday"
good,"My experience with lowe‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt bad because I worked doing deliveries, shipping & receiving, garden center. What ruined it for me with lowe‚Äôs was lack of advancement if you don‚Äôt kiss your store manager behind you will not advance! The Human Resources lady was very unorganized and it didn‚Äôt make it better that HR and store manager were married secretly have an affair. It was obvious! According to them they were BFF‚Äôs."
good,Upper Management pays little attention to who is doing what. Only those who take their job seriously are burdened with issues and negative feedback. others are able to skate by with little accountability.
good,Working here has it ups and downs. If you are not in good with management then you have a hard time going anywhere. They like to micromanage a lot. You do get hour long lunches
good,"Do your job, make sure it is done too full capacity, when it is your time to go at the end of your shift, communicate with manager and than exit. Very simple and straight forward."
good,"Lowe's is a Fast paced environment. Customer service is the top priority. "
good,"A common day at Lowe's would include a day of standing around, and getting yelled at by management for doing nothing when there is nothing to do. overall it was a good job with great staff but bad managers."
good,The management doesn't communicate well with employees and they don't listen when issues and ideas are brought up.  It is very stressful with little assistance accomplishing tasks when needed.  They change things for the sake of change not when for progress.  The most enjoyable part are the other employees.
good,Dealing with the angry customers is the worst.  They get mad if the store is out of something.  Working the holidays all the time gets old real quick.  Working outside when it's cold is no picnic.
good,Decent place to work with little to no job advancement the only method of advancement is being friends with current management already. Good place to work for a temp job.
good,No Comment.  Nothing to say.  Clock in do your job and go home. Hard work and quick pace.  Expected to get the job done in a timely manor and to help in other areas as needed.
good,"It just wasn't the type of place I prefer to work. Management shows very little concern for their employees, The only reason I chose to work there this long is because I needed to generate income and the store is close to my home. I don't believe all Lowe's are a poor place to work; just this store in particular."
good,No habia posibilidad de crecer debido a que era empresa subcontratada.
good,"The pay is awful. No advancement. Manangent hides, and talks a good game, but they‚Äôre only in it for themselves. Under staffed stores brings stress from working multiple departments."
good,It was very competitive for advancement and the only people who were promoted were those who sucked up to their managers the best.  Too many bad decisions caused people to easily become injured.
good,Management is very selfcentered and has very high turn over. The company is more concerned with sales and profit not the employees. Mgt. has an extreem understaffing problem. Takes too long for filling openings.
good,In the earlier part of my career at Lowe's it was great as time changed an new managers came in there were too many chiefs and not enough lindians.everyone wants to be the boss an get paid but not putting in the work
good,"Like I said before to much stress , no cooperation from management at all, the customer is not the priority for them, just sales, sales and more sales like they push in every morning meetings. the most enjoyable part is to see the customers and try with the less help that we have to serve them"
good,The problem is the in store management. If you work harder than anyone else the best you get in return is ignored. If you voice your opinion you will be told what ever it takes to make you quiet. I personally felt lied to and disrespected.
good,The job it self was medium tempo on occasional times of the month due to special projects of people working with companies. Learning experience overall was easy.
good,Worked here while attending community college for two years. Had some difficulty with management occasionally was a lot of turnover so always a new boss.
good,Stressful due to poor management between/toward other workers. The healthcare benefits plans were not affordable for families or those with small children.
good,"run store on the least amount of coverage possiable. customers get angry. When they did away with all Department managers, some stores found all their department managers positions and they kept their pay. Other stores like mine told us to start looking for jobs outside the company. Some of the Lowes stores called their people in weeks early and left their people go before the January 28th date."
good,"managers were great when I started, but with all the changes in the past year, getting rid of the managers and changing the rolls, the company has gone downhill"
good,"Fast paced, A high learning curve. Very high turn over rate. Learn what you need to fast and you wont have any problems. BE fast with what you're doing and you will be good."
good,"working for lowes is a challenge, they have very high expectations with very poor compensation for that expectation. I spent many hours working through store customer issues with no compensation for the time. outside of the poor pay it is a decent company to work for."
good,"fast-paced mainly because they are so understaffed and cannot retain good employees you are covering all different areas other than your own. Current reconstruction of this company is more like a destruction, Hopefully it will straighten out itself with time. In the meantime it chases off seasoned good employees and replaces them with inexperienced new people that are not trained."
good,"The rotating schedule is detrimental to your family life. if you have a family, you will regret all that you will miss because of the rotating schedule."
good,"Lowe's when I first started, was such a great company to work for! The longer you work there the more you come to dislike it. You aren't smiled upon if you aren't a suck up to the hire ups."
good,I really dont have much to say about this job because you didnt have a say in this job. The customer is always right and if they complain you are wrong
good,"I enjoyed it until a new store manager took over. We lost a lot of good, knowledgeable employees. If you can handle the uproar from the restructuring and loss of management, it should be an okay place to work as an hourly associate."
good,driver load puller / out sourced there drivers  no set secuduel and work every holiday and want you to do more then wast is reasonable over load the truck to a unfit level
good,After management shift job got more stressful not the fault of the manager. Truck would be loaded in the morning. Most days done after delivery's were made.
good,New Management model is not working well the team they have in place.  Moral is low most people feel upper management is not up to the task of running the store.
good,Need better leadership from  the top Management.
good,Spent several months working 70 hours or more.  district manager would publicly humiliate the entire management team in front of customers.  Would consistently require all management team to work 6 day work weeks.
good,"Responsible for fulfilling order requirements for the delivery department to contractors and residential customers. Providing prompt service by answering logistical questions concerning projects. Additionally, involved with the restocking operations of the department. Experience with the order picker, narrow isle reach truck, and forklift."
good,Hard working people get more work put on them. Friends of management get promotions and get to hang out and talk sports and not answer phones or help out.  Can't even call out they guilt you into coming in. Hire part time kids that don't show up for work and still have their jobs
good,The management was poor and the hours are terrible for the pay. There is No overtime pay even though I was told there would be. The only thing I think was good about lowes was the 401K plan and the discount.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, it's the management at a certain store that make's this a bad place. but overall great, retail not for everybody, but ok"
good,"Typical day at work would include helping customers, answering the phone, helping other employees. Management needs help. Love the people I work with. hardest part of the job is the lack of management, and their promises."
good,"my experience at lowe's was good, great staff and coworkers made all the difference. management was okay. I'm sure a lot has changed since I have worked there."
good,The organization it's self is a great company to work for - FUN/Universal Orlando - but the Management in the Security Department leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"The typical stocking job. I helped customers with loading heavy materials into their carts and/or their vehicles while also stocking pallets into aisles, making sure everything was clean and organized, and also unloading freight from delivery trucks. The job was decent, but whomever scheduled the time didn't get feedback with supervisors, or possibly weren't allowed due to some type of corporation protocol, so my hours were wacky and unjustified. At some points I would work nearly 60 hours one week then only 5 the next. It was insane. A lot of people who would be booked for average hours wouldn't show up so they would call me in and I would work, so they tried to balance it out by giving me terrible hours the following week instead getting rid of the people that don't do their job and hiring better people to work with so I didn't have to suffer for their shortcomings. Unfortunate."
good,Need a job to start ok first job . Could be a ok place if management was better pay was better hours are good  vacation is fair benefits would be good if pay was better.
good,"Working there is a pain. Almost none of the managers actually managed anyone, so the store looked and stayed a mess for months. They day shift managers never knew what is going on and when a project that their team was suppose to do that day, it would be delayed for no reason or pushed onto another team or shift instead. Mostly the Night team because they assume that they never actually work or have enough to do."
good,"Do grunt work and pick up the slack that other long-term employees don't feel like doing. Its not bad on slow days where you have the ability to do your job, and then your end of work day clean up, instead of doing someone else's job that didn't wanna do certain things or parts of their own daily jobs."
good,"It was relaxed for me"
good,"Ok place to work when I started over 14yrs  ago, but in the last couple of years it has just become too many people dictating and not enough help... they need better leadership"
good,"Overall I loved my job when staffed appropriately.  When management cut staffing & sales were still high the environment became challenging, and stressful to work in.  Associates were required to handle their work load and the work load of 2 additional associates at times.  Management would schedule individuals to work closing at 11pm and opening the following morning at 5:30am when they saw fit.  Management also scheduled 7-9 days straight and said it was excusable because Lowe's schedule started over on Fridays."
good,"Retail hours of course, poor management, too high of sales goals.  The management was no where on the sales floor.  Poor training, will stick anyone in any department with no previous knowledge just to have coverage.  Poor work/family life can't plan anything due to the ever changing schedule."
good,On a daily basis managment has something to complain about. They do not know how to schedule so you're constantly understaffed which makes customers angry. It is a very negative work enviroment. Which makes it hard for you to stay positive and in a good mood. The hardest part of the day by far is being able to complete the 20 different task we get from each of the 17 managers that we have and meeting all customers needs.
good,"Worked at Corporate 12 years, every single position i held, Management was unaware of what my job was and how to perform it. "
good,"It was hard to get ahead in this company as a cashier, "
good,"The hardest part of the job is having 4 Assistant managers, 1 store managers, and a department manager all telling you to do things their way. One manager talks about the other and the associate is left with the job of fixing the issue. Lancaster, CA is poorly managed and associates are poorly treated. Once you make a mistake it sticks with them and room for advancement is no longer an option."
good,"Deli/Bakery manager is amazing. need to make a more expedient way to fire people who don't do their job call out whenever they feel, need stricter rules"
good,they are going for internet sale and trying to become Amazon and loosing their customer base as well as cutting staff to unrealistic levels leaving very little customer service
good,The pay is pretty good. It's a very fast pace job no matter the position or department. The management is very bright and bubbly but also two-faced. It's different in every store but that's my experience with this particular one.
good,Opportunity to develop face to face customer service. Lack of flexibility on schedules for those who need a second job due to them only providing part time positions. Managers are closed to staff feed back towards improvement of departments.
good,"My Resume shows my experience in a variety of Management functions. The store Manager hired me. After a short time this Manager transferred to Porterville and offered to transfer me there also. I declined. Round trip distance was not my choice. The new manager took over and was not happy with my style. I learned not to offer suggestions. Eventually, I quit (after 3 years)."
good,"Not bad, poor management, bad decisions made from corporate, local management really ensure people come to work, sad as it has potential, bad employees get promoted, depends if you are liked."
good,Don't care about there people who been there for year and not a fair work place. bad pay. They will let you go for the smallest thing . i really don't have many words.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's, but the morale in the store rapidly dropped during my time there. Managers never took responsibility for any issues that may have risen at their level. Felt sometimes like slave labor."
good,Management does not have the employees back. The customer is always right regardless of the circumstance. If the customer contacts the Corporate office the employee will get wrote up whether the employee is right or wrong.
good,I started during a time that they was reducing and realigning the management levels.  It made it hard to get the training needed and to know who to go to for help.
good,"Customer Service is what Lowes is all about. Creating an area where customers are treated as top priority. Although management could've been better at handling certain situations, the workplace culture was diverse and the job was to the point."
good,loved it but was too short. people were friendly and nice. customers were nice and I got along well with them. the area is safe and clean. I would work there again if they had asked me.
good,"Not everyone is treated similarly.  Associates work hard, as do managers.  Some are appreciated more than others.  Not so much what you know, but how well you fit in."
good,"Worst job I have ever had.  The hours were staggered and grueling. Management did not enforce break laws nor lunches and left it up to the employees.  Inventory management, scheduling, and accountability of managers was a joke."
good,"As a customer associate you greet customers, help them find the products they need then your their cashier. Co-workers for the most part were friendly.Management wasn't always around when you needed them."
good,Use to be a great company.. With new changes happening at all stores its hard to say if you will have a job tomorrow.........................................................
good,"Lowes today is not the Lowes of when I started. I left for better employment. The policies and procedures were often left to interpretation of the store manager. If you had a poor store manager, this could be easily abused."
good,Poor management and favoritism. Management has gone down hill since cuts were made by corporate. Not enough staffing. Co workers always calling off...
good,"Stressful work environment."
good,"When Lowe's first came to Canada it was a really exciting time!  Finally a company that put customer service first! Unfortunately it only lasted for a few years, then the focus for the company changed.."
good,A typical work day is to come in and go straight to work.. I learned a new sales system but management drops the ball.  Workplace culture is very discriminatory and unfair. The hardest part of the job was to keep your composure with coworkers and management when yelled at for things that were not your fault. The most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"there is plenty wrong with the lowes environment but as long as you do your job right you should have nothing to worry about. There are set days off which makes balancing life workable, however there is never any help after a certain time. Different managers have different ways of doing things."
good,No longer a place of security. At one time I loved working there. People were just as important as profit. The employees there are extremely dedicated group that love their careers and want to do their best.
good,i truly enjoyed the job i was just let go for no reason. my numbers were with par if not above par and i was still let go. i truly enjoyed working there though.
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  The people employed there used to be fun."
good,"On a typical day I provided customer services including credit applications, refunds and purchases, pulling internet orders, over all general advise of use of products available.  Normally, two 15 min breaks and lunch (1 hour).  Schedule was random, some early shifts, some late."
good,"More than I can count...only 1 in the whole building that could drive a fork lift or any power equipment.,  Dealing with upset customers that did not understand we only had a 60 yr old woman to load their 60 or ? bags of mulch, dirt or whatever"
good,Lowes is a somewhat ok place to work. Management team sucks. HR shows favoritism amongst employees which is not cool. There should be fairness across the board. Salary is wonderful but most are understaffed so you work extra hard and it's not worth it....
good,Too much work for low pay and benefits are not good at all. Management also does not care about employees and promotions are based on favoritism. Would not recommend.
good,Lowes as a whole is alright but they could stand to learn a few things. I worked there for 8 years and was fired for a trumped up reason. My work ethic and performance were impeccable. Mangement need to get off their high horse and realize it's the associates that make the business.
good,Its an ok place to work but their future direction is not in line with my career goals . So I am looking to move on to a different role. The work and the team I work with every day is awsome.
good,simply not enough time and workers to do a good job...the company itself is making a lot of management changes. they really don't seem to care what we go through on the floor. They say put our customers first but yet give us a lot of things to do that takes up most of our time.
good,"I've worked many jobs and Lowe's was not a place I would recommend. Horrible, inconsistent hours, uneducated management, and low pay. There are plenty of better places to work."
good,"The work wasn't bad. Mixture of sales and store management. Also required key cutting, glass cutting, and re-keying of locks, which were easy to learn but not listed as job requirements. Very poor management in my store though."
good,The employee's have a lot of trouble handling small tasks. Most of the time there is only one person who is actually working. But for the people that do work it is an amazing place.
good,"I've never been in such a place that reminded me so much of high school, it's honestly ridiculous. The amount of drama, and talking behind people's backs, the cliques. It's to much. I can't stand drama. This place tops it. "
good,"previous employee. There was not much chance of advancing. Loved the customers,. The Managers tended to play favorites, and their favorites were the employees who handed out compliments , but didn't do their jobs. Frustrating to watch those who did their jobs be passed over often for things they were very qualified for."
good,to complicated for this space besides I do not think they really care to hear of any problems caused by their management staff. ..........................
good,I do not believe the diversity is great.  Love the campus.  I also didn't see where employees could truly advance. It makes it difficult to see yourself advancing.
good,"Poor Management in the delivery section of Lowe's.  Orders not ready to go on the truck.  Had to find and load items myself, there wasn't a loader to help."
good,"Ok company to work for but employment security is a constant concern."
good,"This job is hard work for low pay.  The management when I was there was not very good, and not understanding of work life balance.  Not something I would recommend if you have a family."
good,"There wasn't much coverage in the front cashier areas, nor in the customer service areas. "
good,"decent starting pay, no accountability for the bad employees and more is put on the good. expected to do a 40hr a week job in 20. horrible management."
good,No joy working with a company that hires people to help them and then treats them like slaves and constantly threatens job security. No follow through or follow up from any upper level management that live in the clouds as transparent leaders. Failure of upper level management is evident and if not changed will result in the failure of this company. The current CEO needs to be fired and replaced.
good,"Heavy call volume with strict time restraints make do this job very difficult to do.  Quantity of calls outweighs quality of service even though all calls are recorded and evaluations of performance are done.  I never felt like I had enough time with the customers to properly address their concerns.  "
good,With a starting pay of 10.50 it is one if the hire paying jobs. They are not fair and expect too much with no recognition. Coaches already have their pick of favorites and the guidelines to make E2 are crazy.
good,Employment at Lowes was somewhat effortless for the first few months until some layoffs happened in my personal department. Management refused to hire replacements thus myself and another part time associate was working nearly every day of the week no lunch breaks. Management also would not provide seasonal associates to the department so that aisles could be organized and the customer could be addressed proficiently. All in all work environment and fellow employees were amazing management was lacking skills.
good,This specialty store is moderately busy loyal customers friendly customers coworkers not so much. Management did their job i balance the safe and registers i liked what i did  it may be a nicer place to work at now since most of the people who i worked with are gone
good,It's a good place to work but management isn't so great. The work environment is nice though and most customers are really nice.
good,"You'll be expected to do alot for ungratefull managers. The day you cant, your put on a ""bad"" list. Management walks around like they're God's amongst commoners. If you dont clique up with a popular group here, then management will almost certainly never have your back. HR at the moment is just a snake with a fake smile, who does nothing but walk around looking for excuses to let go of people, instead of making this job better for employments, hed rather just get rid of them, instead of working towards an enjoyable enviroment for everyone to work in. Best advice for people, its just a job."
good,The job demands managerial skills with low pay. They are the best to their customers but workers are slaves. Overall not too bad but needs improvement.
good,"New location just opened in 2016, hired on by a great guy which was a assistant manager, (one of at least 7 at this location).......As a part time position. I requested full time and he said he understood, but the only opening was for part time (20-28 hours per week) and was told that since this was a new store they always hire ""new employees"" as part time and the transferred employees were ""full time"" but that there would be a lot of new hires being weeded out during the 1st 90 day period. (Due to any legality issues so far as unemployment insurance,,ect....Which I get). However he added hours to my schedule to increase my pay until he was transferred to a different department lead and my hours were cut to 8 per week without any explanation...Too bad for the store as I had numerous customer positive reviews for my abilities."
good,"Horrible management with the exception of one or two. So much drama. Unprofessional. Typical day is extremely busy. But you do get an hour for lunch. Hardest part of the job is dealing with drama. When you ask for help from certain managers, they act too busy for you. For birthdays, they'd get a cake and have cookouts often for employees."
good,It needs a lot of work to improve its employees and management relationship.  Working here made me appreciate my previous employer's generosity and support
good,"Lowe's was a great company in the earlier years i was there but in recent times the values that i cherished as a employee disappeared with no hopes of return. A typical day was having to fix problems that was generated by lack of supervision and advice from upper management there was no support what so ever. My co-workers as a whole were great we all pulled together to get what we needed done but as for upper management there was no support at all. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of all that was needed to be done with insufficient staff and getting a response from management of ""get it done"" and nobody coming to help. The most enjoyable part was being able to have the knowledge to help customers fix all of their home improvement needs."
good,Low pay scales and loose personal standards led to low morale for driven workers with little hope for advancement.  National brand awareness and advertising did help get potential commercial accounts in the door.
good,"stock shelfs"
good,"A casual workplace that proves it is a notch above places such as Home Depot, however, its management practices are weak and outdated. The overview of your regional manager is also one of constant criticism and negativity"
good,"Something different everyday. Early mornings and late nights are usual. Long days, and heavy lifting are expected . Pay and Benefits are not as good as they should be. Worst part of the job is the customers that ""know your job more than you"". Sometimes management is not on the same page as the delivery staff. As long as you come to work everyday and comply with DOT then you will have a job."
good,"get in and unload the truck then take the depot that we are asigned to and to the prodecuted up and we olny had a littler time to do it in, didn't feel welcome,"
good,"older Lowes was a good ol boy company, who you partied with and who you got to be friends with was a crucial factor in moving up with the company"
good,Strictly about the numbers and appearance of the store. Customers are most often a back burner issue and concern to management.
good,Lowes offered benefits and treated everyone with good intensions. Could use more employees to help assist customers in a more timely fashion.
good,"Head cashier"
good,When I first started everything was great. Once I became good at my job they assumed I was some sort of magician. Management often can't be found and when found they don't really want to do their jobs. No room for advancement because they rather find people outside of the company. Wages need improvement if they feel one is supposed to do the jobs of multiple people. As soon as a new full time job is afforded to me outside of Lowe's I'm leaving.
good,cashiering is the hardest thing when it comes to a home  improvement store we work as a team; provide the customer with great care; direct them to the right aisle
good,"I learned about many varieties of plants while working in the Lawn and Garden Center, as well as, stocking, zoning, and assisting in the Seasonal Department when other employees would go to lunch."
good,"Great atmosphere with the people you work with, but they expect to much from you when they don't give enough back. Management is fairly cool until they start to pick on someone and pester them. The hardest part of the job is the low volume of customers you get and that has in part to do with being a fairly new store."
good,"Work in my position can be very slow. There are lots of times that i can jump on a register to help the other cashiers, but the work as a head cashier is slow. Handling unlocks is very fun and doing change and loans."
good,"Worked Overnights. I needed 2nd income for personal reasons. Job was fine, but underpaid and asked to do more, and more, and more. All while other employees do little and no one bothers them. Management was ok. Hardest part was breaking your back for no pay. Best part was some of the workers"
good,"This employer is all about getting the customer in the door and buying.  Management is all about management, and could care less about the employees who work the sales floor.  If you disagree with what management does, they will get rid of you."
good,"Team Members were generally regarded as disposable, and there was a feeling of ""today could be the day"" amongst workers."
good,Even though Lowes is a wonderful company to work for the individual locations are a little tough to deal with. If the corporate office would take heed to the lower level employees this would be the best employer ever.
good,a typical day consists at 6am to 3pm 5 days a week with resets and product maintenance. i have learned how to follow saftey guidelines and procedures as well as read blueprints. my co-workers and often times the hardest part of the job but also the part that makes me want to wake up and come into work every day.
good,"Despite having perfect attendance and following all procedures including 3 weeks notice, they did not let me call off work for my 21st birthday."
good,I love my work with the public. The hardest part of my job is nothing.
good,"When I first started at Lowe's over 10 years ago the business had great direction I opened 2 stores and the company was going places then Management changed and it started to turn like every other retail place."
good,I work with commercial contractors providing solutions and alternatives to orders . Cold call new clients and businesses to gain new accounts. Review all accounts  every 30 days to gather any unmet needs of current clients. Inform clients of all prosales and pro clearance products. I learned that you have to train yourself . My team is great ...the hardest part of my job is ...I feel I don't learn anything new and the job isn't challenging. Management teaches you nothing maybe because upper management have nothing to send down the pipe. The best part of my day is seeing my kids when I clock out .
good,"good job. paid great money, and offered decent benefits. enjoyable environment"
good,"Seemed to be a good place to work, but sales have been off and they are cutting hours no one s get over 39 hours even the ones that have been there a while, I can understand my hours getting cut since I have only been working at Lowe's since June. I was hired full time and no labeled as seasonal. hope thing pick up soon..."
good,A typical day would be me going to the Lumber department and doing all the jobs on a list before the store closes. I learned how to drive power equipment. Management would not promote anyone who worked hard. Most of the co-workers were good workers and some of them were lazy. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks for the receiving crew. I enjoyed helping the customers. I always wanted them to be happy when they left.
good,I worked for them for over ten years and had a good time and made some good friends
good,"Typically working 4-5 hours a day"
good,"I would rather not comment on this topic at this time.  But let me just say, the culture presented by upper management is not what one is told it is."
good,"Salarios bajos buena direccion buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Worked at two different locations.  The first one was horrible.  The managers were not supportive, they took forever to help you if you called them for help.  One time it took the manager 3 hours to come after I called."
good,"Boring Home Improvement retail job. Nothing much to say. The management is in and out. What really sold me on leaving was the *blackout* times. One of those times was Memorial day, which happened to be on my birthday. They forced me to work on my birthday as well as not letting me wear a hat."
good,Way too many managers and no one is on the same page with communication
good,Worked hard for little pay. Horrible benefits and poor management.
good,"I took this job to get out of the house after the year-long contract.  I enjoyed the three different jobs I had.  I am being given the option of finding another job or being 'terminated' because of a recent Corporate policy change; I am married and my wife also works there, and under the change, married couples can not work in the same store."
good,Overall lowes was an okay employer. i wish that most of the time i was there that there was more work to keep me busy. there were times where i would come to work and i would end up having to sweep for most of my shift. besides that the people were great management could of been better and more organized.
good,I wish they gave you everything they promised and they dont even give your star reviews they just give you a small raise and they dont discuss anything with you like why only a dime or cani improve or can i promote
good,Fun productive place to work at. Only if you love helping customers with their projects or any questions.
good,It's a retail. It has long usually inconvenient hours and pay is not that good. Co-workers are usually the best part.
good,"I loved the work I did at Lowes. Some of the management that went through Lowes was not that great though. I trained employees on Lowes credit, helped customers with credit problems, and did Accounts Receivable."
good,"Work here only if need to.... Management is not very intelligent, the company looks like it is learning as it goes but failing as it does it. There are better companies to work for and have a good life with, such as Home Depot...."
good,"I lead by example in the office. I am punctual and dependable and expect the same from my colleagues. I have worked primarily in sales for the last few years, selling everything from cell phones and media service to ride on mowers. I enjoy sales because I get to talk to a wide variety of people and enjoy solving problems when they come up. I have excellent customer service skills, I am fast and courteous to all I come in to contact with. I am looking for a position in which I can move up the corporate ladder and would be a fine addition to the team."
good,"A typical day at work involved customers and more customers.   But, it's so much fun interviewing and designing a project for a potential customer.  The smiles and handshakes are ""priceless."""
good,"Work register with little to no guidance.  I learned on my own how to work the register properly.  Managment was extremely minimal.  If I had a question for a member of managment my question was met with blank stares and shrugging of shoulders.  My co-workers were wonderful and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was being left on my own mine being the only register open on a busy day and it being my third day working.  This problem happened often in my limited time working for the company and it was due to poor scheduleing of lunches due to poor managment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was smileing at customers and showing genuine consern when listen to ,while checking out at register, their day good or bad.  I also enjoyed helping customers find products and helping co-workers work the computer system."
good,"Good place to work, in the begining.  But you soon learn whos boss, who helps out, who rides the clock, and how much this (so called ) family atmosphere really needs another step child. Blew me away how they wanted the employees to cheat on the ""employee opionion survey""!  Really??? Just too much for me, dont know how that staff is still in place."
good,Team work is the main factor that everyone tries to be a part of on a daily basis & getting the job done in a timely manner.The hardest part of the job is making sure to make the customer happy with the sale of an item to insure you have explained everything to them for what they are looking for to buy.My co-workers are great to be around & help out alot to get the job complete.The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day when the job is completed.The management team works to better the needs of the store to ensure things are run correctly. I have learned alot in my job field since I have been employeed.
good,Miserable management. Working with the public was the only good aspect of the job.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's Home Improvement can be informative yet challenging based off the market and or store an employee works in. There are several different variables that should be taken into account to determine which Lowe's Home Improvement "
good,Enjoyable customer service experience. A lot of discrimination as far as management and employees are concerned.
good,its retail...not too much to explain here. bad management. no advancement. benefits are ok. no family values.
good,great job...management needs to boost moral at the work place
good,"A typical day of work consists of me stocking shelves, assisting customers by providing knowledge on mostly every aspect of installing different types of floors. My management team as a whole is not very good, they do not interact much with employees and aren't a very friendly staff. The hardest part of my job is staying motivated in a not-so friendly environment, the easy part is interacting with the customers."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the Customers everyday. I would've continued working there, but I kept passing out and then my heart had stopped, so I now have a Pacemaker/Icd and I am doing a lot better."
good,I learned no matter who I talk to - how high up in corporate I go - I would never be taught any other job but my own. My job was to be a babysitter and problem solver. I was hardly ever given anything extra or interesting to work on. I had a lot of down time.
good,I enjoy going to work and talking to the customers.
good,"I like working here somedays, and hate it others. It all depends on how the schedule falls and what managers are working. Some managers wont even acknowledge that what you do is important/."
good,This company has its ups and downs and the managenemt team needs to learn how to talk their staff
good,A normal day at Lowe's was helping customer's figure out what would best help make the house more pretty than it was.
good,"Company would be good if qualified people were running it. No real coverage in store doing less than $30 mil a year. It's a specialty retailer but does not pay you from experience, rather what they think is fair market rate."
good,"At the start of an average shift there are usually issues before even starting...it is typical for installers to show up without notice to pick up product that was not scheduled and still in need of staging. Help to stage orders at the last minute requires pulling someone from another area to assist because of the changes from corporate that have caused once helpful associates to lose the urge to work. When I first started it was really a great place to work, however, with economic changes things have changed drastically and the benefits of being a Lowe's employee have become more challenging to accept. Being an employee at Lowe's, I have learned to operate fork trucks, order pickers, and basic fundementals for installation of the products we carry as well as how to maintain a ""customer focused"" attitude and how to do whatever I takes to make or keep a sale. Management tries to be understanding and helpful, however, all challenges are backed by corporate and what they say goes regardless. The employees really don't have much control, opinions, or ability to be independent of the structure that comes from the corporate level even if it would make things better for the store or the individuals that work there. My co-workers have seemed to have list the drive to complete the tasks they begin and are quick to pass the hard part o every job to those who care because they feel unappreciated and that the benefit isn't equal to the effort they put into things... The hardest part of my job is finding assistance with correcting issues caused by others, while the best part I knowing that"
good,"The employees that were on my level were the best, I loves them. Although the management was not fair at all and I would never consider working for that same Lowes again and would never refer anyone to apply there."
good,"i enjoyed working their until i really got to know some of my employees including my manager . i wouldnt advise you to work at the dollar tree in Perry,Ga ."
good,Work Life Balance and Slect Management were issues. Did have opportunity for advancement.
good,"Responsible for the overall sales and merchandise maintenance of the assigned department. Maintains the department according to company merchandising standards and store operations policies. Maximizes sales of department merchandise and related products. Ensures that all merchandising and operational activities take place on a consistent basis. Provides and ensures quick, responsive, friendly customer service."
good,I love to help customers with product selecting.
good,I enjoyed being trained in several departments in the store. I love Lowes but there is a shelf life to working there. Employees usually work and get along together well. Managers have no time to compliment you on anything or provide you with adequete supervision for anything. The clientel for a Lowes draws some of the worst customers ever. Lowes will train you but be prepared to still be throw into the fire. I am much happier being a customer then an employee.
good,"I enjoy working in the Lawn and garden , and helping the customers , just not used to only have maybe 15 hrs a week I can not provide for my family . I am now working in the lumber dept , but no hours there either."
good,"I worked for this company for 1 year. In tha time I have seen unprofessional management. While at work we were told not to speak to co-workers while on the sales floor, to stand at our designated area and not to move from our area, this led to very unhappy associates. There was also relationships formed with management and associates that were unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers."
good,i work sunday-thursday we go in at 4pm and we stay til we are done unloading the truck. on a good day we get 4-7hrs but they're days were we get 1-3 hrs. they hardest part about my job is we r under staffed some days they are only two people there to unload.
good,"Lowe's is looking for ""yes men"" that can follow not well thought out retail ideas that lack independent thought. if you want to grow and think outside the box this place is not for you... that""s why I am looking for another job."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new customers everyday and creating professional relationships with regular customers. I enjoyed learning about products, lumber, plants, gardening and other departments in the store. Retail environment leads to a minimal work/life balance, LOTS of drama among employees due age and entry level positions. If I was able to advance (I tried numerous times) and there was no where near as much drama, I would continue to work there."
good,Constant change in work schedules..close one night..open next morning
good,"I helped to open a new store; the management staff that was there then treated and spoke to their employees as humans. Once they changed the staff, this was totally lost. Management that was there when I left played too many games."
good,"they cut 3yr ago and cut again this yr. how can you make a life for your self, if your all worried about getting cut from your job."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work and a good starting job. The pay is ok if your an ASM and above, however the hours are long. If your looking for an 8-5 M-F job, this is NOT the one for you. The HR Manager is over worked and underpaid and cannot do his or her job effectively if they don't have support and strong ASM's and Store MGMT."
good,This place is ok to work for but doesn't pay much. it would be better if you could actually receive more for the part time hours that they provide you with but it just doesn't meet up to the expectations of what one would expect to achieve.
good,"Company is Ok. Not enough pay for what you have to go through. Management is very lazy, puts all the work on the employees. Drama, drama, stressful, not enough employees"
good,Management are liars and manipulative. Communication is horrible. No humility. No sense of urgency when approaching true problems. Tasking is overwhelming. Short staffed constantly. Terrible changes with new company CEO.
good,"All the employees are good, kind, and respectful when they help out customers. Managers hardly come out of their office even if we and understaffed. Our store is not good at prioritizing hours and how many employees we are going to have at the store."
good,"watching the company go from great to awful.  It's no longer about taking care of one another.  But cutting hours for the big man and expecting more and more from us.  Taking care of customers, pulling online orders, calling people... and some how taking a lunch."
good,"Honestly If you're just looking for a job then it's a lot of other places to work at besides Lowe's. TI have not seen any advancement opportunities there since I have been there. I work overnight so I'm literally stuck, because they won't allow movement throughout the store when you're already an employee for some reason."
good,It‚Äôs an ok place to work. They make a lot of unnecessary changes in scheduling and policies. Not too friendly to single parents. Management likes to hire people they know outside of the company rather than promote qualified employees already working in the store.
good,"Lowes I've found as a corp. Doesn't care about most employee's in the long run. So if you are looking for something to pay the bills and not something permanent then it is a good fit. However, if you aren't interested in moving up a corp. Ladder then this isn't the place for you. Minimum pay raises and long hours day in and day out with managers that never seem to want to help."
good,"Alot of opportunities for advancement in management positions,  Its a tough schedule if you have a family, hours fluctuate with short notice, expect to work weekends."
good,"I can write a book on Lowe‚Äôs but not today. If you like retail and sales you‚Äôll do well. Meeting new people, working crazy schedules hours and dealing with managers."
good,"I obviously enjoyed working for Lowe's and intended to stay there until retirement. Unfortunately, the new CEO eliminated a lot of positions, including mine."
good,"Sometime I think back to my volume here and regretnhaving put it so much time there. First they got rid of Installed Sales, then they cut the ProDesk team in half and knocked down the customer listing by 20... Wow. I knew I had made the right decision when they demoted the department heads.. Can you believe they actually made them reapply for their jobs ?????"
good,"met lifelong friends at Lowes , but the managers made it horrible.  Managers barely helped with much and got irritated when they actually had to step in and do anything.  Managers are immature and there seems to be an issue with talking down to workers.  They will schedule you 9 days in a row yet would never do the same for themselves and different departments almost never reply."
good,"Over work employees, does not schedule enough people to cover shifts.  "
good,"Management is so preoccupied with meeting corporate expectations, they overlook customers and employees. They are disorganized with scheduling, stocking, management directions."
good,"Cutting managers,  less to accomplish same amount of work. Turnover is increasing.  If you don't mind working all over store, part time, you will enjoy going home soiled, tired, and glad it is only 4 hour shift instead of 8."
good,"If you're working full time, don't plan on seeing your family. You can be scheduled anytime during a 12 hour window for 4-11 hours per day. Days off are completely random and usually not together. Weekends off are only 1 every 8 weeks."
good,"The managers are non-realistic and you will have no luck advancing in your position. This may be fully dependent on the manager and demographic of my store, so I am biased so to say. My store is the only location in the state near the inner city so we deal with a lot of theft and negative customers, but the managers give no support to deal with this, or work/life balance."
good,Typical retail environment where employees are valued as long as they are exceeding projections.  Heavy labor on a daily basis with little to no reward.  Managers are not flexible.  It's a job.
good,Lowe's has had a difficult time finding quality fulltime staff so they hire part time staff that do not feel connected to their job so they do not complete tasks.  The incomplete tasks fall to full times.  Management only cares about district management walkthroughs and do not spend any time on the floor.
good,Scheduling hours are rigid and don‚Äôt allow for appointments or family life. Supervisors don‚Äôt do a good job of training and you‚Äôre forced to figure it out on your own.
good,"Your hours will change every 6 months, your supervisor more so. 5 in a one year period. Without much warning I was put into a shift working with a team two time zones away. Instructions change without notice and you are to keep up."
good,"management only cares about the customer , is not up on current DOT regulations , a lot of days you will have to pull and load your own orders if you want to get done. no one cares how long your day is untill they get the bill for the over time"
good,"For the most part, it is a typical retail environment. Employees are not looked upon as a benefit to the company. Pay is rather low, for the work required. There is a very limited avenue for advancement and morale is low throughout. High level of employee turnover."
good,"Not enough floor coverage, no disability protection. Really nice people. Needs more floor support fo excessive heavy lifting and inventory replacement."
good,The Lowe‚Äôs that I work for is understaffed and unorganized. Poor management on an average day. They are really strict with the overtime policy. Also the new scheduling system is terrible.
good,"Lowe's went through a lot of changes as many retailers do. However when they cut out ASM and made ""Service Managers"" take over more departments, more store responsibility and not increase the pay, it was a nightmare waiting to happen. From what I heard they have learned from the falling sales the impact this had caused, but by then it was too late. I would never go back."
good,Call customers about the repair issues they are having with their appliances and work to solve them. Work with other departments and stored to find the quickest solution.
good,"Good company, bad managers. Customer last. They treat people‚Äôs like the working poor and talk to them like children.  But that how you move up in company and became manager"
good,Management picks favorites - good chance for advancement if you are reliable- great co-workers - downsizing is always happening- don‚Äôt ever accept a new position because they cut your hours first.
good,Started as a great place to work. Continued to be so for a long while. Then new management took over and corporate changes came about. It is not an employee friendly company anymore. The customers were great
good,Must be capable of dealing with the public. Retail customer service can be stressful in this high paced environment. Must be very self motivated. Employer offers only minimal to no training for department specific knowledge.
good,Management has gotten better over the last month but the previous manager that was there was not very pleasant or helpful to work with he made you look like an idiot in front of the customers which was not great at all! However we have a new manager and she seems to be very fair and I don't feel intimidated by going and asking a question or for help
good,The workplace atmosphere is very laid back from a more corporate atmosphere I am accustom to. The employees can be helpful but you are very much an independent employee at Lowes. That I did like because it presents a challenge with sales and customer service that I enjoy. Makes you want to work and push yourself that much harder to succeed.
good,Use to be a great company to work for now with the new ceo he doesn‚Äôt care about employees all he worries with is stock markets because that‚Äôs the way he is compensated he has run off a lot of great tenure employees
good,Schedule is generated by AI program and is not modified to accomodate the people. Management does not recognize the need to change schedule to the best hours for coverage
good,If looking to advance won't happen. Management is the most unhelpful. None of the employees work together. Its basically learning on your own. Breaks are not always given.
good,"We‚Äôve been understaffed for the whole time I‚Äôve worked there. Between a combo of people not applying, low pay, applicants not passing drug tests, issues with positions being posted properly, and the massive restructuring of positions we‚Äôve had a rotating 20 positions open that can‚Äôt be filled. The majority of the coworkers are fun people to go to work with. The slackers get no reprimanding but the hard workers who slip get pulled into the office. It‚Äôs rough to work here. We call it the chaos of LowesLand. Most people haven‚Äôt been trained to do their job properly and thereby are flying by the seat of their pants and learning tricks and tips as they go. The training that is required and offered in orientation is outdated and is no long applicable due to changes in the software or programming of technology that‚Äôs being used. Fairly hard to promote up unless you are in with the ‚Äúcool kids‚Äù. If you are good at what you do and they know they can‚Äôt replace you then best of luck doing ANYTHING else because they will block you in to that position."
good,"The lowes that i work at in particular was and still is extremely understaffed and as a result the people who work here are overworked. Occasionally areas where only one person will have to cover 2 departments. Management needs vast improvements, having gone thru 2 ASMs this year and people being fired or quitting and not being replaced is causing much strain on the store."
good,"Worked their for years and I think the biggest issue is favoritism. If you work hard you get more work to do and if you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs ok. There is not much recognition, and the goals to get a bonus are hard for the employee‚Äôs to reach. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, it is very busy, the people on friendly and so was management until recent they got new managers who are very difficult to get a hold of and don't answer their phones and don't offer much support"
good,"My fellow staff were great to work with, They were helpful in all areas if I ever had any questions. Management was never on the same page about anything. Always got a different answer from each manager."
good,I have brought a lot and learned a lot from my job at Lowe's. There are negatives and positives of every job. I originally took the job for part time hours but I am currently full time and they have changed my position from m-f to a rotation. I am now ready to move on to something different and more challanging
good,"If your single and want a lot of work hours to fill your time, join Lowes delivery. Otherwise be prepared for little to no family/personal time and a constant expectancy to work overtime."
good,"Started as a fantastic place to work, with high hopes of advancement. The coworkers were great and enjoyable, and the management in place when hired were fantastic. When changes were implemented and management were changed out, the work environment drastically went downhill."
good,The store manager was terrible and beyond terrible!!!! Service managers and assistant store managers were quite good store manager treats staff with absolute distain while management under him had to pick up the pieces!!!!!!
good,"The corporate decisions made at Lowe's while I was there put all of the stress, blame, and decisions on the front end without any support from our administrative staff."
good,I was fine for 16 years until the company started to cut all employees with time in to make space for new employees and half the wage.  I would not recommend Lowes to anyone other than college students.
good,Be careful of seasonal.    In training management acts like it is easy to get on as perm.   The management are not good at communication.   Found another job cause I felt they were stringing me along.   Run the store staff so close that a call in or two totally messes them up. Consistently short handed.   Poor training.
good,"It was fine working there, the shifts werent too long and the payrate was fine though i was in community college and it was cheaper, its not enough to pay for university, you can but youll struggle, though the management was god awful, the absolute worst."
good,"very stressful, always having 12 hours of work in 8 hours to do it.  no help from associates or managers.  everyone had a lot of  work to do so they couldnt help others out."
good,"The schedules are crazy.  (Morning, mid, close, with rotating days off)  Pay raises are not consistent.  Depending on what department you work in, can be very uncomfortable (outside garden and lumber)."
good,My coworkers were great but the management had unrealistic expectations that often put myself and others in stressful and dangerous situations. The scheduling was very inconsistent which made it extremely difficult to make plans in personal time.
good,"The management team at Lowe‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt very good at all. None of the managers ever seemed organized, and I don‚Äôt feel that problems were solved the right way once managers stepped in. Certain managers on the job were disrespectful to not only their employees but customers as well."
good,"My job as Night Stocker in the Receiving Department at Lowe's had its good points and bad points and I will list them below."
good,"If your looking for a short term job that pays ""about"" average, Lowes is the place for you. Management has very poor communication between other manager staff and no one in upper management cares about day to day operations until a higher up comes to walk the store. Then in a scramble to get the store presentable they ride staff to get things done in a day or less so they can look good to their boss. Please dont make a career here....."
good,"Computer are obsolete!  But Marvin is up dating that part!"
good,"Its a very fast environment, managers want you to get things done as soon as possible, without help. So you have a lot of work to do for little pay. Coworkers there are rude some see you need help and they won‚Äôt help you. Management there is really bad! I would only recommend if your a student goong to school. But not if your trying to make a career from it."
good,"My biggest issue is that when I put my two weeks notice in, the terminated me. I had to leave to help my pregnant sister, and I had originally requested 13 days off, which they asked me about and then still denied. So I gave notice and they still got rid of me. Other than that, I enjoyed my time there. The environment was positive and friendly. They were all really nice and willing to help me learn."
good,"Great Job, very busy Environment for punch in till punch out . Some Areas lot of Moderate Heavy work. Also Working with Lumber slot.  Seasonal Employment."
good,"Lowe's it's a great company to work, fair payment, opportunities to do as much over time as you will like. Unfortunately, the management is very poor, they are always looking for new employees because a lot of them are very uncommitted persons, they called in, have a poor performance and manners but somehow they tolerate that behavior, so at the end is quite stressful to deal with that kind of work environment, to not mention as in other companies, shoplifters, thiefs are not prosecuted and you can not even call the police on them. It sucks."
good,Ran like a bunch of children at recess.  The only management style known is micro.  Very little support from superiors to actually implement change or processes.  Keep your head down and do just enough to stay off radar.
good,They would work around my college schedule but embarrassingly understaffed. They are cutting hours when we have no one there to cover other departments.
good,Lowes is over all in a great decline closing stores and getting rid of full time employees. Great if you only want part time work with no advancement opportunities.
good,"Upper Management (both store and corporate) is mainly motivated by getting their bonuses, often at the expense of eliminating long tenured employees in order to keep payroll costs down."
good,We're consistently understaffed without any positions posted because management says we are fully staffed. One associate can be expected to cover three departments at once in the middle of the day. Part time employees work more hours than they have requested to work per week. You also can be scheduled up to ten days in a row.
good,Lowes offers good benefits for its employees but the stores are very poor managed they don‚Äôt seem to care enough about their employees to promote them or advanced them especially the younger people that are working which leads to a high turnover and if Lowes paid more attention to their employees they wouldn‚Äôt have such a problem as for the company as a whole difficult to say
good,If you need money then sure. Not a long term career. Managers suck and their managers suck more. It‚Äôs a trickle down of suckiness. And no one sucks you. That sucks.
good,"1 h lunch scheduled, no manager has th same answer, bad communication, get blamed for things you didn't do even though their are cameras they can check, and always procrastinating"
good,Overall though it was a okay working environment good people but rough hours. The managers would not allow you to change your hours when you wanted to change your hours I was forced to work at 4 a.m. in the morning everyday and wait for a truck that was supposed to show up at 7 that never showed up at 7 that only arrived when they wanted to the truck drivers were a little difficult to deal with which also made the job a little bit challenging and then a lot of times the orders would not be pulled correctly and I had to correct the order pullers job which felt like doing someone else's job instead of just my own but overall it was a good place to work with good people again.
good,"Ive worked for Lowe's now twice, the fist time was good I guess but this time jas been nothing but garbage. My manager doesn't know what he's doing. We're getting denied a company policy raise for moving to a true overnight shift. All because they say that they're not obligated to do it. My manager doesnt even care about any of his employees"
good,Lots of changes and Micro managing has taken over to the point the company is making it hard to sell on occasion. Company is changing the way we are paid in the name of change but is really cost cutting and I mean cutting by decreasing our pay.  Has gone from a sales where the company gets your appointment to they are expecting us to get our own much like a real estate agent.  The only problem is the people in charge have never done the job before and do not understand all of what the job entails.  Lowe's does have great benefits and and excellent 401k.
good,Good work environment. Could use some improvements in management. The store also suffers from a lack of employees. During closing shifts it felt like I was the only associate in the store sometimes
good,"if you have had any retail experience prior this is a very similar experience. angry customers, erratic schedule, poor staffing during holidays and weekends. my store in particular has very poor management in regards to tasking appropriately, follow through whether its with disciplinary actions, employee concerns/issues, or accommodations for schedule restrictions, micromanagement on a frustrating and insulting level. Only redeeming factor is it pays significantly higher than most retailers"
good,"I started out really liking this job but no matter what, the place will break your spirit if you‚Äôre there long enough. I saw it a lot in the 5 years I was there. I don‚Äôt know about the other stores but at the store I worked, management was a disaster. Very toxic environment management-wise. Lots of inconsistency. They have a written policy for everything but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they will follow it. Or they will follow it to the letter when it suits their needs. Lots of people are promoted who are completely incompetent. It‚Äôs a joke."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's depends on which managers are on duty. I learned a lot, but management is getting hard to deal with. The coworkers are amazing. The hardest part of the job is staying professional when management is getting mad at you in front of customers."
good,"some of the policies are outdated, cause they basically let shoplifters get out of the store with everything and the employees are not allowed to do anything."
good,"Average day was to perform daily task of put-a-ways (using pick tickets) , loading and unloading of freight from trailers by uses of forklifts and clamp lift, Additional work preform was to prepare emergency loads for natural disasters"
good,"If you want to be overworked and underappreciated, Lowe's is the place for you!  Your schedule will change without notice, many of your co-workers will be slackers, job duties and priorities change daily, management is poor, accountability is spotty, and you will only get trained properly if you have a good manager, otherwise, upper management doesn't care."
good,Pretty steady paced work days everyday of the week. Management wasn‚Äôt very flexible with employees availability when they needed it. Poor communication between management and employees.
good,Lowe's itself is not a bad place to work. Pay is not the worse in the area. The self serving managers should go to school to learn how to be supervisor's first before becoming managers. The problem is bad managers training bad managers. They also insist on a work schedule that favors only a few suck ups.
good,"Too many managers in one store. Never know who to actually listen to. Had managers who literally didn't even do their own job. And on top of that, were extremely rude and not helpful."
good,"Poor coordination between different levels of management,  intentional understaffing leading to unrealistic expectations for shifts, and very high employee turnover rates."
good,It's not a good place to work but it beats a fast food place. The manager is hard to find when need a over tide or customer service. They don't care about you or the customer. Customers have to wait a long time in line because manager doesn't help nor has enough employees. You stand on very hard concrete and your feet hurt after a shift. Your schedule is NOT consistent. It could change over night. You could check it one day and it changes the next. If you need a day off you have to give them 30days notice so scheduled doctor's appointment is very hard. You can have a written warning for anything.
good,"If you would like to advance in your career this is not the place to do so. Of course this has seemed to change as of recent, but when I worked for the company it was not good. I was punished for trying to transfer to another state. I wasnt planning on leaving the company just moving to better myself and family by transferring due to an opportunity and I was punished for that by being given false information by the current store and being put on the back burner by the store who had all of my transfer paperwork."
good,The work environment was extremely stressful and the expectations caused all management to work in excess of 60-70 hours.  I worked upwards of 80 a week as an exempt.  This was not healthy for my family.
good,I come to work ready for the day just to find out that half of the chasiers have called out and i am the only one for the last four hours of my shift. I now became stressed and not wanting to be there.
good,"Poor management support, really difficult scheduling if your full time. No support from management. Co workers are the only saving grace. Corporate has gone from good to bad."
good,"In a salaried position at Lowe's there was a rigid work schedule that had to be adhered to.  Any deviations would result in counseling from Sr District management.  It was very hard to keep employee morale up as store management would focus on negativity, but not rarely give positive reinforcement.  Training was available but had to be done on a store PC and was often interrupted numerous times.  At Lowes, I enjoyed recruiting and keeping the store staffed.  I did a good job choosing candidates that were suited for the job and environment.  Recruiting was done at the store and interviews were often interrupted."
good,If you like to be micro managed and constantly watched like a prisoner this is the job for you. I have been with this company for 14 years and have never been treated as poorly as i do now. All managers that are being hired come from home depot or wal-mart. They will not promote within the company.
good,"Management needs to be reviewed"
good,I've worked for Lowes for around 8 months now and I'm the most experienced worker in the OSLG and full time opportunities were given to other people that had only been there for 2 or 3 months.
good,"Cashier... Long, boring days. Long hours, not a fun atmosphere. Management is very strict. Great training and keeping you safe on the job. Always some kind of training"
good,"Pay sucked, management sucked, depending on who it was.  Job was labor intensive and i was in paint and receiving.  Decent benefits, stupid policies and morning meetings.  Its good if youre just out of school and work hard, you will get overtime and be treated well.  10% off was nice.  You cant really advance and why would you want to, SSMs make $16 an hour and have a lot of responsibilities.  Started at 9.91, then bumped to 10.61, then 10.96.  Then 11.31 after 3 years.."
good,A normal day would include unloading trucks and putting appliances away to designated areas according to the date they are going to be shipped to the customer.
good,"It was entertaining as I was the tools and power equipment Sales Associate.  It was an area I knew well.  I got yo meet a lot of interesting people as I interfaced with the public on a regular basis.  I also made a lot of new, good friends among my co-workers."
good,"This is a prime example of do what I say not as I do Culture at Lowes. You can speak of Leadership and a Service culture but the goal is to back that up with proper goals and activities that support that message."
good,"company put too much on employees to rate high work performance percentages for incentive bonus pay that it creates higher percentage of damaged goods resulting in high employee termination rate, unsafer working environments, and hostile and stressful work atmosphere."
good,"I worked at the Lowe's in Dyersburg TN and I love the employees I worked with minus the managers. They were all kind of rude except a few. My manager lied to me though so I do not suggest working under her! The atmosphere is as you would believe it to be! Loved the job as customer service, I actually believed I made people's day better when they came through my line."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for almost 4 years now and I have never seen such poor management from a store manager and human resource manager. They rather hire externally than promote people who have been loyal to the company for months or even for years. They get comfortable with people in certain positions and refuse to let people advance in their careers, which ultimately makes them leave the company. I have see that happen to dozens of my former coworkers and even to myself. They are flexible with hours for students which is why I stayed with the company as long as I have."
good,I really learned to not like retail. It was good to know that other co-workers struggled with the same problems in the work environment as you. However I loved being around so many different people.
good,"At first it was fun working there but management became so terrible to be around. They were alswaus mad and rude, the two best managers we had just quit recently. The rest make it terrible"
good,"cool place to work once you get the hang of how it goes,the hours sucked and no enough to make a living at all,very fast paced and mostly on your own."
good,"La Habra Lowe's is a good store. They have good managers, however they have a terrible management team. They are good as individuals but have not communication and cannot work together."
good,Not consistent to all employees.  Manager was always covering for his shortcomings.  Good group of employees to work with.  Everyone tried to help each other out.
good,"Store manager in Houma is partial to women and people willing to kiss her a**. Everyone complains about her behind her back, except her minions. Very unprofessional store manager, fake and clique oriented."
good,Its ok. The management can be rough at times and they dont give much room for advancement. The hours are also something that give a bad taste in my mouth. They give maybe 20 hours a week year round.
good,"Not much chance for advancement. Schedule changes all the time; work to close one day, open very early the next. Not very good support of employees; assistance needed on the floor often not available, need for power equipment and operators, need for ladders."
good,"HR in Greenville, Texas needs to learn their place. They have too much ""authotity"" when she should focus more on getting to work on time or showing up period. Managers HIDE in their offices most of the time. They scream teamwork but are only part of the team when someone ""IMPORTANT"" is coming to walk their store. After that they are invisible again. Then they justify paying a little more because they dont tell you that 3/4 of the store is going to go home and your stuck running an entire warehouse with 3 people, a cashier, and a customer service member. Happens all the time and I dare them to say otherwise. Dont let Greenville texas screw you out of money either as they are in the Dallas market and have the ability to pay the right amount of hourly wages. They tried that with me too, didnt work!! This store needs a lot of attention from corporate and dear god I hope they get it."
good,"The associates at Lowe‚Äôs are like a family. Very helpful each other.  Management was nice enough, but favoritism is very apparent.  Good for college students."
good,"Working at Lowe‚Äôs was great at first, than they had me work like crazy. They didn‚Äôt care if I was sick, or stressed out from finals week, and or the 20 customers I had to take care of at once during that week and a day before finals..  My supervisor played favorites after the store had been shut down and everyone cleaned their department. This girl from customer service saw me talking to other associates and went and complainedüòí anyways my Manager however got  upset on my last day, he hated that they decided to let me go..."
good,They enforce policy whenever it is convention to them. It is a decent work place. Make sure to always be on your toes. The work environment is very stressful.
good,"Its typical retail.  Schedule is all over the place, managers and schedulers play favorites. The CEO is new and making A LOT of changes that are negatively impacting the associates."
good,"A shift is anywhere from 4 - 8 hours. If the store is ""slow"", you'll likely be sent home."
good,when I left I was only getting 10 hrs a week that went on for at least 3 months and I can not live on 100.00 a week don't jknow what else to say so I'm saying what ever the minimum says
good,Each day was and adventure at Lowes.  Working with young people was a blessing and a curse.  They had the energy but would call out a lot if there was a party or another event the night before.  The customers were the best part of the job.
good,"No one wants to help anyone ever, they are just here for themselves. They dont hire enough associates to get the job done corretly, then they say you are doing to much work when the job is done."
good,"-typical day at work was very unorganized management was never helpful "
good,"I enjoyed working with customers within this store but the policies they have in place do not make sense and are constantly changing, so it‚Äôs hard to keep up. With the change in corporate management, the stores are suffering as they try to rebrand and rebuild."
good,"company trying to compete with home depot by copying their structure and cutting a lot of positions leaving no coverage for departments. Flexible pay , decent benefits, but management is no help."
good,"I was promised a raise 5 months into me being at lowes for taking the lead morning stocker position, I never go the raise. My direct manager repeatedly kept saying that I would get it but never had."
good,"Job was fairly easy and manageable, even during the hectic spring and summer months. However, the store is constantly understaffed. As a result, you will often find yourself working at times which you did not want to work. Pay is decent depending on your prior experience. Have fun trying to become full-time and not let go during the slow months."
good,The culture is all for change and some changes are not worth the time to renew and have to teach new skills for. The culture breeds futility and does not bring the best workers to the table.
good,It always felt like people were being pitted against each other.  Management did not listen to the concerns of employees.  Did not help with things that were needed for the employees
good,Mostly waiting time and watching the clock tick. Coworkers were often late and late from lunches. Management was never around or helpful. Poor scheduling ultimately led to my 2 weeks notice
good,working at Lowes  was very interesting some associate seem like the got along with each other other just use it as a pay check .Manger seem like the could care   less about anything you shade to say .
good,"Poor management and under staffed, it would be a better store overall if they were able to hire and keep employees. "
good,I like working for Lowes I would work there but they are doing away with my position. You have to be flexible and willing to work in other departments
good,"The job isn't hard, but having incompetent managers makes everything difficult. My managers don't really feel like they should be in management rolls. I have one manager who just barks orders and another who seems bothered by having to do her job, like answering questions employees had."
good,For advancement it was a more about who you knew. Management never did not try to help you move forward. It was all about helping your friends or outside people never withi
good,Over the 3 years I worked at Lowe's the company restructured twice and put good hardworking people out of jobs. They replaced 70% full-time positions with part-time positions and fired over 75% of their management staff with NO notice.
good,Interesting and keeps you on your toes at all times. At times hectic but the people are interesting to work with. Good for young people in school or retired individuals
good,"I was a seasonal employee so there isnt way too much to say except that it was really, really slow for some time and it felt very stiff. We couldnt go more than 10 feet from our register when we were cashiers, unless we were pulled off to go stock then we had more free reign. The management was okay and people were nice enough but overall it was kind of stressful. The machines were a little confusing to learn for abit but you get used to them over time at least."
good,"The employees were fun to work with and most of them pulled their own weight but the ones that didn't made working there even more difficult. A lot of, but not all of, management was exceptionally rude and sexist. It was a great working experience on how not to treat others."
good,Honestly i wouldnt recommend anyone to lowes if your looking for a quick job than fine but isnt stable enough for anyone they say they will give u hours but they dont it was honestly a giant waste of time what they told me and what actually happened were 2 different things they say help your coworks out if they fully need help but when you do you get yelled at for not being in your deparment
good,"My 10 plus year experience with Lowe's was A roller coaster ride full of great moments and some not so great.. Ill start off by saying I met some pretty cool people working @ lowe's some of my best friends still today are from working at Lowe's. the job itself wasnt to complicated depending on the department you worked in, but the training there was sub par. What I mean by that is that they rush you in before your comfotable and expect you to just get it. the pay is low even working as long as I did there I never made it past 14.50 but I didnt mine because I loved it!  Some things can be very stressful there like working in the delivery department, having to not only haul and life heavy appliances but having to do it in such a time that works for the customer and the company, such as being safe and ensuring that you do not damage a customer's house and or the product or hurt yourself."
good,"Work Study students get more hours at the schools then this place."
good,"It was another job, you'll find small dysfunction everywhere.  Lowes was no exception.  Mostly good people who were helpful and decent to work with,  however a few bad apples in management."
good,lowes could be so much better if it were ran like a store and not like a high school you need better managers  that treat every one as the same and not to have favorites
good,"after a while of standing as a cashier your back and your legs and feet start to hurt really badly i had to get a doctors note saying i am allowed to sit when needed because of these issues, i also have chronic migraines and it causes me to miss work and their attendance policy won't accept drs notes for excused absences"
good,Was dissatisfied with lack of opportunity along with lack of communication from management. Applied on several occasions for position of Head Cashier and was congratulated by my co-workers for getting the position. However the person doing the hiring went with someone from outside the company after leaving me hanging for over three months (and the person he hired quit after only a few weeks).
good,working at Lowes was pretty good except the management their. They expected you to know all about the job functions going into the job. So they weren't required to take the time to train you. but they were pretty good with flexibility
good,"If your a teenage just coming out high school this would be the prefect job for you, anybody over 25 don't wait your time. I worked here was i had just turned 21."
good,"I motivate Service Managers, Sales Specialists, Project Specialists and Customer Service Associates to achieve   and maintain excellent customer service by leading, coaching and mentoring."
good,"I enjoy the fast paced environment in the paint department along with working directly with customers to complete their projects from A-Z.  This is the best part of my job at Lowes,customer service.  The enviroment presently is poor due to loss of long time employees and diminished help in all departments."
good,"Very little communication between staff and management, you get more e-mail from the president of the company than you do the local store staff.  Very little happiness in the ranks."
good,Not fun. Never any recognition from superior about a job well done. Lack of communication between the staff and employees. Always being threatened with unemployment
good,Worked in paint dept. that wasn't too bad.  The management was the worst.  It may have improved I have been gone about 3 years now.  Their rules were their own not always company policy.  I dont know if I would ever work with them again.
good,"The hours are about par with what to expect in a retail business. Management is poor, management sprung overnights with only a days notice. They do not care about what plans you have made."
good,Lowes is a ok place to work it all about who you know for advancement within the company. Overall you'll meet some great people but you have way to many chief and not that many Indians.
good,"Warehouse job. Great place to work, however management could be better. Lacks organization from management. Overall, it is a decent job with reasonable benefits."
good,"Previous C-suite became disconnected with employees.  A new C-suite has been brought in and there is hope that some needed changes will occur.  Management needs better training and communication from top-down and elimination of silos is needed.  Too often, employees are not held accountable for their actions or decisions.  Not enough rewards or recognition is given to high performing employees.  There is much room for improvement within this company.  With the fresh ideas and clean slate the new c-suite brings, I suspect we will see a change in the atmosphere of the company overall."
good,"Lowe's is the worst work place you could be. I was actually told by Human Resources that I should never think I deserve a raise... this was the Corporate level. Management does not know or care to know what the faces of the company are doing or thinking. Employee incentives are constantly being removed. The employees that do their job are overworked and disrespected, while the employees that do not work are promoted and receive pay raises."
good,Really unorganized and hypocritical place to work and will never join the Lowe‚Äôs organization again to do business nor attain a job. Needs to desperately work on creating better leaders in business
good,"You can tell which old timers worked with which managers by how they get treated on the schedule and how little work they do. "
good,Poor management but the works were very friendly and fun to be around. Would consider staying just for the workers funny jokes and kind hearts. Over all not to thrilled to leave but happy I am.
good,"My typical day at work would be 11-8 or 2-11 on average. First I will say, The employees were great. I have no complaints about them. Management on the other hand was not so great. You could get in trouble for anything. Basically I got in trouble with my manager for putting it simply. Doing my job. I also got micromanaged by HR for the most ridiculous reason ever. I nearly got fired when this happened and after HR turned their backs on me. The last two managers that they hired were nice though. Also, communication between managers and employees was horrible. We were lucky if it happened. While I didn't want to leave I really also had no choice. In all my first job taught me more bad things than it did good."
good,Good place to work however hours were unsteady and for me they didn't want to work with my school very well. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with.
good,Lowe's is a Steady/Fast Paced Work Environment. It's very Productive along with having Fun on the Job. Everyone is friendly and teaches new hires how to do there job well.
good,"I started off at lowes loving it. I don't know what happened but policies changed as well as management and the all around culture of the place went downhill. people quit, hours were cut, and schedules were ruined. The company burnt their employees big time. I then transferred to another store and was met with the most lackluster group of managers. I was encouraged to drive power equipment without my license on me. I saw people stock product without banners. And had no help or direction from management whatsoever. Lowes in Covina is truly the worst place i've been employed."
good,Scheduling and management need changes badly. Horribly understaffed during large sales events and freight days. High turnover throughout the store. Pay is good but not the hours matrix.
good,The store I worked at never had air conditioning running. It was 95 degrees outside and the management wouldn‚Äôt put the air on. The amount of hours received is horrible. The store manager didn‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs not that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Lowe‚Äôs to work for just not this particular store.
good,long working day with various days and hours worked with no consistant days or hours  weekend and night hours.  shifting your days and hours with no balance for family life
good,"Very long shifts on the concrete, it was hard to work long hours in the heat. Management staff was not considerable of our life. Asked to come in like four extra hours everyday"
good,"I worked on the morning stock crew. The coworkers were fun to work with. There really was very little stress at all. Stock work is very hard and there is lots of heavy lifting. There was very little direction from management and some workers are allowed to get away with not working as hard as others and kind of goofing off. There is really no incentive for doing a good job, just more work."
good,"A typical day at Lowes consisted of following up on leads, assisting contractor's with orders. pulling orders, opening up commercial and homeowner credit accounts."
good,"Wasn't at this job very long but they seem to have a  somewhat decent ability to promote.  My manager asked if i was willing to not join the military and i would be groomed for assistant store manager, but i was able to make more in the military and provide for my family that way."
good,"Ok place to work for a part timer.  Geez this is tedious,I don't have time for all of this.   This review is something I don't like to do.  Lowe's is fine, now leave me alone"
good,"At first, the managers here really seem to care about you but the longer you work here, the less they care about you until they just don't care at all anymore. Pay is good but the way employees are treated is not. Be careful when applying to this company."
good,"Meet co workers were really great to get along with,  it's just that Lowe's did not have enough staff to cover the much needed help in various departments throughout the store. Also I wasn't fond of stopping thieves from stealing inventory. People were injured for doing their and I wasn't willing to put myself on the line for that."
good,Lowes would be better if the wages would keep up with the call center ($13 an hour). Lowes is a fast paced environment. Being part time they do not offer good benefits.
good,I don't want to leave I just have to relocate. Great place to work and helping customers and employees. Its a fulfillment jobs with good coworkers and management
good,"this used to be a great place to work. They have restructured the management they had and hired in younger inexperienced kids to be their service managers and they have no respect and no life experience or experience at all in the areas they are managing as well,"
good,if you don't hang out or are friends with management you don't matter. The job there is to rip people off on installs. The employee's DO NOT know much about the product's they sell not how to install them.
good,Okay place to work if you are content with mediocrity. Lots of turn-over. Sales opportunities are missed among too few employees in an HR focused company. You can feel valued if you are a team player.
good,Lowes had no sense of work/life balance. It's mainly for how the do the scheduling. They would keep more reliable people if you weren't closing one night and have to be there by 430am to open. And the new management system is horrible. I lost so many good bosses and people lost their jobs that have worked there for years because of this.
good,current direct manager just got position and is not ready for it. playing favorites is the way it works. there are other people that are great to work with
good,Over all Lowe's was not a bad place to work. But the hours are flexible every week and never the same.  You cant really schedule any doctor's apps or dental because you never know when you are going to be scheduled.  They only have the schedule ready one week at a time.
good,"Was a ok job, but they only offer seasonal and offer full or part time positions external before internal which was not a fair advantage for anyone..."
good,Hired as a seasonal worker. Was given build sheets for the assembly of products on a daily basis. Was laid off without notice. Work area was too small and made it difficult to assemble products.
good,I was first hired as a hardware associate(temporary) but it was with the possibility of becoming a department manager. I first noticed unfair practices when upper management was picking on an associate because he was considered a dork. Didn't take much time for him to be let go. So I worked in hardware for about 5 months when they placed me as a delivery driver. At that point I truly loved working at Lowe's. and I did great in that department. So good I was asked to apply to go to another store to help rebuild their delivery department. I worked as closely with the department manager as I could. His time was limited though due to him being department manager of receiving. So I took control and had carte Blanche over the delivery department. I trained my Co-driver and selected designated helpers of which I also trained. I got the store manager to get us a brand new truck. As I said I loved it there at that point. But there was a change in store management and they hired someone who did not know what she was doing. Furthermore she had been fired from Target for unfair labor practices as well as intimidating her employees. She placed a target on the delivery department. When she was fired the target she placed had remained. We were considered the best delivery department that store ever had yet they fired my co- driver and tried to force my resignation. They did that on my birthday. I received numerous customer service awards  as my co-driver had to. We respected everyone but in the end no matter how we performed they were never happy. No matter how many customer compliments we
good,"allowed creativity and ability to interface with customers, management and coworkers. there was not a typical day it was always changing which i welcome in a job"
good,The hardest part of this job is remembering where everything goes. You work in a large team with others to get stock up and on the shelf's. You must be people friendly and like talking with people you don't know.
good,"I have worked with Lowes for eight years and find the company very focused on the customer.  It can be stressful at times, but also rewarding when helping associates grow within the company."
good,"NOT REVIEWED .  LOWES Home Improvement November 2017 ‚Äì Current."
good,"My position was a part-time CSA, but was worked like a dog. I worked more than 40 hours a week, was made to do tasks that were not part of my job description/position. Management was a complete joke, they just sat around and did NOTHING."
good,When I first started working at Lowe's it was a great place to work but over the past few years the company focused has changed to the bottom line at the expense of employees and customers
good,If you have a good management team and are able to get the hours it is a very good job. The work is intensive. You have to be able to loft hevy objects and the customers are hit or miss. I wouldn't tell anyone not to take a job there.
good,"Terrible scheduling for this specific store and manager, but nice coworkers. Had essentially no life outside of work, and was over scheduled on the weekends."
good,"As a full-time associate with Lowes, you are not allowed to have a set availability. You must be available from open to close, which in my case was 5:30 am to 11 pm."
good,The turn around is consistent and the management is questionable in many places. It's often understaffed and that leads to unnecessary stress and workload.
good,Lowe's has the most employee unfriendly schedule I have ever experienced. Poor management at both the store and corporate level are the reason they have remained behind Home Depot. Morale in the stores I have been to is abysmal.
good,"Schedule hours change constantly; very stressful."
good,Home Improvement atmosphere.  Benefits could be improved and hours should stay full time regardless of seasonal occupations.  Should have more training for advancement.
good,"workers are very nice to work with, but the mgrs. suck-cut throat anybody store 2522has to be worest mgrs. they have-they are sooooo two face, real nice in front of you but stab you in the back"
good,Lowes is a good job. There is no team environment and management have no culture nor system to how thigs get accomplished. Training is terrible.  Job may effect your personal life negatively.
good,My main issue with this company is the poor performance of the store manager.  There is a lack of interest in the employees and no clear direction from the company.
good,I use to love working at lowes. Until the restructure. It was horrible. The work you hard but don't pay you much. Just a little above min wage. They have taken out almost all full time positions and made everything part time so that they don't have to pay benefits.
good,In the beginning it‚Äôs a funny place to work. New management and new teammates tension and stress everyday. Very cutthroat atmosphere clicks everywhere.
good,"I worked with Lowes for about 10 months, besides the few managers and head cashiers that were fun to work with, it was the customers that made working with Lowes the most enjoyable."
good,"The pay is pretty decent, however, management sucks. They pretend to care about you and your problems but really they don‚Äôt. This company is only about money. If you‚Äôre a part time associate you either get little to no hours or too many hours without the benefits. Some associates are extremely lazy and don‚Äôt bother to show up to work yet they still have a job, but if you‚Äôre new and do the same as those who have been there for a few years and call out a lot then they‚Äôll fire you without hesitation. Now they are laying off several people due to this big tax break and it‚Äôs ether find a new position or get lost."
good,Most of the time we do not have enough people on schedule to accommodate our customer base. Working in Customer Service is very stressful because you have to assist customers in front of you as well as answer the phone by the 3rd ring. Most of the time people are calling for issues that will be addressed by other people on the floor or management and half the time when you call their extension they do not answer so most of my time is spent trying to route calls to the proper department or person. Their delivery department has multiple complaints on a daily basis. When customers purchase things online and come in the store half the time their order is not ready so they have to wait for at least 30 minutes sometimes more or less for someone to bring it to the front.
good,new direction of company is to get rid of all higher paid employees and replace with minimum wage labor and people that have no experience. used to be a great company but over the years they have taken away all positive benefits
good,"Lowes is a good store if your looking for part time temporary work."
good,"At the time, I needed a night shift position due to our home situation. The wife working in the daytime at home, I would look after our young children in the day hours till they could begin attending formal school. I was then free to move on to a day position."
good,"I loved the job I actually did but hated the management, I left because of them which is a bummer because i really enjoyed my coworkers and what I did but the hours are very long and sometimes the days go by slow but if you keep yourself busy it goes by perfectly. I don't know if the management gets any better anywhere else but maybe it gets tolerable, I would recommend the paint department, I only liked working there."
good,"Lowes is an okay place to work, but like other places, there aren't a lot of opportunities if you aren't friends with the management. Their attendance policies are a joke, even if you have a doctors note for missing work, it is still counted against you."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public. Depending on the job or department your in, it could be a very stressful job. When you first start working at Lowes it looks and sounds like a great Company. Things change and they take away some of the perks. Think they care more about racing than the employees and now its all about the mighty dollar for corporate."
good,Helping customer service and going on deliveries and cleaning up store putting away stock;unloading the incomeing trucks thats about it; ok place to work but its part time and not enough hours'
good,Good place to work. Multiple areas to advance into management type positions. Great benefits. Basic retail pros and cons.They are willing to cross train in multiple areas in order to employees to be able to go to other departments and help when needed
good,"I started out really liking the job. It was fast paced and was always busy. Summer was a little rougher because the trucks were about 110 degrees inside. Been there about a year now and now they have us doing stuff that isn't even on our job description. No raise, low pay, and favoritism is all apart of the job. It's not bad if you need a little bit of money on your pocket but other than that I think everyone will be better off finding somewhere else. Like I said I've been there about a year and still no raise."
good,"Lowe's has a great philosophy on helping customers love where they live.  The message from the top is clear however, the problem is at the store level.  Managers don't know what the other manager is doing and you can never get a clear answer on what to do and what not to do, there is a lot of mixed signals.  There is no clear ans consistent leadership, and promotions will often go to the bosses friend not the associate who is not the most qualified.  The best part is the co workers and the support you get from them, if you are just looking for a job Lowe's is a good option.  I just wish they could have better leadership."
good,"Must be open to relocate if you are interested in advancing. long hours and a lot of working 6 days a week. Micro managing, by managers. Must follow company process and policy."
good,working with the public can be difficult and is not for everyone. dont get much help on how to deal with the public other than learning on your own on the fly
good,"It is a very toxic environment, management have no clue what is going on, they except you do way more than what you got hired for and then hold you accountable."
good,Was a great place to work then they became obsessed with the bottom line instead of employees and customers. Like my customers not so much our new management. A few are great the rest hide.
good,"It is a fairly good company to work for, my manager who was the general manager was very fair and consistent. However when i started the company was going through a restructuring program."
good,"Working for Lowe's wasn't a bad choice, the company is fantastic.  It is all based on the management and how much they micromanage everyone.  Understaffed everyday, associates don't want to answer their phones to help other customers, breaks are occasional and not taken seriously.  No department cooperates with one another."
good,"I have a lot of health issues. Lowe's is very accommodating and respectful about it all. The goal for Lowe's is to help you love where you live. They just don't pay enough or give steady enough hours or enough benefits for part time employee's. Pay sucks, people working their 5 years make the same as minimum wage now. A few of the first line of managers suck, they are difficult to work with, don't help at all and sometimes even refuse to do anything for you. The upper management is rather neat, at least 2 of the 3 are. There is no extra bonuses for Christmas, nothing at all. Manager claims to not have favorites, but very clearly does to anyone that pays attention. I'm unsatisfied because the pay is really really awful. With so little support from the floor, front end work is tough."
good,I started at lowes and thought at first it would be a temp. job while I settled in from moving cross country.  However the friendly staff and appearance of advancement lead it to becoming a full time job that for quite sometime I enjoyed.  While companies need to change and shift our store went through a rough transition where management was drastically changed for the overall corporation's benefit the store itself suffered.  As a whole management fell and moral was horrible.  The working environment  became more and more depressing as friends and coworkers became nothing more than a number.  While the oppurtunities for advancement narrowed which was unsurprising; it became clear in our store that the only way to move up was if a specific manager liked you not for your work ethic.
good,"The managers at Lowe's where I worked constantly put the blame on the lower employees and threatened people with losing their job, but smiled in our faces the whole time.  You could get off work at 11 o'clock at night and have to be back in at 5 in the morning, often.  If you don't want to stay later than your scheduled time, expect backlash.  They don't even let you smoke on your breaks."
good,Way to much turnover with little to no direction from upper management. Low pay for stress levels you endure. Management won't address or fix issues that continue to be an issue.
good,"Just my thoughts over an 8 year career with Lowe's."
good,"At first, as a specialist, I was required to work 40 hours at my normal hourly rate, then whatever additional hours at half that rate, the rationalization for which was increased exposure to customers and profit-based commissions. But as the profit margins were continually reduced and commissions began to dwindle, the practice of what we called ""Chinese overtime"" was abandoned and Lowe's actually lost a class-action suit brought by the employees who'd been thus exploited. The forty-hour work week for ""hourly"" employees became a reality, but the scrutiny of their sales totals was intensified. Commissions were discontinued altogether in favor of a slight and very inequitable increase to hourly rates to ""compensate"" for the loss of commission income. For this we were expected to be grateful and minimum requirements of specialists were actually increased, including non-sales related responsibilities such as downstocking, sweeping the store, cleaning bathrooms on a rotating basis, cleaning displays. The whole skeleton-crew staffing model continues to this day."
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 8 1/2 years. Only made $9.23 an hour working in lumber which is a job that has a lot of lifting walking a lot on your back.Had a great manager the first two years, then went to another location"
good,Once you get a feel for your job its not bad. Getting help is not always easy but a few great co-workers make it worthwhile to stay because they are willing to help..
good,"Lowe's is a very slow workplace. I am a front end cashier where I ring up items all day.  For the majority of my day I am standing around not doing much because the flow of customers are inconsistent throughout the day. I am a very energetic person and I come to work ready to work hard and keep busy. When I am not able to keep busy, it is very hard for me to stay motivated enough to enjoy the job. However, Lowe's has taught me a lot about distributing good customer service, processing cash, debit/credit cards, checks, gift cards and many other finance related processes. I enjoy the welcoming co-workers and managers, they are very helpful.  The most enjoyable part of the job  was interacting with customers/ co-workers and processing money."
good,"Great people, decent pay.  Poor management, poor decision making, poor technology. Always one step behind hd. Restructure this year to please stock-holders not employees or customers"
good,"Job is a good place for teenagers or people who love to work in hardware. It can get very boring, but when busy time moves fast. Paint was a fun deparment."
good,"Stock shelves, Maintains sales floor"
good,warehouse duties relied heavily on your ability to move products from storage to main floor for sales display in a timely manner. To include being able to locate items from store catalog listing. The physical toll that the body takes from repetitive lifting of heavy merchandise even with the help of machinery.
good,"Getting the store ready for opening shifts, Greeting customers, processing orders and returns. Handled daily cash deposit's.Closing down store at daily end."
good,"After the recent restructure of the company positions (where they gave the boot to all supervisor positions and provided less than half the openings for them to fight over) the sense of job security, fulfillment, and career development has severely declined in less than a year. The environment has dramatically shifted from friendly to cut-throat. If you are not favored by management you will not last long, you will be replaced no matter how much responsibility you take on and how well you do in sales. I would only recommend this job to someone who is interested in taking a position that is seasonal or part-time well outside any specialty department or management. You can take advantage of their benefits, decent pay, and 10% discount without the drama of having a target on your back if you do so."
good,management was not very good at being in charge it seemed they had no idea what they were doing not meeting the store goal day after day they did shut the store down
good,"Even I was an RTM clerk, my job felt like a dept manager position, had to be cross train in recv. Making sure the merchandise was not damage n recv merchandise in the system as well, help associates from sales floor with any problems that came up when ordering special order merchandise, also shipping boxes with ups and fedex on a daily basis...  was a fast pace job keep me busy every day."
good,like working with my unloading crew they are very good at what they do and i learned a lot from them. they taught me how to work as a team along with others to get the job done in a timely manner.
good,Be careful to research the role and longevity of the role and department you enter.  Lowe's use to be an employer who cared about employees but after recent reorg it is clear they do not
good,"There is a disconnect between corporate policies that benefit the customers and employees and the implementation of those policies. "
good,"It is a good place to start."
good,"Working at that lowes made me want to just quit and walk into traffic."
good,I enjoyed my job as Product service manager.  I was tired of retail and decided to go back to school or I would still work there.  The pay could be better.
good,I loved my job for years and got a promotion. It was a great place to work I just want to try new things. I love the culture and I love the benefits that come along with the job.
good,It was a a retail job. I couldn't handle a lot of the stress due to my injury I have from being oversea. I have a service dog and a lot of employees and customers always wanted to hang all over him.
good,"very difficult to advance in the company , part time hours are considered 1-32 hours but it normally fell about 18 hours a week. the pay per hour worked was reasonable ."
good,"the job is not a bad job at all, just not as many hours, customers can be rude at time, met plenty of good people as all. I honestly just wish they offered you more hours and better pay."
good,"A typical work day was 5-7 hours. what i learned, politics in the work place. "" i did not like"". Management was all over the place, ""to many chiefs not enough Indians"".Workplace culture chaotic, no real direction. Hardest part of the job was having to many micro managers and being given to many tasks at once with no real direction.The most enjoyable part of the job was when and if I did my job correctly, being told so."
good,Leadership is poor. Advancement only for those who are friends with leadership. Workload and expectations are unrealistic. The co workers are the best part of going to work. Upon interviewing the expectation was that the job was not a call center. So I accepted the position. Wrong! It is a call center with high turn over.
good,"I started at Lowes in a different town and a different market with coworkers that wanted to work and advance. So when I had to transfer stores I thought it would work, but I transferred to a store that was the most unprofessional place I have ever worked. I think you really need to research the store before you sign on. Some stores are great and work with you to make you the best you can be, while others will try to break you and give you nothing but frustration and no support."
good,the lowes i worked at was not the best but im sure with everything ilearned and some of the people i experienced the company can be great if it is run properly
good,"Lowe's was a great company years ago, now they don't care about employees anymore. When I started at Lowes eight years ago it was awesome, they cared about what the employees thought, they had many opportunities to climb the ladder,  get promoted, and make more money, all of that is gone! The environment at Lowe's now is one of fear for your job and wondering what benefit or bonus they will take away next, they do not want experience, they want low wage part time workers."
good,"They will not allow you to work over 40 hours a week, had to take an hour lunch instead of a 30 minute lunch.  They have overhauled the management system which hurt a lot of the management"
good,This used to be a great place to work. Unfortunately the structure of management has changed and has left people that have been there a while with no sense of security. They have been going through corporate restructuring.
good,This job was my first job. Lasted there for 5 years. It was alright when it wasn't busy. The manager was a great co-worker but sometimes took things far.
good,"With the restructure of the company, it has become impossible for a management person to get everything done successfully.  The fact that you have to work 60 hours a week and only get paid 40 is not acceptable."
good,A typical day at Lowe's normally is pretty busy. I learned how help customers out more and sell lumber. Management has some things to work on but other than that management does pretty well with their customers.
good,Lowes is short staffed and doesn't provide any help within each department. Lowes is good for a person who just starting to working in retail. I wouldn't recommend Lowes to a person who is wanting to do group work.
good,a lot of manual labor for sales associates and not enough pay. not all employees are treated the same. the company is going through alot of changes at the moment that their employees are not happy with.
good,"The pay isn't bad, but you get capped out. I can't complain about the benefits either. If you become too good in a certain position, you are stuck....No room for advancement/growth or change, you become complacent or bitter. There is a lack of support from senior management and the overall moral is suffocating."
good,"learning special orders in Fashion Plumbing and helping customers re-design existing or new bathrooms from flooring, paint, accents to vanities, mirrors and toilets. Very rewarding to see a customer with a smile because they had finally got bathroom finished and turned out beautiful.  "
good,pay was average. if you had good employees and good managers work was fun. otherwise i couldn't wait to  go home and couldn't stand going to work. worked at two separate locations and had two separate experiences
good,there was a lot of racial profiling and favoritism towards white cashiers over black. A lot of the older full time workers are very rude and don't act professional when in a work setting.
good,A typical day in lowes would amount to me doing my job and then being handed issues in other departments because my managers didn't know how to fix them.
good,"I worked for a great store manager during my tenure with Lowe's. However, typical Big Box retailer with some mangement in place that should not have been managers.  Retail is about servicing the customer, not your own needs and wants. You exsit because customers continue to enter your doors, not just because investors buy stock."
good,"I found it hard to advance though I applied for internal positions numerous times and was also transferred from another store with the promise of a permanent full time job in lumber , yet despite all of my efforts I was informed today (7/19/2017) that my last day would be July 28th.  For the record... not only did they not hire me for the10+ positions I applied for ,they never hired anyone and simply used me as "" a floater "" if you will , working in different departments when they deemed it so doubling if not tripling my work load!"
good,"was there for years paid the bills. not a place you can stay for a long time they want you to bend over backwards for them an when you need them to go to bat for you they drop the ball, even when you find them doing illegal bookkeeping that effects your pay they make up there own rules. just watch your back an you paychecks."
good,"The store manager tends to be rather two-faced despite if you've worked there for over five years or not. However hard you've worked or dedicated you've been, you may be considered more expendable than you think. You're just a number."
good,When I was there the management seem more worries about their bonuses then the employees. No overtime was allowed they actually yelled at me for it and it was their schedule that was the problem. The would not approve vacation time until a week before which makes it very hard to plan a family vacation in  a week. Just bad management there was a lot of issues.
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers and with the Electrical Dept. Lowes has cut back on the number of Assoc working at one time, therefore, one person was required to cover several Dept's at anytime. Several customers needing assistance were not happy when there was not enough Assoc's to cover the floor. Also, had to down stock, zone dept's and put up freight."
good,I like working there because everyone is so customer focused and it is all about helping people. The job I did was pretty easy. Every most of the customers are nice to hardly ever get to deal with a mean customer.
good,"Unobtainable work place expectations and under staffed.. This company has gone through four different restructures in the last 11 years, job dependability is a thing of the past. There's no long term value with this company, I wouldn't recommend taking the ""career"" mindset when considering Lowe's. Perfect for individuals seeking flexible shift work with open availability.."
good,they good when first hired first manger was good to work and cared about the people .With the last couple mangers did not care about anyone the last on only cared about herself .Trying to get rid people with time.
good,"The working day to day was relaxed, with some stressful situations. Very little time off was given, and sometimes it would be taken away without a moments notice. Management was okay but hard to find a manager willing to help out in the day to day operations."
good,Assistant Store Managers just walk around all day and HR is very unorganized and not trusted. They expect too much out of associates and department managers. Starting pay is above average but they work you to death.
good,Company is making a shift to the DIY sector and completely neglecting the common construction worker. See ACE and other smaller outfits take over in this market
good,Depending on the store and people working at upper management. Good job in general.  At my location management didnt know what they were doing and they don't care about anyone but themselves.
good,"I personally loved my job however, the management and the employees are absolutely unprofessional and unorganized. The moment I was hired I noticed this."
good,OK place to work.  Pay was not good.  Too many hours expected.  Poor work life balance.  Upper Management was chaotic.................................
good,"at first everything seems professional . Managing wise it was not so good because where i was working at, the department . when we kept our special orders somehow we were never able to locate it even though we have a special location to store it in. Never seem to find our products always mislocating it."
good,The job is very minimal and can be boring at times but the little things keep you going . Customers are a big part that helps make the day better . Thank you
good,"Hired into Lowe's in Allen, Texas partly as a convenience and partly on a recommendation from an associate in another store. Starting pay and benefits were awesome. The managers were great and most of my co-workers were decent people as well."
good,Lowes is a multi billion dollar a year business. It should focus more on their employees than making money. Lowes is a customer oriented business. The management at the store I work at are clueless. Scheduling is a disaster and personal management is non existent.
good,there is rarely any communication from management.   Upper management cares only about how they look in front of their peers rather than helping customers and exceed expectations.
good,"they pay well, but work you ragged. In one week you'll open then close, don't expect to have much family time off. Turn over is terrible. They work you hard, burn you out, and replace you with a seasonal kid, who doesn't know anything about anything."
good,been there 16 years and has only gone down hill.  felt like they were trying to get rid of full time worker.  not a very safe place to work anymore.  all they want now is part time and low pay.
good,"I was a part time employee working anywhere from 20-35 hrs weekly. Lowes have a high turn over rate and managers are constantly changing and implementing new orders etc. I work there for 3yrs and applied to full time positions, but always seemed liked males got hired before myself and white woman who just started also got a chance before me."
good,"Salarios acorde a actividad y puesto. "
good,Worked in several areas during my time here. Most days were not memorable. I learned a lot about home improvement.  I also learned that I never want to work retail ever again.
good,"Management is vey one sided, they are like puppets on a string. I did learn that it is essential to stay calm under very stressful situations to resolve customer complaints when it appeared that there was no light at the end of the tunnel."
good,"Fun atmosphere with positive employees. As a delivery driver, I enjoyed meeting new people daily and watching Lowes obsess over their customer obsession - huge driver to work hard."
good,"I loved my job, making new relationships, learning new things almost everyday. Doing resets, working with Power Equipment. But unfortunately all good things come to an end. In my case they shouldn't had. I worked with the company for over 6 years. Went through 3 Store Managers and countless Assist Store Managers and Dept Managers. But the last few only got the position because they kiss you know what. Like the majority of management at Lowes, they didn't belong in that position. Power went to the head and they was very vindictive. You would think the hardest part of the job was to help customers and work on your projects but the hardest part was dealing with management. 1674 is a store like no other heck not even the CEO knew we was open to Midnight (only store in the company open that late).  Also no common sense when it came to making a schedule. If I close (4pm-1am) come back on a mid shift 11am-7p and than open 6am the next day where am I getting rest or time for Family? Which they preach about you getting time with family are just lies."
good,Good place to develop customer service skills and communication skills.  Management doesn't seem to care about you and the customers can be kind of mean.
good,"I worked at Lowes foods in the meat and seafood department.  Helped assist guest with any meat related product they wanted to purchase.  Worked primarily in Sausage Works, the company's deli kiosk for sausage only."
good,"lowe's has great benefits available to their employees. the hardest thing working there was the lack of communication between upper management, which lead to disorganization"
good,"Culture is lacking with a high turnover rate. No buy in for LP department since sales is the only number that is pushed on everyone. Salary was poor, even though I enjoy what I did."
good,"Depending on who else was working, I 'd either stock or work as cashier. Both were relatively simple. For a small town grocery store the management was efficient. "
good,the culture is full of fake enthusiasm.   the supervisors are required to fight UI claims and to protect the company at the expense of the workers.  the demands of allegiance of the supervisors is unreasonable.   and many of the supervisors get aggressive when they are unprepared to answer questions.   the job positions require unreasonable corporate devotion and deception.  not honest enough to the public.
good,"This was a great company to work for most of the employees where easy to get along with. The Benefits where great for medical, Vision and Dental. They also have a great 401K plain."
good,"I loved the job. But after a year I realized they were full of lies. Management would tell you, and guarantee something. Then they would never follow through."
good,"Good place to work, not enough hours given. Hour are not consistent. Active store. Good review of job task and product information to inform the customer about."
good,"Could be a great place to work but policies make it stressful. They don't promote from within,bonus system needs a rework. Basically it puts importance on doing minimum/or as little as the next person. Strange they've been in business this long like this"
good,"love working with people, customer service, etc.."
good,"No incentives to excel...unattainable bonus program.  Not allowed to do your job as in customer service, sales, training.  More imterested in appearance"
good,"I actually do not have that many problems working for this company. I enjoyed my job, just not doing managements job without the pay. With every job majority of the time you are doing jobs of other individuals especially management. Unfortunately I was doing this everyday. The people working with me were great employees but just like myself we were down graded by the same mangers we worked for and did their job on a daily basis, so I had enough and left the company."
good,This is a decent place to work as far as benefits like insurance etc. The culture tends to favor one small group of people that can do what they want while everyone else is held to the standards of the company. During peak season there are no days off and you work a lot of overtime. I am looking to move on only because I can no longer do the work physically. I worked on a standing forklift for five years straight and now have hip problems. I had planned to at least work here until I graduated college
good,"Constant reorganizations, poor leadership in many areas that do not focus on employee development. Constant turnover, particularly in finance where career advancement is virtually non existent. Currently CSC has just announced a mass layoff at Mooresville with over 400 employees terminated."
good,".For a salaried position, long hours and hard work. Constant work to be had 24/7 postion, You can make it happen since it is commissioned position. I like it ."
good,Working at lowe's isn't terrible but once I became certified on the forklift and other powered equipment it seemed as if there was nothing else I could learn from the job.
good,"Good place to work. typical day is constant moving and standing, leaned great customer service, management was sometimes iffy, hardest part of job was the shift hours were never the same, you never knew week to week what shift you would have, most enjoyable was serving the customers."
good,"There is a great mix of people at Lowes. It is a great atmosphere and if it were not for the other employees there the job would not have been as and enjoyable place to be. Work days are a staggered schedule, some times you open at 6am other times it is 7-3, or 10am -7pm. there are no set time and no regularity to the schedule. The hardest part of the job is the constant up and down ladders and working on a concrete floor, it is not good for the knees or back."
good,Enjoy helping the customers and making their shopping experience comfortable and satisfying. Being able to assist in other departments.  Meeting the customers from all walks of life.
good,The lowes that i worked for didn't really know how to handle most people or ideas that weren't their own. in fact they let people go becasue they couldn't keep a better track of their financials
good,"Lowes has great works, but poor unreliable mangement. I have worked there for two years and not once i have a bought anything form lowes except for over priced candy"
good,I liked working with the people.  I worked well with the team members and my peers.  The managers were less than desirable as their management skills were not including compassion and concern for their coaches or team members.  A lot of stress and fear of losing their jobs which affect their management style.  Not a lot of good coaching the coaches which was needed desperately.
good,"If your not helping a customer you better be stocking the shelves, no idle time ! Also they put you to work with little or no training you walk around like an idiot for 3 weeks because you don;t know were anything is located Customers come up to you an ask for help and your just a lost as they are, An forget about getting help from one of your fellow associates,their always busy helping another customer or stocking the shelves. Because you get in trouble for talking with another employee instead of working."
good,It used to be a great company until the CEO became money hungry. Laid Off a lot of great managers. Lowe's will be losing a lot of great people due to their actions the last two weeks.
good,Lowe's was a great place to work until they decided to cut my position.  All Department Manager positions were cut and funneled into fewer positions. It's all an effort to cut full time employees and hire more part timers in an effort to pay out less benefits
good,Great enviroment when it comes to teamwork with coworkers and also a great place to learn everything about Home Improvement and Sales specialty and custom designing for customers of all levels.
good,The job wasn't awful it just didn't have a great atmosphere. You could tell you were just there to work and nothing else. The tasks for the job were enjoyable but some of the management staff made everything very strict.
good,"- A typical day at work consists of down stocking and helping customers."
good,"This is an okay place to work if you are like me and need something to maintain while in school. There are chances for promotion and advancement if you are interested.The most difficult part of the job are the customers, people are very particular about what they like for their homes. They should hire more experienced managers in my opinion, or require people seeking manager positions to go through a more extensive manager training program."
good,working for any retai store isnt the best and this one doesnt make it any different. hours arent the best and lets not even talk about the pay
good,I really enjoyed working with lowe's and planned on staying with the company for a long time. Worked the lumber section of the store and loved it but due to the store trying to make sales and save money many of us had to watch 3 or 4 departments all on our own. With little experience in other departments management would push me and other employees to handle customers and their needs without even any knowledge of the merchandise they were interested in. Many times the other employees and myself would tell management of our situations but they never really seemed to listen to any of our situations and problems the store had. So due to the lack of interest I was getting our management I chose to leave the company.
good,"Lack of staff education for each department, lack of staff. Not really bad but ok job. I wouldn't work for them anymore. Nothing else to say about my experience."
good,"The company offers great benefits, and the ability to condense your work week into 3 days.  However, they are not willing to accommodate a school schedule during mandatory overtime, and do not except valid medical documentation for absences."
good,"This place is a cut throat working environment, the management is the worst. They don't know how to do their job.Their is no promotions, the scheduling is a cooperate rotation, the hiring process is a joke. The only thing good about working here is the pay/benefits and some co-workers."
good,A lot of stock work and customer service which I don't mind. Managers work hard and keep the store to plan as best as possible. Usually always busy keeping me on my feet for the majority of the work day.
good,The scheduling is really inconsistent and terrible pay and benefits. It was very clear that the best way to get a promotion with Lowes is to not work for them already.
good,The store I worked ....the store manager had his favorites and not always  following all Lowes policies. He advocated turning in fellow workers for firing for not following  Lowes policies for advancement.
good,"Mornings start off fast, the day gets slower and work deminishes. To many workers not enough work to do. People were nice and friendly."
good,"Lowes is a complete mess from management to employees not doing their job. As per the job description I was told that I will be making local deliveries on a semi truck flat bed while using a Moffet (Fork lift), what I was not told was that I would be preparing orders of those who do not do their own work. They would leave the ridiculously large orders for 1 driver to prepare because they wouldn't do it them selves, as per management they're a complete mess nothing gets done but they expect you to make it happen with no help."
good,"although my availability remained the same throughout the period I was working at Lowes for some reason I was always and scheduled times I had that I was unavailable and when taking it to the people that were in charge they told me they would fix it but they never did. Due to me being a college student I asked would they be willing to work with or around my school schedule once I started and once again I was let down and told they wouldn't be able to. Although, they were working with other's schedules. The environment didn't start off bad but the longer I stayed I soon realized how childish and drama filled most of the staff seem to be, the hardest part of the job happened to be the favoritism, the disrespect, and non positive attitudes. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning more about the items that the customer's were purchasing as well as the customers their self. Even though I knew I was seasonal the way the company handled my last day was horrible, especially considering I didn't even know it was my last day the head manager called me in the office a hour into my shift and told me that the season was up and I'm not the only one who was leaving today and told me to reapply next year, than he proceeded to follow me throughout the store to gather my things."
good,I was pregnant at the time with my first born and it was a high risk pregnancy. The management made me lift things over my weight requirements and got mad when you had to sit in a chair during your 8 hour shift when you had a doctors note. Also forced me to work outside with no ventilation in place during 100 degree days while pregnant.
good,"unmotivated management, absolutely 0 incentive to motivate anyone. worked with lowes for over 15 years. they slowly take away the things than made it a good company to work for and tell you to be happy about it or kick rocks."
good,When I started to work at Lowes everyone was nice and very helpful. After while being there people started drama and who's to say you will get that pretty much everywhere you go. But to me Lowes seemed like high school all over again with the coworkers.
good,Management is bad have favorites as a driver we always get new rules to work by and management is always bending them to fit their liking
good,"Family focused work environment, just wish they didn't take more of my family's time. Hard work isn't optional with this company, its required. if you can stick with it you can really enjoy the J>O>B>"
good,The company as a whole is good but the store itself is not. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. No one is on the same page and quick to point fingers and does not value hard working employees. Will only promote people who they think will be their puppets
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers. It can be a fun place to work. I like interacting with the customers. I just have a problem with retail hours.
good,Enjoyed meeting different people throughout their stay. Worked independently most of time and learned quickly. Always enjoyed friendly conversations from customers
good,My experience has been that their are a lot of employees injured on the job. We are expected to ignore doctors orders and just grin and bear it.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public. However, poor communication among management created a chaotic workplace .There  was not a team atmosphere."
good,"Great company, decent salary and benefits. Extremely bad middle management. Software Engineering managers are very mediocre and encourage and promote similar mediocre people to keep them safe. Its a good place o work except in IT and software engineering."
good,This is a company that sells home improvement items and they are a very large company with a lot of staff they employ at there various locations across the country.
good,Lowes has a good back ground. When in store level of company. Everything is your problem. They hire people with no skills. They only pass a test.
good,Task driven social environment. Most stores have uneducated  inexperienced managers with little or no leadership skills.
good,Good luck getting hours unless you brown nose management. Forget about what department you are hired in you'll get slung pretty much everywhere and you'll be expected to know how to help customers. For example I was hired into plumb and got shuffled outside to the nursery and had to try and help people with flowers which I know nothing about.
good,Keep in mind you are working retail so do not set high expectations. If you intend to move up to Store Manager or above the company will treat you very well.
good,Lowe's provided me with some management experience but was a terrible at work/life balance.  60+ hours a week as an assistant manager.
good,I love my job and the people I work with. I just feel like they do not want me off the front end because they want me to train everybody up there to keep it running properly. I believe i am a hard worker and i deserve to be management by now.
good,"The job requires you to multi-task, know how to prep sandwiches. Organize tasks and the schedules. Overall not a bad beginner job."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is busy, very busy. It was my very first job so I learned a lot being there. I worked their for 4 and a half years so I seen it go through a lot of changes, especially changes in staff and procedures. When I first worked for Lowe's it was very great work experience, good pay, great management, a lot of love and peace flowed there and you can sense it in the atmosphere. As management began changing a lot of that balance went out of the door, It became more about money even if it meant mistreatment of their staff. Their were people who dedicated 8-15 years of their life to the industry who worked their way up that were terminated to hire a weekend team didn't even offer a demotion, They drop hours to the point of giving people 10-15 hours a week so even if you got a raise you weren't getting any benefits of it. Working their requires you to put so much of your personal life to the side they want complete dedication, which wasn't a problem when you actually take time to appreciate and care for your staff, but when you treat them of no importance and as a means to get what you want and not as people and still require the same amount of commitment they shouldn't be shocked so many people started quieting. I seen the entire store be restaffed within a year because so many people quit and relocated and the only people who stayed are people who worked their so long that it would be almost impossible to find a job that would pay them as much on an hourly rate but even they had no desire to be their any longer. They no longer offered full time opportunities  so"
good,Lowes can be a fun place to work. That is of course dependent on where in the country you live. In some parts of the country it is not merit based. I learned a lot of information in relation to contracting and Home Improvement.  The associates are friendly and hard working. They are often not supported by their management.  The most enjoyable part is being able to work so closely with the public and helping individuals complete their projects.
good,poor management from district down to store level. Organization was poor and work was delegated down until the hard working employees were burdened with all of the responsibilities.
good,I felt that they did not do much hands on with you in the training.  If you did something wrong they did not point it out so you could not learn when you did something incorrectly.  They used you but did not really help you.  If you asked they would tell you but they did not come out and tell you that you were doing something wrong not good. They had a high turn over on the employees due to their attitude.
good,"the first thing is when you start it takes a week of computer training before you can start. If you like having a life outside of work you will not get one. you will be lifting on avg 3 times what they say is safe and the turn over rate is insane! i made it for way longer than most. they will tell you no more than 40 hrs a week, but you will get that in 3 to 3 and half days! they are the only department able to do so.They stay so short handed that you have next to no chance at moving up. the schedule changes often and without warning. dont get me wrong i like hard work but after moving 700 pound fridges up 4 flights of stairs several times a day for up to 15 hrs a day as long as i did it was time to go. If your young and need money to save up for something and then quit this is the job for you. the rotation of the schedule makes all of the employees angry as it screws them all, but not more than in delivery. often times when you start a 10 to 7 it turns into 10 to 11 or even 12. then youre back at work by 530 am."
good,"Lowe's was great in the beginning but, after the summer season ended, Lowe's gave me only 8 hours every other week.  I spent more money in gas driving to work than I made in two whole weeks' time.  The management was not entirely organized and some supervisors decided that they had more control and more authority than they truly did."
good,"management was poor, co-workers were lacking, and not trained well enough to do the job properly, when you as for help from co-workers or management they wouldn't help."
good,"Good place to work training was good, and I was forklift certified, I shipped and Received, stocked, cart pulled, and worked well at customer service"
good,"Lots of disorganization. Lack of team work among employees. Bad attitudes among employees regarding management, how things are communicated. Negative atmosphere to work in."
good,I've been a cashier here for almost a year and have also been trying to get out of the front end. When I got hired they said they liked hiring and promoting within this company. That was a lie I have no been considered for any position I have applied for.
good,If you want to work 10x harder than normal just to make a dollar then Lowe's is the place to be. The stores are almost always understaffed and a very negative environment because no one truly wants to be there.
good,"I have worked for Lowes for over 10 years all as a salaried member of management.  The culture is the worst it has ever been.  I believe the individuals that created all the new programs or policies are so out of touch with what an employee deals with on a daily basis.  For example an employee has the potentil of having to complete over 75 tasks, varying in completion time of 5 minutes to two hours, before actually helping a customer.  They state that your number one priority is to help customers but we are told we have to document for write ups for not having enough time to complete tasks.  As a salaried member of management we are asked to do more and more each year but they have reduced our bonus potential more and more each year."
good,"Lowe's is a phenomenal place to work that suffers from a less-than-ideal manager training program which results in favoritism, grudge-holding and inefficiency. As long as I did not have to interact with senior management, I had good days every day and in general I had all of the tools I needed in order to do my job.  However, once you get 'on the radar', it quickly becomes a miserable experience.  I would happily recommend Lowe's as an employer to anybody I know were it not for these glaring oversights in how managers are trained and how they conduct themselves."
good,"Training, time management, accountability were the lowest on a rating scale"
good,"I have had two very different experiences with this company. The first location was a very pleasant work environment. Everyone was positive, team motivated, and easy to work with. I was able to move up within the company 3 different times, with a great, accomplished feeling. The Lowes that I am working at now is very different. As a manager, I have several tasks to oversee. I struggle to do my best due to the lack of attention my direct supervisors give my issues. The demographic is very different, and due to several of the employees being on ""light duty"" due to their age and limitations, I am pulled all over the store, and have limited time to get my own job duties done to my own level of satisfaction, as my work is important to me."
good,Co-workers are fun to work with but comunication with managment is poor. A night shift is stocking and top stocking product that came from the dilivery trucks. All product must be cleared out of receiving and in their home or put up in top stock.
good,"Management expectations are high, with little compensation, scheduling is not conductive of family time. One manager doesn't communicate with another and leaves you holding the bag."
good,"A typical work day is processing merchandise customers return, making sure its not faulty and all the equipment is there. Answering the phone processing internet orders, and making sure the area is clean and neat."
good,There are several managers and some are tolerable and some you don't want to ever talk to. That goes for the lead cashiers as well. This is just my part-time job until I get a full-time somewhere.
good,Although I was hired as part time the hours were very low. I believed I worked 8 hours one week. The other associates were a pleasure to work with. Wish I had more training to do the more advanced part of the job.
good,administrative tasks as well as set ads and  customer assistance.  Filing and compliance for Michigan pricing laws..Put away freight and assist in departments as needed
good,Lowes is a great place to work if your just looking for an easy part time job. The job is hard physical work which is good if you enjoy that type of work. The management is not dependable so you will have to handle many problems on your own. Overall not a bad place for an easy part time job.
good,"Opening store reports on a daily basis and doing closing reports on a daily basis .Taking care of customer needs on a daily basis is first priority . Getting store ready for business making sure all departments are ready and up and running smoothly each day. Having the right team members are a big plus now a days and honestly at this store it is hard to find good workers for a good team , but we manage.Mostly  enjoy helping customers with their needs when they come into the store .You  make them happy when they walk in and they leave it's a good impression on the store for them to want to come back."
good,"A typical day at Lowes I would be on register from lumber to the front end to outside garden, I was also required to do customer service where I would answer phone calls, answer customers questions to the best of my ability, submit online orders and have them set up and ready for customers to pick up.  The management while I was there had changed several times.  I enjoyed all the employees I worked with on the front end, that I worked with on a regular basis.  I enjoyed being in outside garden the most."
good,"Very Unpredictable schedule, a very simple job that was easy to learn as a cashier. Terrible medical benefits and very little promotion opportunities."
good,"Work environment was ok.  Management like to play favorites with those who were in the clique.  They wanted you to drop everything for them, but if you had something... oh well"
good,Typical big box store environment.....Everyone is trying to get sales at any and all cost not realizing that if you take care of the customer they will take care of you.
good,"Massive customer interaction"
good,"Lots of hard manual labor when we have truck days and resets which is no problem. I've learned how you can climb up to management. Management is ok, when you have a problem that is out of your hands or you can't make that decision, you can never find them or they wont talk to the customer instead they have you tell the customer what they said. My co workers is what has kept me there and have motivated me. The hardest part of my job is not having a department head that doesn't know his own job to help teach you what you need to know. The most enjoyable part of my job to pass on knowledge to customers and helping them out."
good,"Definately a company that compensates well based on previous experience.  No room for advancement, but mostly great people and fun management."
good,"Not only am I responsible for selling merchandise, but I also have to make sure that those who've ordered with me are follow up with every after their installation is completed, It is fast paced envornmetn but that is how I thrive"
good,"It is a hard place to work, not because of the work but because of the politics"
good,"they don't promote based on qualifications, they target an individual for promotion and fudge the interview to meet what they want it too. I tried to take a demotion (20% pay cut) and was told I did not show enough enthusiasm for the job? Other jobs I have applied for I have been by far the most qualified candidate but failed to garner even an interview. "
good,A good job for somebody still in school. Other than that i would not work for this lowes
good,Assist consumers with building projects.  Stock the low inventory.  Help keep a clean store.
good,Attend my job to accomplish my assigned duties and leave at a timely manner.
good,Enjoyed this job. I ended up leaving because the HR manager kept passing me up for job promotions. There isn't much room for advancement.
good,"The people you work with on the floor are great and most are willing to teach you what they can. From what I've seen, there isn't really room for advancement, they always hire from outside of the store."
good,Lowe's is a fine company to work for but I'm not sure they care about their associates the way they say they do. A lot of things are done to look good for the district and regional managers but after they leave it's back to normal business. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all that's asked while tending to customers with no coverage. There are too many tasks/customers and not enough manpower. You dedicate all your time to a place and get no time for your family.
good,"A typical day very hectic but I learned a lot of remolding and installs of windows, doors, flooring, and roofs. The hardest part was the management they were never cassistant or on the same page."
good,Learned a lot about different retail processes and inventory management. The overall management was very hit and miss.
good,Learned to enhance people skill. Receptive to learning new methods of business culture.
good,At typical day at work could be a very fast paced environment. I learned how to strive for the top positions while working for lowes.
good,Worked with old women and did much of the grunt work my self. As they said they couldn.t lift.wft??
good,"This job at the DC was eye opening in that i learned that sometimes making more money is not as important as your over all happiness and well being. The managers would smile at you while they told you how much you suck at least, I spent a lot of time improving at my job and gave it my best shot but I am glad that I did not get picked to stay there. All the coaches for the most part I had left after I did which tell us how great a place this is to be if the supervisors were walking out of their jobs."
good,Ok job for shortterm but depressing after a while. The management is horrible and non of them are on the same page. Hardest part is putting up with the disorganized management without stressing yourself.
good,"I learned tons about Lowe's but nothing when it came to dealing with rude customers. Had so many customers that just came in sour and no matter how nice or helpful you were they stayed mean and rude. Had a member of management called, only to be told they were busy. Co-workers are a great family really nice, unless your in the front then you have to deal with the rude cashiers."
good,"‚Ä¢	Described merchandise and explain operation of merchandise to customers. Maintained knowledge of current promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices. Placed special orders and called other stores to find desired items. Operated a cash register to process cash, check and credit card transactions. Guided customers in choosing items that reflected personal style and shape. Replenished floor stock and processed shipments to ensure product availability for customers."
good,"Typical day for drivers starts with hoping there orders were pulled the day before. if not pull orders load the truck check all item for delivery then wait for department manager to check and sign you out.  What I've learned is that you must document everything you do. Delivery Department Manager, needs a lot of improvement.  Co-works were great we all worked together so we can do our deliveries of the day.  the hardest part of the job was sitting around waiting for the manager to come check and sign you out.  Sometime it took 2 hours.  the most enjoyable part was making the deliveries and helping the customer."
good,Ridget work structure. Company could not compete. Location was WRONG from the start.
good,Management is horrible. There is nothing but incompetent people working there that give horrible advice.
good,"While there are many hard working, and competent employees here, there is a lack of fundamentals. The management style is reactionary , with a severe lack of communication throughout departments and co workers. I have however learned a lot with this company, but my commute is too far and I need a job with more of a challenge."
good,I started with the store before it was open to the public and worked for two years and was treated poorly and management were like rabbits in heat jumping from one person to another it was terrible.
good,The hardest part of the job is figuring out which policies the management on duty is going to decide to follow on that given day.  They all do their own thing and it makes it hard to do your job when you have multiple people telling you to do different things that contradict each other as well as store policies.
good,The company has really fallen to pieces over the last few years. They are more interested in making a dollar than the safety of their employees. Management is basically nonexistent and do not like to do their jobs. Most of the time employees are stuck with having to deal with situations that management should be dealing with.
good,"Enjoy engaging with the customers, fast pacing environment, enjoy the outside garden center during springtime"
good,"Depending on what I was doing that day. I worked in all kinds of different fields. With stocking, cashiering, sacking and helping with customer service center. I learned how to help customers best to their needs, and learned how to work a register. I made good friends with my co workers there. The hardest part was having to fill in for no shows when I had other jobs that needed to be done. Most enjoyable part of the job was, the options to move up. I went from sacker, cashier then stocker and was working my way into the bookkeeping area."
good,Management was lacking in major ways.  Only one or two good managers that listened to their employees and was willing to help or even hear your side.  Too many brown nosers....some managers seemed like they had a quota of write-ups that they had to do so there were individuals that were getting wrote up for stuff they didn't even do and some who were getting wrote up for doing what they were told to do by management.  Everybody started out at different amounts which is fine except that they had people fresh out of high school with no experience coming in making more than some 30 year olds who had been there a year or more.
good,Good part time work. I learned useful skills from the employers here.
good,"I learned about different plants, trees, soils, and how to water properly. I learned about interlocking stones as well as how to lay them, also about sheds , outdoor power equipment, pesticides and patio furniture while working in the seasonal department Working in the lumber/ building materials department I learned about different types of lumber, concrete, shingles, downspouts, drywall and compound, studs insulation and concrete boards."
good,"Working with Customers all Day, fulfilling the needs of Flooring Projects."
good,Terrible remarks and very focused on making people feel bad and overworking the new employees while everyone sits in the back drinking coffee
good,"Like to work in a positive can do environment at all times.  Enjoy working in finance, real estate, insurance sales and as a notary."
good,I liked working here at first. Management can be very unfair.
good,"Great learning experience and good co-workers. Can be stressful if not prepared, but learning to be apart of management and control shifts is a good tool to have. you pick up on time management and how to resolve problems."
good,"Clock in and go to the returns/ customer service are. I would assist customers in returning items, credit apps, and ringing up final sales. There is some great managers that work there. I loved working with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours. I enjoy the people I work with and the customers."
good,"Lowe's is a huge home improvement company but does not know how to improve within the company. Lowe's has too many programs and wants to change but has no clear direction on how. Its sad because when I first started with Lowe's I enjoyed coming to work and then the company made everything so difficult. Reaching the 30,60 or 90 days safety BBQ was impossible. Having mandatory Store wide meetings never were mandatory. Store management only complained about everyone and everything. Change starts at the top and it never happened."
good,Cashier all day customer service it was part time only got 15 hrs a week
good,"typical day consist of answering phones (switch board) pulling orders for customer, placing orders."
good,"Lowe's.  Corporate Policy is key.  It may not jive with customer service needs, but Lowe's doesn't care.  Stores are grossly understaffed as soon as the summer season is over.  Day shift associates are forced to do long stints overnight, regardless of their family/health situation.  Management is not held accountable, but is quick to beat up the lower level employees."
good,"I Worked at Lowes for over 4 years, I was a Plumbing team leader and I knew lots of things about plumbing because if my rental property experiences, however once i was doing great in plumbing them moved me to indoor power equipment. then to paint, i became a paint pro for a year then i got moved again to cashier and other odd jobs. I think lowes or at least the one i was at has no idea what they are doing by constantly moving people around for i was not the only one this was happening to. Im sure the customers would benefit more from the employees that are Pros in their own area not just a little here and there. I also was hired in at a higher pay rate then i left at 4 years later. I think it was an alight job but tought to deal with long term."
good,Lowes was a great place to work for until a year ago when they went to the new programs they are going to and the took all the upper management staffs responcablitys and placed it on the departments and made it harder if not impossible for the department managers to finish their daily tasks
good,Typical day starts at 9:00pm and begins with unloading delivery trucks. Merchandise is then taking to designated areas within store and stocked on shelves. The night manager is very relaxed and helps us with whatever is needed. The best thing about this job is the people I work with
good,This job just wasnt for me. there is no place for advancement. Family life comes 2nd while working at lowes. Standing is required throughtout your whole shift and the management shows favoritism.
good,"Designing Kitchens for customers, helping customers where ever needed. to always listen to the Customer. "
good,"learned alot,very busy in Lumber,unloading loading of trucks,helping Customers in anyway,understaffed immensely,good part discounts on tools"
good,"I work at the Lowes University Store also known as 480."
good,"all day answering phones, for customers,installers and vendors. updating information on customers, product, install dates/scheduling,  and  complaints, pay bills, pull orders for upcoming installs and process paperwork."
good,"Its not as bad as some retailers but they do have you work a rotation that requires you to work a 6 day stretch without a day off then you work a split day off week. "
good,"I accepted a job with Lowe's in order to broaden my customer service skills, by being able to interact in the retail environment, completing sales, offering extended protection plans, My Lowe's card, ect. On a daily basis I deal with two types of customers, those who are professional, and those who are not."
good,"I was lucky enough to have a good crew to with with at Lowes. Although the Management at Lowes is poor, Managers tend to trickle down their worklist to Department Managers and CSA's. Management is lazy at Lowes."
good,"The job was rather simple, but often there were many people who would not show up for work or would be late (typical retail). Every day was a gamble to see who would and wouldn't show up. "
good,"-	Provided problem resolution strategies for intense store/customer relations "
good,Benefits not so good. Too much favortism. 15 years and could not get half day off to go to school meeting.
good,"good to customers, lots of products and helpfull employees"
good,"I enjoyed my position; I learned the computer systems, I learned how to offload trucks and sort inventory of appliances."
good,Every day I came to work as the delivery manager I felt as that if I made one mistake it would result in disciplinary action. There wasnt a day that I felt comfortable in my job.
good,"Great for full time employment, horrible if your a contractor..No security at all"
good,"typical day qt work,receive trucks,processing po,special orders.helping my clerk with paperwork.on computer processing rtm and calling vendors for credit."
good,Love helping others in customer service. The projects and duties were easy and managable. The compensation and advancement.
good,"Typical day at work for me was taking care at lease 5 to 10 cashiers at a time. Making sure they got all the items prices right. Helping customers if they needed something. Taking change to the cashiers when they needed it.. Making sure the cashiers are busy at all times.. What i have learned was dealing with very angry people is not easy at all. Management was not to bad, Co workers liked some of them but some was not very nice so i just stay away from them.. Hardest part of the job was dealing with all the cashiers at one time.. I would get a call for one then right in the middle of that one you would get a call for another.. Most enjoyable part would be the customers again they always made my day...."
good,"Please the customer at any means necessary while still maintaining a profit for the company. Management helps only when necessary, most co-workers are unmotivated to perform needed tasks."
good,The pay for the Position was good. But the Ethic and moral values of the company are in questions i would not recommend anyone to work for this company. as they have no concern for any employee's that they have.
good,"Fun dealing with customers, learned alot about building materials etc. Sometimes heavy lifting is involved"
good,"A day in Receiving is very busy, fast paced, and need of attention to detail and good organizational skills. I learned that there are alot of ways to do this job, but doing it the correct way is the best way! Management wasn't always what it seamed, in the time I was in Receiving, we wen't through 3 different dept.managers, and they always think they know more than you do!!! I loved my co-workers, they were always there for me and helped me in every way when I needed it and vice versa. I think the hardest part of my job was giving it up after 2 years and having to switch positions with the RTM clerk. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with a great team of people, including the delivery drivers and the truck drivers you got to meet every day. But I think the most enjoyable part was leaving every day knowing that I did my job well and completed every task and did not leave anything open or unturned."
good,Lowes is a decent company with good benefits. I am currently employed there but i can not move up so i am forced to look else where to expand my career. They pay system is flawed and lets employees who have worked there for a while get payed less than the ones that are recent highers.
good,"Store opened in 2009. Was a smaller store with distant location. Business was slow, had to find other jobs to keep busy. Co- wrokers were fun to work with. A lot of good people that wanted to feel appreciated. I enjoyed that I lived 5 minutes away from my job."
good,"The management at this Lowe's location, continually overlook long time employees to move up in the store. They promote new hires with less experience, only to have those people quit later. They use cashiers with experience to fill in for head cashiers and then hire others for the head cashier positions. Employees are friendly to customers and each other. It's just the department managers and store manager that treat employees unfairly. There is no sense of loyalty to other employees and that makes some employees not care so much about the job."
good,"I work with alot of great people and i enjoy meeting new people everyday. I just feel that i am going no where in that field as a Customer service associate at Lowes, I am ready to branch out and start myself in an enjoyable career."
good,knowledge of all electrical devices in which how to connect and use customers seek information on how they work or what they need to replace.
good,"This job was very hands on with the customer. So helping people was a daily thing, a rewarding thing. The management was mixed, but the upper management, held out on making you full time. So there were not benefits for most. The hardest part of the job was the working every weekend, and also, lifting the stock to shelves. The best part was helping people, then going home knowing you had put in a full productive day."
good,Lots of opportunity to learn abouth the products you sell. The hardest part about this job was coping with a work schedule that changed week to week. I did meet a lot of nice people and made some friends as a result of workin here.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's when I first started. A cashier has one of the most simplest jobs. Cashier's work the front end of the store including Customer Service, the Garden Center, Lumber and Self Checkout. The store is the busiest during the beginning of new seasons. I am sure that different stores have different atmospheres. The best part of the job was the staff that I worked alongside with and the customers. The job is simple you scan merchandise and process a payment. There are standard procedures that you must adhere to during every purchase but nothing that is challenging. It can get quite boring when the store isn't busy and you have done all of your stocking and maintenance of the front end. The worst part of being a cashier at Lowe's is standing at Self Checkout which requires little to no activity at all and dealing with the thieves at Customer Service/Returns. The hours are not flexible at all and your schedule is subject to change at any time without notification. We were also always short of people. If someone calls out they rarely call people to come in and work and it makes the workers that are already there suffer in turn making the company look bad."
good,I learned alot from lowes. Management skills different departments. Forklift trained. Plano gram trained. Excellent in any task given to me.
good,its a ok work environment except for some workers for lowe's don't do there job and expect all the plant essentials to do their work then blame it on the plant essentials who don't do it the right way when it plant essentials workers job to help not do there job.
good,i liked working there but i was told that if i could not work what they needed me then i was going to lose my job there i had it to were i could work and then be at home with my son
good,Messy work environment
good,Lowes is only acceptable for those who need a transition position between professional careers. The thought of having to work the sucky shifts they offer while dealing with clueless/mean customers for an extended period of time is enough to make a postal job look attractive.
good,"On a daily basis i had a chance to interact with customers and gain experience in more than just one department, such as paint department, tool world, hardware, etc,"
good,"its a good place, i enjoyed the experiences i had there being that it was my very first job ever. i just didn't like how managment was. has favortism. (hope is spelled it right)"
good,"Management was unfair, did not apprieciate the cashiers, did not consider values and wishes, no opportunities"
good,"Typical day at lowes ,fast paced put up freight within five hours in several departments. learned that sometimes took long enough but some of the management staff at lowes do credit there hard workers like myself.management they are very laid back not always on your back, but at times I which more follow up on some associates would be done. My co-workers at times they slack but what group does not,I at times am the leader in my group I motivate answer question for training purposes. The hardest part of my job is waking up at three am to be to work for four am. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work out and exercise ,I get from throwing freight up also having weekends off is the second best thing."
good,"always busy , time went fast, like the costumers.... there was always something to do,"
good,"After working for Lowe's for 5 year, I have not been given the opportunity for growth or advancement within the company. I have been on several interviews for various positions in Lowe's, but have been brushed off, being told that I am too good at what I currently do there. I have a 4-year degree and years of experience in the customer service industry, yet Lowe's is not willing to give me any opportunity for advancement."
good,great place to meet friendly people(customers). very enjoyable seeing valued customers weekly
good,"Lowe's is a decent company with decent core values written into their structure. The failures seem to happen almost directly at the store level. At the store I worked at in-particular, we were run constantly on a skeleton crew and were not properly staffed to handle the tasks delegated to us. Management is utterly uneducated in regards both to basic Human Resources and Economics. On any given day you can expect to juggle upwards of four or five customers, often with little to no training on a subject. High rationale and logic skills are a must to simply not lose your wits in these scenarios."
good,From what I can remember working for this company was that I did enjoy meeting new people that came into the store to buy items. The management was not that good as well with the H.R. either. It seem that if you were not buddy's with some of the people worked hire then you that you were not worth their time or effort. I had a few coworkers that I did enjoy working with everyday and there were some coworkers that I did not enjoy working with. The managment could have been handle better as well going by the handbook on getting breaks. I have learned from working there is life is never easy and if you want something to happen for yourself you need to speak your mind or ask questions. The most hard part about my job was leaving the company. I left behinde some wonderful and true coworkers. I enjoyed working with the public and learning something new everyday.
good,"Customer Service, Answering incoming call, Renting out the truck, Taking payments."
good,long hours little pay no say so in job area just work where they tell you too
good,range of task that go unappreciated and one can easily be replaced.
good,"Lowes can be a very good place to work if management was more professional and considerate to employees. I worked for lowes 2690 for 2 years. Management is near a failing mark. I recently requested for a transfered to store 0186, because 2690 had cut part timers hours even lower to 10 hours a week and that was rediculous. I couldn't even maintain my rent. I spoke to management about it and was given a deaf ear, so I asked for a transfer. I went for an interview at store 0186 and a week later I was sent an email denying me the position I applied for. I couldn't believe it because the position was open. The store that I left, 2690, had given me several certificates in the midst of all the employees, acknowledging me of superb performances on the job. Therefore why did store 0186 rather hire someone outside of the company, than someone already within the company, who was thoroughly trained and knew all of Lowes policies and procedures, and who was recognized for great work? Note that this transfered request and denial, just happened January 2, 2012. HR at 2690 tried to help me, but the head store manager did nothing at all. To make matters worst, HR at store 0186 had an attitude. Now you can put 2 and 2 together and see why I feel the way I feel about Lowes and some of their management. They get paid whether they come to work or not, so some of them don't give a dam about the hourly associates, and it's worser for part timers. With that said, you draw your own opinion, because I'll never walk into another Lowes again..."
good,if your a manager they expect you to be there over 50 hours a week and get paid for 40. They promise bonuses but rarely if ever happens. would only work there as a stepping stone. Management cannot be trusted.
good,Lowe's helps you learn about the department you work in with vigorous training.
good,"I would not suggest 9mile in pensacola fl ,anything other store would be alot better. There management doesnt know what is going on and 2faced on resoultion to problems. I have worked at all 3 and this is the most unprofessional store of the 3. People that work the most are requried to do more. The store manager is unprofessional at times and one sided to improve proformance in employes. I hope District manager review how unprofessional he can be at times. When you speak up to help the COMPANY they say worry about you. This manager puts people in departments that have no exper"
good,"I helped build the new store in Laurel Md and just before it opened I got moved to a different department, which was not my choice and there was no added pay for the move. After being there 2 years I made team leader in my department and got the same raise as the person who did not do his job in his dept. I wanted to go to another dept but was told I was the back bone of my dept. Lots of managers telling me they would get you more money but not one got me anything. I worked over 40 hours many times and came in on my day off because some one would call out and I lived close to the store.But when it came time to get paid for the overtime I was told to go home early because they would not pay overtime. When I got sick one person from my dept came to see me in the hospital. HR did nothing to help me. I was going to come back, but when I showed up and asked where I was going to work I was going right back to the place that made me sick. Managers change more than I change my socks. They give you the ""were all family here"" but if your not in the click, LOL for get it. People there work hard but only the ones they want get ahead."
good,"Didn't last long, didn't like the store manager, or the job. The company handles bad numbers by letting staff go. Always hard to find somebody to help, and now I know why."
good,"I have been with Lowe's for over 15 years and I have seen my fair share of change, but lately it seems that Lowe's has forgotten about keeping there associates at least remotely happy.  There have been a lot of changes since the new CEO has taken over, job cuts, position eliminations, scheduling changes.  Since these changes store moral has gone down hill, full time employees don't even get 2 days off in a row any more all you days off are split, and if your willing to wait 8 weeks you will get a weekend off, some days you work 10 hours and some days you only work 5 hours, not knowing one day to the next if you position is going to change or it you will even have a job, and low wages for the work they want you to do.  Benefits are good though and that is why some associates stay and endure all the change. That is why I could only give a 3 star rating."
good,It‚Äôs a growing company with good benefits but is very demanding of time and availability. It‚Äôs under a new CEO and office management so sometimes the direction of the future is unclear.
good,Some employees learn to use and abuse the human resource department by going outside the initial store to regional management and factiously make up stories.
good,"Choose your position wisely as some of the jobs are much easier than others but the pay is slightly different, I worked in deliveries. You had to pull sheet rock,cement  flooring tiles etc Load and wrap them and put them on a flat bed truck in all kinds of weather. A cashiers day is way less physical. Decent company choose your position wisely"
good,It is who you know not what your knowledge is. Customer service and making a sale was more important even making shore you were selling the right product to customer.
good,I am looking to make more money.  The benefits are good at lowes. I feel that my qualifications can be beneficial at a diffrent company. I feel that it is time for a change.
good,It's an ok job if you are in between jobs or you really need a job at that moment. I would not suggest that you make it a long term choice. They are good at hiring a lot of people especially during spring time.
good,"I go in to work in the morning or evening .love working with customers. I have learned many thing about kitchens and bathroom renovictions "
good,"due to the commercialism in america, the retail industry is almost breaking workers down for only minimum wage, Lowe's seems to increase this problem exponentially."
good,Job role has changed twice in less than two years without warning or explanation.  Very high turnover and unhappy staff.  Leadership doesn't share any information that affects your life until too late.
good,When I interviewed for the job was told it would be full time. When I started work was informed that it was only part time. Was told that I would be getting 40 hrs per week any way. After one week hr was cut to 26 hrs per week. Several week later was hired full time then after two weeks hrs was cut to part time. Never know what week schedule will be.
good,"The pay is alright, it‚Äôs one of the highest paying jobs in the company without being a manager. The benefits are great and you will get your 40 hours in a week a minimum and a bunch of overtime. However there are a few things you‚Äôll need to know if you‚Äôre getting hired as a Non-CDL driver. "
good,Not a bad place to work. The people are friendly. Great work environment with the employees and customers. Makes people want to come to work and leave with a smile
good,"I worked at the Lowe`s in Goodyear for 5 years. The store was frequently under staffed, this made accomplishing daily tasks challenging. I enjoyed helping customers trouble shoot home repair jobs. Giving them the confidence to DIY. I found my fellow workers to be friendly and helpful."
good,"They typical day of a store level AP Manager is more mundane than true asset protection work should be. Most of your day is spent counting inventory because someone said something wasn't there the day before or there was more product than there should have been multiplied by 200 items and that is your day. Counting. Not catching crooks, preventing ""true"" shrink but counting items. For the job the pay is decent if not overly fair but it's still not true loss prevention or asset protection. In my old district #811 in southeast Virginia the AP team is NOT ALLOWED to catch shoplifters...period...at all...not even a little bit. They have to let the loss happen and then file a police report AFTER getting permission from the District AP Manager who has to get permission from the Regional AP Manager because no one is allowed to make a decision without taking a partner first. Then the store AP manager has to create an email, include video and still frame images, itemized details of what was stolen and send it all to that DAPM. By the time law enforcement is involved in the process literally HOURS or DAYS have passed from the time of the incident. There are other more mundane job responsibilities such as conducting a monthly safety meeting that most in the store management role don't give two hoots about so your store support and engagement level will be pretty low. There are all the usual perks that you see on LINKEDIN such as ""service stars"" awarded to high performing associates but there are equally more given out just for showing up to work and doing the job you are paid to do so"
good,"If you love the hardware/home improvement life and are willing to share that feeling with others, work here. Just make sure you're fit for the bill, as it is very taxing in both physical and mental aspects."
good,Not a bad place to work. No room for advancement. It was a typical retail store environment.  The only advancement is management or sales of which neither really interested me.
good,"Great in the beginning..."
good,Profit driven culture seeking to utilize salaried individuals to the fullest extent.  It's not uncommon to have hourly employees grossing more than salaried employees due to Overtime.
good,"There are a lot of people who work at Lowe's simply because they cannot get jobs elsewhere. I appreciated their employment, but I am overqualified for the job. If you want a good entry level job, then Lowe's is fine."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, but the corporate side sucked, and it was still retail. I liked getting to do a variety of things, because it was tiring and repetitive to be on a register all day."
good,The managers at lowes do not care about the employees there only worried about themselves and what makes them look good I was going through a divorce and was very mentally stressed out my manager and the hr girl did not care about any of it and let me go because I was missing time while I was dealing with my divorce
good,Management only care about themselves not three staff. The store manager is the only one that cares. Most of the managers didn't know what they were doing as a leader.
good,The atmosphere varies from one store to another; clientele make a huge difference to the stress level as do quality of employees.  New changes from corporate have contributed to lack of customer satisfaction and low esteem from Lowe's employees.  Management does not respect employees and do not value employees.
good,"The current atmosphere is one of fear and negative reinforcement.  The managers all fear for their jobs because the VPs fear for their jobs.  So in turn, the associates on the floor are met with substandard expectations and fool-hearty goals."
good,Lowe's could be a more professional company if it were to pay a living wage to it's employees.  This would give incentive to actual professionals to work there.  I was frustrated there as an employee and I continue to be frustrated as a customer.  Home depot seems to do a little better with selection of professionals they place in the store.
good,"The people on the floor in the red vests are, for the most part, dedicated and do care about their jobs and making the customer happy. The people in the offices couldn't care less."
good,Understaffed bad environment  negative  trying to get rid all long time employees  cutting eliminating jobs just cut costs  no concern or loyalty  No HR  department in store
good,"Too many changes in management, schedule changes often, very low moral. No direction or details on what is going on. No communication between corporate and store level."
good,It went from the best job ever to a nightmare and finally I had enough of the stress and resigned my position. I don't typically speak negatively of the store itself bc I have many good friends and I would do nothing that disparages their hard work and I had management that jumped in on whatever needed to be done
good,The pay was unsuitable for the cost of living i had to endure and my store was #1 in the area. we got a meager bonus while the company made extra millions from our store. Instead they are cutting back on hours and benefits. Not turning out great for employees here any more.
good,Absolutely no work life balance. The excessive demands from corporate makes it difficult to do your job. Demands from corporate trickles down to making it difficult to get along with general manager (always stressed and in bad mood).  This management role needs to be simplified!
good,"It's not a terrible job. Competitive pay. Decent hours, sometimes. New company policy makes it hard for part timers to get hours. Full timers work almost 6 days a week 9 hours a day. Get one Saturday off every 2 months. No unpaid days off will be approved so you have to use vacation or sick time. If you're a part timer or new employee expect no days requested for a long time"
good,"Not a lot of good to say at this time. The company is in the process of making more changes,not associate friendly. This would be the reason for looking at other possibilities."
good,The GM are never in the store but make over 6 figures. Never met my Gm and worked there a year. You won‚Äôt move up less someone steps down or leaves. Any team meetings they hold at 530/6am which is ridiculous. New cashiers is a sink or swim environment
good,Loved the customers. Staffing was often minimal creating problems trying to take care of customers in evenings especially. On your feet the whole day .
good,Lowe's is a great place to work if you are motivated to advance within a company.  Lowe's does not treat their employees very well if it is just a part time job.
good,"Customers are always looking for a discount, so you have to know how place works before letting the customer know. It's a fairly easy job. One of the better paid part time jobs I've had to pay bills through school. They don't like to work with you as well as they say."
good,A typical day at work is usually chaos. Management is always changing. People are always quitting. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customer.
good,"A lot of changes are occurring at Lowes. When all the dust settles, it may be a very good place to work. At present, all of the changes reflecting the morphing of the retail environment is reflected in wavering morale.  Middle management is trying hard, for the most part."
good,"Lowe's is bringing in managers that are not a good fit for the Lowe's I started with. They are trying turn us into Home Depot and I hate it..current store manager just sits in his office and puts all the work on the asm's.  We are working 65-70 hours a week, no home/work life balance."
good,"This is your typical retail type job. They will work you and work you everyday you are there. They don't like overtime unless it benefits the company, so asking for more hours is tough but they are more than willing to keep you if the store needs you but only when they need you not when you need more hours."
good,"I have found that this company is going though a lot of changes and the safest position is a cashier. Feel free to apply to other positions, but don't be surprised if they change something."
good,"I enjoyed the work that I did at Lowe's, but I had mangers throwing objects at us when they got upset or did not respect the time off we needed. I felt appropriately paid for the work I did and I did enjoy most of the lower level managers and my co-workers."
good,"The benefits and pay was good.  I even advanced quickly which was nice. They helped work out some vacation stuff for me too which was great.  The job was AWESOME, up until the new CEOMarvin Ellison took over.  Things became tense, political and scary.  You never knew if you were going to  lose your job for silly reasons; I saw a lot of people that went through that.  It was sad.  I definitely don‚Äôt recommend working there unless your a student that can be part time or you absolutely need too.  My advice would be don‚Äôt say to much.  they‚Äôll write you up for anything now with the intention to fire you or just to  intimidate you.  Good luck."
good,"The front end was always under staffed so as the front end manager I was basically playing every role on the front end to get through the day. Long hours, not many breaks, but the people who worked with you were great to commiserate with."
good,The new Company CEO what was the former CEO at JCPenney  He's trying to morph Lowe's into Home Depot. Which might not a bad thing since the stock value of Home Depot is twice that of Lowe's. But walking people out the door with no notice that have been with this company for over 20 years is treacherous. All in order to cut salaries. Think about that.
good,If you want to work there then go for it. It‚Äôs a fun job to have. I mean I guess it really depends on the location of the Lowe‚Äôs you are applying for.
good,"As a Delivery Driver the days were long and physically demanding. "
good,"Low pay for experienced workers."
good,Overall good place to work. Amazing associates but managers have a lot of problems. They claim to promote within but rarely do so. The hour cutting and random schedule changes make home/work life exhausting and stressful.
good,"It can be a fun place to work, you can easliy learn a lot of things if they have the right tools their workers. The good thing about working at lowes is that you get to interact with a lot different people learn new tips and tricks that can help you outside of work."
good,When I first started fun job and enjoyed it. Changed so much and massive company layoffs. Management is always trying to micro manage a position that doesn't require it.
good,Overall I believe that Lowe‚Äôs is a decent company to work for or do business with. Corporate has made some changes since I started that I absolutely do not agree with. People that have been there 15+ years just up and lost their jobs with no warning due to the CEO deciding to hire through a third party for certain positions. And at my particular location there are some issues with management that seem to never get fixed.
good,I left because the corporate office decided to change the availability schedule to seven days a week for part time. Meaning that when the distribution center decided to send trucks is when we would be scheduled. This being my part time job i wasn't risking working 12-19 days in a row without a day off on someone else's decision.
good,"if you have nowhere else to go. I was at the end of my rope, and they gave me a job. Like all retail jobs, they keep asking for more and more, and they will take everything you can give. But you don't receive a living wage. No overtime allowed. Not enough people to get the job done, and there are at least six hours a day where there are only a couple of people doing any work. Everyone else is expected to walk around looking for customers to help, even when there are none."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 4am, and I am on the clock at 6am, till 3pm. Fast paced, and good team effort on the front end.   Enjoy talking with coworkers, and feeling like a family. Hardest part of the job is running Customer Service alone, trying to answer the phone and direct calls while simultaneously waiting on customers; processing returns, etc. "
good,When first hired they say if there is anything wrong with your schedule they will fix it but when it comes down to it management always denies your request for scheduling change and then they act passive-aggressive when you take holiday or vacation time but the job is easy but it is mentally stressful management also picks favorites that is not based on work performance
good,"Worked with some great people to include some of the managers, Managers have their favorites and the pay raises are not great . The work can be repetitive but I enjoyed working with and helping customers with their projects"
good,"Lowe's has a very high turnover rate depending on the store and location. Unfortunately for my store, the quality of candidates is lacking. The employee's we do hire are unmotivated and lazy which creates a horrible work culture and customer service that is almost nonexistent."
good,"Everyone is very welcoming, although some managers are a bit creepy. Most if not all my coworkers are agreeable and the energy us always friendly. However, some people misuse their standing."
good,Absolutely no reliable hours or schedule.  Lowes Corporation talks the talk but they do NOT treat their people fairly and everyone is clearly very dispensable.  Unless you are in management you will not be able to depend on your income or work schedule.  You may be required to go to work at 4AM or you may be required to work until 10-11PM.
good,"I worked there for 11+ years and my position was ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù,,, several others were too,,,moral is very low in the store as a result. Too many chiefs and not enough injuns as they say"
good,I am a overnight stocker. I was taught how to unloaded the truck and when the pallets are out on the floor we are to put all the merchandise on the shelves.
good,As seasonal worker . there stipulations as for attendance before they advance you to part time or any position. Even if u have a avoid reason for veing late they dont give a verbal counsel .
good,My day starts by putting freight away. Checking out front of the store to see what lawn tractors need to be restock. The same check on the grills. Checking on the tells inside the store. Then get started on assembling
good,Really have nothing to say about the company. Nothing productive to say. The company needs to become more main stream with ordering of product and management needs to be on the same page among them self.
good,I honestly had a great time working with my former co-workers and some of the higher management. When I worked for them depending on the day it was great on other days it was a nightmare to be working. I didn't really mind working with them but they could use some improvement in some of the things they do.
good,The people I worked with decided early on for some reason that they did not like me - just didn't fit in - and they made life extremely difficult and eventually fired me despite good numbers.
good,Management is sometimes rude. Coworkers are lazy and management doesn‚Äôt do anything about it until it affects them. Low pay and boring environment. The managers play favorites
good,"I feel like if you want to be a family type of business then work with the employees to do a schedule that lets ones off to go to church.  Family time is not available to the ones that need it.  Having a straight shift for days, or evenings should be available for you to have a steady routine.  This also causes health issues due to stress.  They expect to be perfect but aren‚Äôt willing to change."
good,Really enjoyed working at lowes in the beginning now with the constant personnel and job descriptions changes not a happy place at all you can see it in the associates attitudes.Not a good place to work if you have a family with the scheduling you never get to see them.
good,Lowes is not the best company to work for. They are making a lot of changes with in the company and the stores. The kitchen design position is changing and becoming more of a retail position.
good,"Lowe's in Mount Holly is a good place to work for a job in retail. If you are really committed, there is some opportunity to move up. Unfortunately, like many retail jobs, they try to run the store on a ""skeleton"" crew and this makes it very difficult for employees to do their job."
good,The customer and (non mgmt) coworker environment was wonderful. However the corporate to management culture caused many employees to quit as soon as something better came along. It wasn't an environment  (in that regard) that fostered advancement nor engagement of hourly employees.
good,Good first time job. There are opportunities to grow long term if you are single. They are flexible with scheduling around school. You are able to move around departments to better understand the over processes of the store and better service the customers.
good,Don‚Äôt trust the people you work with . It‚Äôs all about stepping on temps and mangers  give the god jobs to there favs . Loaded in Trails in the heat and it‚Äôs all about Lowe‚Äôs . Make them the money
good,From my experience Lowes has poor management and during my time i have worked at several stores and noticed the buddy system is in full force at most locations.
good,"There are an array of areas to work and learn within the company, which I shall possess and grow from.  The company has great health benefits and 401k. As for there wages, after one reaches a certain salary, one no longer receives raises, unless becoming a Specialist or Manager. If you are a student, it is a great place to start as a part timer.  Yet, there are many changes evolving within the company."
good,"In the long run I really liked at first. The first manager was very hands on. The last 2 not so much. First one made it a joy to come in. The first crew was really nice and felt like family,"
good,"be prepared to handle most things alone, including situations that are not only above your pay grade, but out of your jurisdiction, in general.  no coverage, terrible scheduling, good people."
good,"Was a fun place to work when I first started. Too many changes with staff, especially with floor and dept managers. Never enough staff for assisting or checking out customers. Never cared for OSLG cashiers who had to endure the heat in Florida. Should have been a rotation every two hours during shift. Compensation was ridiculous, in 3years my increase was only $0.76. Because I changed positions before my annual increase I had to wait a full year to only receive $0.36. I am not praising myself, however I rarely called out and worked hard during my shift. Nobody is held accountable to do their jobs."
good,"Management didn't staff enough people to cover the busy times and therefore work didn't get completed and made employees rush jobs, stop stocking, which left hazards in the aisles to take care of customers or go help another department that was overwhelmed."
good,"not fair to older employees wanting to advance. change your work days to often.  needs to work with the employees more "
good,"Overall not a bad job, learned a lot. Management didn't really know how to run the store or depts. which made things difficult. Good company to work for unless you want to make money in a non-management position. Got less than $1 total worth of raises over a 2 year period."
good,"I‚Äôve been with Lowe‚Äôs since 2013 and have had 3 separate store managers that have had very noticeable flaws. The first one was great as far as the business aspect side of the company but his people skills absolutely sucked. The second manager was greedy and selfish to say the least, which actually caught up to him and ended with his termination. The third and current manager is a great people person but lacks the drive and assertiveness that a manager should have. It trickles down to all lower level management and gives the store the bad morale and chaotic work environment it currently has. The term ‚Äútoo many chiefs not enough Indians‚Äù is the best way to sum it up. Although still the company is great just my store is lacking the proper ideals to follow the company‚Äôs mission."
good,"Great if you have no other option. You can be late and call in quite often and they'll tolerate it because they simply need warm bodies. If you're totally financially sunk and you just need a JOB they will probably hire you at $12/hr just be persistent. Most everyone there is working Lowes as a ""side job"" for the heck of it / to get their SSI / because the hours can be flexible. The ""lifers"" / people who've worked there for more than 10 years are usually  emotionally stunted failures of human beings. They look visibly crushed and all mumble inaudibly (I'm dead serious, it's very strange). "
good,I started off on loading the truck Freight team as soon after moved to receiving clerk held that position for 6 months before transferring to Lumber full-time also was promoted to Pro service desk but the pay was not competitive yet better than Home Depot
good,"As a part-time weekend customer service team member I simply wondered around responding to radio calls to assist customers in any area. It was enjoyable to help people and talk to them. "
good,It's not about how good you work it's about who you know. Management at the time was very messy and unprofessional . Favoritism at is best and half trained employees.
good,"Unfortunately I took this position based off of a job description that changed 6 weeks into the job, thanks to corporate restructuring by outsourcing the store level HR department."
good,"managers are bias towards employees they like and are friends with"
good,"At the time I really loved my job, I worked at the commercial desk helping the commercial sales team, I was classes as part time with no benefits, though I worked full time hours every week. I like the management team for most departments, they knew their jobs and did them well."
good,You have NO control of your hours and they dont CARE if it affects your family.You dont like the change they quit fool...thats the attitude since the new CEO got in.
good,"Great Company to be apart of although some locations might have customer service and mangment"
good,Hade a great time while there never a sour moment most of the time I enjoyed my time there not to much to much I can say I left for my reasons but it's time for better things
good,The work environment at Lowe's was not always positive. Negative co-workers in other departments would bring people down. The pay is ok but honestly for the high volume of calls received it is unfair.
good,As long as your able to keep up with the workload you should be able to make.... there is basically no room for advancement though so don‚Äôt expect handouts
good,Isnt a bad place to work until they tell you that you've topped out in your position after you take said position. Management's communication skills are lacking a bit.
good,"I used to enjoy working there but changes and management went to the bad"
good,I worked with some great people and had good managers. I was not micromanaged and was given the ability to do my job with minimal interference. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and making their day.
good,This is good for a first job but isn't great for much more. Management is not the greatest and advancements are few and far between. Employees are underappreciated.
good,From all the locations I worked at 3. Management is usually great accept for west wichita Lowe's location in kansas. HR will work with you on any problems that you might have
good,"Part time, part time, part time, lots of hours, no hours. That is a typical month. Some of the management is great, others you wonder if they are still working there. The rules change depending on who is there and what customer is complaining. There is no training other than what you learn on the computer, and if they need you to work because 20 people called out for a football game then it's sink or swim. Bonuses? yup, we hear all the time about management getting bonuses, how do they do that? By cutting the sales floor, by providing horrible customer service and they when the customer sends in a bad review, who gets called into the office, yup, the CSA that was on the floor that day drowning. But as they say, that's retail."
good,It's ok if your starting out. I wouldn't try to make a career out of this job. It's your stereo typical retail place with a few things just a bit different than say Walmart. If you've ever been there or any retail establishment you know what your getting into.
good,The company is very unorganized when it comes to customer service.  There is not enough staffing so you have to do your job plus other people jobs and you get disciplined for not being in your area because you have to cover for the understaffing. It‚Äôs really just hard to advance when you work in a toxic environment .
good,Lowes isnt a bad place to work I ran into an issue with management when i had a surgery the forced me to miss work so i told my manager and there was a miscommunication which lead me to losing my job.
good,"It's a forever changing environment. They don't seem to appreciate people  who work hard. Other people who are not energized to do the best job they can are discouraging to others.The upside is you get to help customers with their projects and meet many nice people. I also got to learn about other departments.I worked in the Millwork department and learned a lot about doors and windows.,I worked in other departments and learned a lot more."
good,It‚Äôs a job. Scheduling can be better for family time.  Excellent benefits with healthcare.  The company could use a better management system. Needs more of a open door policy to file complaints or set of issues.
good,"management was a mess, lazy employees got by without any repercussions, hours sucked. only thing good were some of the other employees and pto. good benefits."
good,"Management at Keizer Lowe's does not communicate well with staff on any level with few exceptions.  Across the board, there is simply too much negativity, overt stress, impatience, rudeness, and criticism with inconsistent guidance and direction.  It's not uncommon for employees to be given directly contradictory instructions by different managers or even the same manager within the same day or even the same hour.  There's quite a bit of turnover due to the workplace culture of stress and disrespect of others.  Understaffing is also a huge problem with employees regularly being tasked with more work than they can reasonably manage."
good,Lowes is now changing into Home Depot.  They have decided that the employees only need one weekend off every 8 weeks.  No one is happy about this change.
good,"they are far too corporately structured. if you don't do exactly what they want you're fired. if you have an individualistic attitude you're fired. the managers form cliques and don't communicate with each other. one manager may ask you to do one thing and some other manager will ask you to do something else that conflicts with the other managers request, and when one or both tasks aren't done, you're the one in trouble, not the managers who don't communicate with each other and give you conflicting orders"
good,Dont like that my position I applied for was Fulltime at great pay when I first started and then a month later found out I was parttime and pay was less then I was told. So now hours are being half cause of the new schedule system.  Dont like that i was lied to and now have to deal with it til I get something fulltime.
good,"I was hired at Lowes to be an Internet Puller for online orders. The computer system is archaic. I only pulled one order. Was trained to be a cashier and worked mostly at  the self check out , boring. They asked if I would be Credit Rover for more pay. I walked the store looking for customers who wanted a Lowes Credit Card. Terrible job. Walked up to 18,000 steps a day on concrete floors, Thursday through Sunday as those are the busiest times. Got to work with some nice people but they all seemed unhappy there. The pay was good as they determine it by past experience and education. I quit and shortly after they did away with the Credit Rover position."
good,Good and bad. Good ole boy system at its finest. I have nothing more too say this has nothing to do with my resume okay just a few more words to go.oh almost
good,"As a member of leadership, our new CEO has made a lot of changes which our employees are very uncomfortable with. There are a lot of new systems, designed to save time, but are actually time suckers (WIRE)"
good,The employees make or break the job experience in my opinion and honestly if it weren't for some of my coworkers i dont know how my experience would be
good,"Managers suck, they will always have trouble with scheduling and would even make you work on days you aren‚Äôt able to, lack of communication and no proper training given."
good,"Hours are all over the place, does not allow you to have much of a life outside of work. the new CEO has created a lot of changes as well, I believe it is in a negative direction."
good,always understaffed and the coworkers and management are lazy. most managers will hand off customers to other people or say to find someone else to help either due to just pure laziness or lack of knowledge.
good,You will not get rich. Sometimes the hrs. are inconsistent.  There is lots of staff turnover.  It is not a job for thin skinned people.  You have to have a filter.
good,COMPANY HAD REALLY GOOD BENEFITS. NO RAISES AFTER YOU TOPPED OUT IN YOUR JOB CODE. Worked with great people but management was uncaring and never available to deal with issues.
good,"Daily work included the sales floor which included the hardware and appliances. I was salary and was expected to stay when people where out or late. The system for my type of work was 20/20 cad. I mainly developed kitchens, counter tops and related items.I was trained and work at the register when needed. Management really wasn't helpful as they were busy on the quotas."
good,"long time ago...may be not as today"
good,"The store I was at was terrible ( I-10 Belt line), shoplifters, dirty, management was over his head, and the type of customers was terrible. "
good,It really depends on which store you are working in and what managers you are working for. When I first started the managers were awesome and wanted you to better yourself.  When I had to relocate the managers there didn't care and made it hard to even want to come into work.
good,Lowes is OK. Alot of work and not much pay. Management was not good and if you worked the front counter you were pushed and yelled at a lot.Not worth it for me.
good,"Got the job for the flexible hours they offered. Was in nursing school. Consistently, booked me for hours I was marked as unavailable every single week I worked there. "
good,Company has great potential however new programs are constantly launched last minute. Communication takes way too long to make it down the chain to lower managment to provide execution at an attainable level.
good,"harder work schedule starting in 2019. New changes coming for "
good,Good company. Hardworking associates.  Hours for this kind of employment are not always conducive to a great work/life balance.  Working conditions are good and overall benefits package are standard.
good,"Constant battle for IT systems to function correctly."
good,The Main Issue With This Company And Im Sure In Most Of The Stores Around The Country Is Customers Are Always Complaining Where Are The Employees To HELP Us?????
good,"Management is inconsistent, no hr  and nobody listens, hr doesn‚Äôt do anything , one doesn‚Äôt know where to go for advice , not being able to live up to your potential, don‚Äôt value its assocates"
good,"When I first started working for Lowe's, I loved it. My co-workers became my family, including management. I could confide in my immediate supervisor about anything. Over a period of time and many store managers later everything changed. The morale of the employees was way down. I couldn't trust anyone especially management. My health started to deteriorate so I had to stop working for awhile."
good,One minute they tell you they're not gonna cut hours and the next minute they're cutting your hours. Then they expect one person to run 2+ departments. Then your yearly review/raise isn't even 50 cents.
good,The company is a fast past job in which management is so hung up with stuff that half the time you have to figure out what exactly your job for the day is because nothing is the same.
good,"Management is terrible! The sales managers are like children who pass off every task and problem to either assistant managers or specialists. You also get treated like a child and spoken to like one. They don‚Äôt care about you or how you contribute to the company. You are just a body to them. Someone to fill a space. If they don‚Äôt like you or if you are replaceable, they will get rid of you. If you are one of the ones that they depend on, they will ride you so hard to the point of breaking. There is favoritism and some managers will tell you that your schedule is based on the needs of the business. Don‚Äôt think you will have a work/life balance. You won‚Äôt. You will never be able to plan events or activities because your schedule changes constantly. If you have management experience, don‚Äôt think you will become a manager here. If you don‚Äôt interview well, no matter how hard you have worked and how long you have been with the company, it won‚Äôt matter! Everything Lowes does mimics Home Depot. If HD changes their hours, Lowes changes theirs. If Home Depot changes their management structure, so does Lowes. Lowes is so far stuck up Home Depot‚Äôs butt they can‚Äôt see straight. Sales and good surveys are all that maters for this company. If you‚Äôre a woman, be prepared to get sexually haerassed by customers, abused, and mistreated."
good,"The hours, the pay, and benefits are ok.. I get in quick and Im out at a good time. We have a 3 man team but the room for improvement and development is little at my store because our managers show favoritism to certain employees. The managers pick and choose who they want to speak to and associate with."
good,although i work with them for over ten yrs when there is re structure for company the oldest and most paid get cut. it is there lost for keeping well establish associate and only look at them as dollar sigh.
good,"assist customers with needs cashier, gathered  baskets assist with taking out grocery's to car. as a stoker . stock shelves with product as needed. face grocery. fill produce as needed organize dairy."
good,"Training is brief and not all emcompassing.  Best to get right on the floor and start to learn area.  I have learned a lot of customer service skills, how to handle bad and good customers.  Hours seem random but follow a matrix scheduling program which has you work days, mids and nights.  Once a month you are required to work six days in a row which is difficult because days off are not in a row.  Also only one weekend in a row off is hard to deal with.This may be the hardest part of the job to deal with.  Things are always changing, Department managers were cut, HR folks were cut, rules regarding absenses constantly change. I enjoyed the people I worked with and some of them have become friends."
good,"its a good company to work for! benefits are really amazing, being able to transfer to a different store when wanting to relocate is another plus! Kind of stressful but thats ok"
good,At Lowe's you learn how to help customers buy what they need to complete there home improvement project. They teach you how to learn the product that you are selling. The best part for me is when the customers come back and ask for you to help them because they trust the help you gave them from before.
good,"It is easy job to learn, but they put extra work on their good employee. Also they let a lot of the men walk about why they have a women do most of the outside lifting."
good,"The managers are not concerned about anything but their status. They don't keep their team moving forward. The daytime work is put off all day then passed off to the overnight stocking team when we have our own job to do. Then when we don't get the daytime stuff dinne by the end of our shift, it's our fault."
good,"Lowe's maintains itself as a modern standard of retail sales focused on home improvement. It's goals, products, and accessibility are sound, but the infrastructure continues to erode. In-store technology is incredibly outdated or poorly designed. Staffing is at a functional minimum. Training, praise, and consideration are sparse, if even existent.  "
good,To me the job was just a learning experience. It was a job to get by in high school. Now out of high school it was drama filled and unhealthy working environment.
good,Lowe's is going through a lot of changes and it makes job security unpredictable. They may be a good place to work in a couple years but right now lowe's is unstable.
good,"The managerment staff for oer night need more training,as a black I took to heart that the manager stayed he was a slave driver.other then that the coworker was great."
good,"Customer focus is primary goal of working at Lowes Home Improvement. Working at Lowes for many years gave me alot of great friends but on the same token, you are still only a number."
good,lowes has good benefits and discounts for your home. Job is not hard logical thinking and making customer happy. keeping area clean. Learn alot about houses even if you dont know one.
good,Never enough staff to help customers.  Always short handed.  Management never available to help.  Always want u to work harder and harder  with no help
good,"its a easy job but there have been alot of cuts to personnel lately and the managers are pushing alot more work on the good employee's, and does nothing about the lazy employee's that get away with everything."
good,"Cashier work here is unprofessional. When it comes to certain head cashiers they're immature, and petty. The only way you move up is if your basically a suck up."
good,"i would start work , usually with a customer waiting.  some of the customers would complain that lowes didn't have all the items that some of the other  home improvement stores have. i learned more  about home improvement, that is; knowledge of basic electrical wiring, plumbing and hardware. management was mediocre; sometimes reluctant  to assist me expecting to know things i was never shown. i would rely on other employees to help me because the had been there for years. the most enjoyable part of the job was the colleagues that i worked with. the one thing i did like was the rate of pay was o.k., not as good as being in the union local 705."
good,They recently laid off some employees and have not hired anymore.  The managers have problems getting all employees to work as a team. They do not promote within as far as I knew.  They maid promises and they did not keep them.
good,"The money was cool, the job was decent. It wasn‚Äôt really much to gain from working at Lowe‚Äôs. They do let you have opportunities to work forwards getting equipment licenses"
good,"Full time employees, which are few throughout the store, receive the best benefit packages and schedules.  Part time employees get 1 week paid vacation per year, zero sick days.  Part time employees are used to fill in around the full time employee schedules, but will usually work full time hours without the benefits during most of the year.  The corporation will cut hours in the off season to eliminate the legal mandatory full time recognition.   Forget family time, the inconsistent shift schedules will have you at the store doing back to back shifts, or working several days in a row.    Forget having holidays off, except thanksgiving day and Christmas day.   Strict attendance policy, especially for part time employees, as you can be replaced."
good,"Lowe's is just a typical big box retailer; lots of employees, high turnover, disconnected corporate management, store leadership that is woefully unprepared for their roles, and about 50/50 mix of knowledgeable veterans and people that are just there to stock shelves.  Just like other big box retailers, it's tolerable for a couple of years and then it just starts to get old and you're looking to go somewhere else."
good,"This job is decent for people still in school, as the hours are flexible and they are willing to accommodate school schedule as well.  Sometimes they will tell me to do so many different things all at once, which is really difficult especially if the store is busy and there are customers waiting for me to assist them.  It can be stressful at times."
good,This job was very stressful.  My manager at that time was very difficult to work for.  The company had good intentions but management in my location made it very hard for me to do my job.
good,"The managment is very poor for half of the management there, alot like to try and act as if there helpful but become back stabbing. When wver trying to get communication with mangment it became a hassel due to them pawning them off on others."
good,"Great money, poor work life balance. Inconsistent leadership and standards from market to market. As the company streamlines, corporate execs.  who are being phased out are being slotted into field positions such as District Managers thereby lessening the positions for those that have been in the field. Lack of upward mobility for field leadership."
good,"I was well compensated for my position, both in terms of hourly pay and benefits, but there was almost no room for advancement. It became evident that I was in a dead-end job and not building a lasting career."
good,"My time at Lowe's was short. I was signed on as ""seasonal,"" but the job was even shorter than that. Due to the store making less revenue than expected, several workers were let go, starting with the most recent hires (me)."
good,"One of the biggest problems we had was there weren't enough people to be trained for certain services. I worked in the lumber department, so there were often people who bought entire pallets of concrete or bundles of wood. Training for the forklift is optional but when you need a driver, that becomes a problem."
good,"I would not recommend this company due to the lack of advancement and the way management treated their employees. "
good,"Its retail so it is not high paying."
good,"on a typical day when going into work, we didn't know what truck we were going to use. Trucks would usually break down. Managers are unorganized at assigning out deliveries."
good,"Lack of support from management. A lot of favoritism within the store.   Learn to work independently because you can not rely on others. If you like to work alone and customer service, this will be the best place to work."
good,"they don't adequately explain to you what you job is, write you up for doing something wrong, but can't show you anything that tells you that it is wrong"
good,"Make no mistake working in retail is going to be a hassle, but working as an unloader for Lowe's takes the cake. Besides breaking your back unloading a truck they make sure that you do everything else in the store apart from being a cashier. They constantly tried to control how you put away freight and was on you about making sure you got to every customer."
good,"poor middle management and lack of communication. work advancement is only possible if you are friendly with management, it feels like working in a high school"
good,Good place if you're looking for a sales job. The support positions and administrative positions are slowly all being eliminated by corporate. The company is eliminating all positions that are not solely a customer-facing position. I would only recommend Lowes to those who are interested in sales and customer service.
good,"Find out what best deparment to suit you, therefore the job goes a little bit more easily, the products and task don't become like such a test, try out the receiving team a bit more elite as far as physical work, and sometimes paperwork."
good,Hours don't allow for much family life. The main reason for leaving. Commute was extremely long. Not much time off during the holidays or on weekends. Not recommended for family people.
good,Management is usually unprofessional. Poorly run with regard to management making sure that associates are doing their jobs as any good management team would be doing.
good,Lowe's is a small company but family oriented as the staff act like family and not co-workers and work closely together. Overall I do not have anything negative to say about the company; I just have other financial needs they were not able to meet eventually.
good,Lowe's benefits are good.  They give their employees a certain level of autonomy.  Management is still in the dark about what the company's vision is.
good,"Should only work there if you are advancing yourself, i.e. colle, tech school.  They are understaffed and management is unresponsive to employee needs"
good,"management is not loyal to employees, only customers."
good,horrible scheduling.   Closings and openings back to back   Constantly understaffed.  Cut payroll every fall to increase their bonuses for having a low payroll at the end of the year.
good,"Company and job have potential to be great and a fun environment, but it's not there yet. Being a middle management type position there is more responsibility then pay provided."
good,"I worked over 2000 hours extra in one year and my manager said to me, ""Is that all you have to give""."
good,"was good for the most part, but hours were not really good for those with varying schedules, and was very hard to find people that were there to help or knew there store well."
good,If you like retail then this is the place to work. There are chances to advance if you stay with the company long enough. If you don't like customer service then Lowes is not the place for you. There are alot of training opportunities also.
good,"Lowes is as reliable job as you make it. Show up and you have a job."
good,"A typical day at work can start at 7am to 12 noon and can be 4 to 8 hours. If you start at 7am you have to do "
good,Management is terrible. You can request days off a month or more in advance and they won‚Äôt review it until a week prior after being constantly reminded then deny it because they took too long. ASMs and SM are all over bearing and never communicate. You will constantly find yourself doing the same things over again in different ways to appease each different manager. Coworkers make it bearable to an extent but wouldn‚Äôt recommend working here
good,If you are too valuable in an area they will not advance you through the company. They don't pay well and will expect more. but they are making some changes for the new people but still pay the old people poorly.
good,"If you are looking for a job that will get you by and you could make friends at. Lowes might be an option for you,  just be careful of toxic management"
good,"Management does not stand behind employees, hr manager is very non professional, if you let her know about an issue she will tell who reported it and then do nothing about it."
good,Fun workplace and amazing employees to work with but the management was sorely lacking in all areas. Customer service was great as were the employee to employee working relationships. Main problem with Lowe's was job security and chance for advancement.
good,"management is not up to par."
good,Company management is strictly bottom line driven.  Feels employees are just another tool to reach bottom line.  Very low employee moral.  This really only reflects on this location and management team.  Have worked at other location that have much better working environment.
good,"Lowe's is a large company trying to go in the right direction but they don't know what that is at this time. They are 20 years behind in technology which hurts service and productivity. Overall leadership is strong and pro employee. They want to be a great place to work without paying to get top recruits which is hard to accomplish. They are a typical retail environment which requires managers to work 55 hours a week and almost all weekends which makes it hard to higher and keep employees with strong family values. Overall, a good place to work for single people starting out it the work force."
good,The workplace can be fun and interesting it all depends on the management. During prime hours managers are difficult to find when needed and coworkers have lack of motivation.
good,"every day busy , little personal for customer service , is dificult get a promotion , or other benefit"
good,when I first started there it was a good place to work but as time went on it became harder to keep people happy you were always short staffed and had tons of work to do with only a few of my fellow worker willing to work hard to get the job done it became very stressfull working there
good,"If the management at the store was better it would have been decent. Theres really not much else to say, the store is just ran horribly I wouldn't apply again."
good,"I quit Lowe‚Äôs Grocery Store , because the manager was being really rude and disrespectful. Everyday each employee had to sell a certain amount of items to the food drive , well it was my first time there so not many people were buying them. The manager pulled me into the office and talked to me in a rudely mannerly way."
good,"I worked here temporarily. The team are so helpful, work is not really hard. Except that your work schedule (time and day) keeps on changing every week."
good,"need better managers who actualy cared about the employees"
good,"If your going to school and need some extra spending cash, this was a fairly relaxed environment. Run of the mill, hardware store experience. Did learn a lot though."
good,Lowe's is a good job to work at while going to school or for 6 months to a year. Other than that there is a lot of stress while working there and sometimes can be overwhelming when it does not have to be simply because there is so much to do and not enough staff to do everything.
good,Lowes is a good company. However it is not a great one. Like most companies there is a lot of room for improvement. Lowes should hire from within its own building before outsiders. Lowes should also be strict about coverage and actually help and work together when there are cuts or no coverage ----10 years and more than 70% of the time we had no coverage. They should also work on fairness among its work place. People should all be assigned work load not just certain ppl while the others are fanning themselves..... Besides that the pay was always above average if you were a new hire but very low if you were a veteran.
good,"long hours and short pay, was placed on the shipping docks with 72 loading doors, constantly loading and unloading trailers, dangerous work and heavy manual labor."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe‚Äôs. The hours conflicted with my schedule unfortunately. I worked with some good people. Manager was harsh to work for. Made my decision to leave easy.
good,"Grateful for the opportunity to be employed, however the rotating schedule can get old and those who have families and small children tend to miss a lot of there events and school activities. Very micro managed and seems like no trust amongst management and employees."
good,"I've been with this company for 13 years - for the most part it has been good to me.  The ever changing schedules makes having a life apart from the job very difficult.  In that time, very reliable and dependable but there is no recognition for that dedication."
good,"But that's about the best can be said about the Contact Center. This company has been successful, but the work environment is toxic and it appears to go up the food chain a bit. Decisions are made and metrics are enforced with no discussion or buy-in from staff who those decision effect directly. Communication is definitely lacking and often employees are aware of changes until the moment they become policy or process. Leadership is mostly unaware of the needs of the individuals of their own team and focus more on pushing them or threatening them to get their metrics where they should be, often so they qualify for bonuses. The overall atmosphere (like live monitoring calls, activity adherence, etc.) makes the place feel like high school and everyone in a red vests thinks they have to act like parents with unruly children."
good,"Lowes is a good in between job. It doesnt pay well and management is all over the place at some stores.  overall it is okay and easy to work at. "
good,"Certain stores create this high school environment, where instead of being based on morals, work ethics, passion and drive. Its a popularity contest with the store managers being the sole leaders!!!"
good,I was only hired on as seasonal and it is very fast paced. It is enjoyable at times but it is also quite stressful. I prefer a job where i am doing stuff on the computer.
good,It is a very ok job at this point I‚Äôm not going to just write a bad review about this job if you need a job go apply it‚Äôs just really not the job for me anymore
good,"WHen I first started out they encouraged you to take the time needed to get a task done correctly and safely. Towards the end of my employment, they want the job done as fast as possible."
good,"I was a non CDL driver. Work hours are variable. Delivered anything that could be fit in the truck. Relaxed environment, good customer base, contrat customers were great"
good,But its just ok. More often than not it is highschoolers or locals who decided that they just needed a steady job in between looking for other employment.
good,Lowe's over works their employees and doesn't have any great incentives to back up the work load they put on their employees. There aren't many benefits except for management. Even full time employees struggle with their benefits.
good,"I believe that you are required to have accuracy, attention-to detail, communication, efficiency, quick learner, and follower. You have to follow corporate and store manager's protocol. I found that schedule hours were dictated by store hours and management needs. You had to stand on your feet for long hours and to be busy at all times. I think that sales quotas and performance goals were up and above employee growth. Staffing positions and benefits were always being reduced. Employees were expected to work far beyond their title."
good,It's nice but if you're single and are ready for a fasted paced environment. You have no time to yourself outside of work because they demand so much. At work you need to finish a pallet and a half in an hour for 8 hours everyday from 3am to 12 pm.
good,"Working at the front end of the store included dealing with basic transactions, returns, online orders and any other type of customer service. Little to no tasks were given when there was down time."
good,Higher paying retail job for standard employees. The benefits are very good. Some stores are better then others. Managers stretched thin with new structure.
good,a typical day started good depending on what management was on the shift you started on. From that point shifts started to change and there was always one manager that had a problem with the way you did something. the hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the drama that seem to come with the job. from this job i learned that some times you have to learn to deal with the obstacles  that get thrown at you so you can prosper.
good,"Lowe's was fantastic when I first joined as a team member. Once in a lower management position, defining role outlines and training was sadly lacking. The culture seemed to promote shift separation, although this was not the intent. There was an unspoken ""code"" but no official mentorship. While Leadership did it's best to promote change, there was little support for small ideas to develop. (This may be a downside to any large corporation.) Creativity, personal growth and education were given lip service, but not actively encouraged. Bottom line: If you don't mind remaining in the team member positions and only do what you are told, this is a great job! People with creative bents or who need more one-on-one direction at first should beware of the challenges."
good,"cashier, was fun a lot of variety working with people cashier as well as coworkers it was a fun job but tiring on feet all day long and must like working outside, cold temps coming in doors etc.,"
good,"Hard working and low pay , they hire people that don't work and they expect things to get done . But when you are basically that does everything sometimes completing everything isn't possible"
good,"I had a seasonal position assembly gas grils and a few other items. I did like the job because I like to use my hands and tools. the worse thing I did not like Lowes was , I was laid off and no Manager did not give me a week notice of being laid off."
good,"management favored certain teams in the store, disregarded any problems that arose.  put in request to change shifts and they hired someone else and the manager overseeing the department continued to talk down upon his new employee, i was not given an interview for the position.  i was making way too little for the responsibilities our team had. being forced to work overtime."
good,"My time has been short, but have noticed multiple issues with the systems in place. Never enough coverage, which is the customers biggest complaint, and the pay seems low for those with household bills and student loans"
good,"I operated forklift, order picker and reach truck on a daily basis. I was responsible for putting up  daytime freight that came in. check email for worklists. also went on delivery frequently."
good,"Wasn't my favorite place to work but it was a job, job duties were easy, hours were flexible ranging from 6 am to 11 pm, Benefits were good, If I had to I would work for them again."
good,"Typical day starts with putting money in all the registers, than the DSHR which is a store and product safety check.  Than down stocking and IRP which is down stocking product so its available to the customer and IRP's show where there is product missing from the shelf.  I work directly with both employee's and customers on a daily basic's.  Most of my job is problem solving, with employee's and customers."
good,"Low paying job "
good,"I did enjoy working for the first couple of years however, management system is terrible. To much favoritism and back stabing on the job and no confidentiality. I enjoy meeting New and old customers however, companies need to stop ‚úã‚úãsaying the customer is always right. That is definitely not the case at Lowe's. Customers were nasty and rude especially the military customers and their families. Don't get me wrong we had more nice military customers than rude and nasty. However, Corporate and management don't care about there employees and they believed whatever they say right or wrong."
good,"lots of thefts and people barging and running out, very unsafe work environment for a small woman. always felt unsafe or lost, management did nothing but sit and watch."
good,"Lowe's has restructured in that there are no more Department Managers.  The workers that are now hired, mainly through job fairs, make on avg. $2.00 per hour more than employees.  Often, the posted jobs , though applied for by employees, go to outside candidates."
good,it is a lot for one person to do. i learned to depend on your self and work really hard even if no one else is! i will miss a hand full of people but other than that the rest need more training or do not need to work in retail!
good,"The management at this store is bad. He rarely shows up. When he does he criticizes employees in front of customers. People are leaving all the time. 5 people quit last week."
good,"I worked at two stores. Both had pretty lax store and assistant managers."
good,"Honestly the pay and hours were terrible, on a couple occasions they told me to operate  equipment I was not trained to use, you can't go outside the building if your part time so no üö¨ smoke break, or going out to get something to eat at Wendy's luckily there are vending machines. Some of the managers were ok üëå but some were jerks, the owner never even showed up but would leave passive aggressive notes around for us"
good,its not a bad job. you sit around and have to lift heavy items but its not too terrible. i left for health reasons and have even thought about returning.
good,"Management was very bad never enough people working in any department which leads to an overwhelming amount of preventable issues. a typical day as a cashier doesn't involve many things other than cashing in and out people. a typical day at the customer service desk involves returns, price matches, van rentals, delivery dates, online pickups, as well as general customer inquiries and issues. the hardest part of the job for me was the hours they gave 44 hours a week but not including breaks it comes to 40 hours I was paid as part-time staff and didn't get any benefits. the scheduling is not very flexible ex 10-7 12-9 etc. overall the job itself is doable they train you as a cashier but don't train you at the customer service desk they just throw you in."
good,"Lowe's is a great company, they do have some issues with their management staff, Like any company does. The employees at Lowes are lax in their work ethics, management does not work on helping them obtain or coach on any work skills, all knowledge based information is done by computer."
good,Lowes is an ok place to work.  Management structure has changed and there is an uneasiness among Managers as to whether they will be continuing to work for the company.
good,"HR Personnel very unethical. Did not follow through with making sure HR process was followed. Paycheck wasn't deposited into direct deposit account, causing non refundable overdraft fees. Every time I needed something, it fell through."
good,"Employees were what made it worth going to work, dealing with some of the customers is another story in itself. Working customer service takes a lot of patience and also a willingness to learn about the different departments."
good,Good place to work. The team was small and multi functional. Lots of on call support. Very less development work. Can do better in personnel skill building and in using existing workforce.
good,This employer expects you to do back breaking work for very and I mean very little money. They are not at all organized and do not show very good customer service or respect to their employees. The worst part was working weekends.
good,to many managers that give different jobs all at same time confusing of what to do do the same job multiple time only to get the same result  lowes did not focus on the custermer
good,"Older employee's say Lowe's used to be good to work for. Lowe's keeps reducing the amount of time off you can get, sick days, and missed days. If the management does not like you then you will be in for a miserable time. They will try to find ways to wright you up. No formal training. They just put you with another employee so you only learn what that employee knows. The full-time rotation is horrible. You have to move locations to get promoted."
good,"They've been letting good people go at Lowes. It's a good summer job, but that's it. The place was good to work for years ago, but all I hear are horror stories now from people who were Lifers. Its a temporary gig now, that's all."
good,"Worked with some terrible people always being negative as not a fun environment.  Felt angry every time I went into work it was terrible, no-one did anything about it."
good,"no room for advancement once reach a certain point, management knows who they want before individuals are given a fair chance to compete for promotions."
good,"I worked for Lowe's for almost ten years.  Management overall in uneducated and incompetent. Strictly nepotism.  It's not what you know to get ahead, it's who your after hours drinking buddy is.  Training is all but non existent.  On the up side, if you know your stuff, don't mind the crazy hours and low pay. It's actually a nice place to work.  Just keep your head down and nod."
good,If your looking for just a job then this is the place for you. They recently had a huge down size in the store and did not have any consideration for 10 yr associates
good,"Lowe's does not have set schedule.  The schedule changes weekly and allows for no consistency.  One day you may work until 10:30 and the then the following day be required to arrive at 5:30 am."
good,when i first started it was fun and enjoyable as time passed it became more uneasy to work for lowes as time passed. i had moved up to management and was hoping to move hire and they decided to restructure the company and many of us where given the opportunity to stay after pay cut or move on .
good,Very laid back atmosphere. Lots of support from HR and other management. Family oriented work environment. Large company  nice to work for. Not paid well
good,It was just a job to get by and pay some bills while looking for something else with better pay.It was something to do at all times because this store stayed packed full of people buying things for there home.
good,"My experience was that anyone was expendable and it was a numbers game between retail management and corporate offices."
good,Decent place to work but unfortunately no raises were ever given. Alot of management turnover due to no raises given. In 5 years had 5 different GMs that ran the building.
good,"When I started at Lowe's, the workplace culture was fantastic.  Great managers and employees with possibilities for advancement.  However, the company began to make changes that were very detrimental to business, and a step backwards from the retail atmosphere they had created."
good,they are horrible no management a lot of customer complaints you show up for work and the other employees would not show up and then lowes never had anyone to cover that could do safe deliveries they give you a unqualified employee to go out with you that would not be strong enough to do any deliveries
good,"My first 8 1/2 years with Lowes were stressful but fulfilling.  This last year has been difficult because of a corporate mandate doing away with the Department Manager positions.  "
good,Management has friends that they side with. Work ethic does not exist. The buddy system is outrageous. There are a select few people in the store that does all the work while rest good off.
good,A plethora of policies and procedures and a number of management personnel who are completely condescending of employees. Management seems to foster a culture of insecurity and fear for employment. Double standards also abound between those who are obsequious and those who are not.
good,CEO cares more about stock prices and cutting payroll is the easiest way to increase that. Huge layoffs in last few years all cutting long term employees and replacing some of them with minimum wage kids with no real work ethic and a lack of knowledge of the area they work in. That or they just don't replace the hours and save on the health care end of it. Shipped all the IT over seas along with cutting thousands of long term employees over the last few years in the name of customer service AKA stock prices.
good,"Company is going downhill, would highly advise looking elsewhere for employment.  Sales floor positions are tedious with poor management so you never know what you are doing.  Pay was good, work environment was acceptable, work-life balance nonexistent."
good,I honestly liked Lowe's as a company. I decided to leave because the work hours were to random and they won't work with employees hours.  Managers at Lowe's need more training on how to handle stressed employees
good,Being a seasonal unloader was slow paced and kind of boring. if no carts were available I had to stand around and look busy.  Some Management were rude and couldn't talk to them other management was nice as could be . Overall its a nice place to work just shouldn't have that position.
good,I am having to look for another job due to the hours getting cut. I have been here a little over a year and have seen this store just go down hill. I enjoyed the people I work with for the most part.
good,"I felt like the pay was pretty nice compared to other cashier positions I have worked, but management could be improved upon.  Scheduling of employees is ridiculous, and it feels like almost every day they have to call someone who isn't scheduled in because there's not enough coverage."
good,I started working the place like any job starting out was good. The general manager would treat you like a child so would HR. They have both been removed from what I heard. I was pregnant at time of working there and if I tried going to sit for a few or lean against something one of the managers would tell me to keep walking . NOTE: there would be probably 5 customers in the times I would try to rest and non that needed my assistants.
good,"Overall company was fine. Pay was decent for the job. I was injured on the job due to threats made by manager and after the injury I was deemed to expensive and eventually fired for weak pretenses, simply put they fired me for the cost of the store managers bonus (can actually provide proof of the reasoning). I moved on since then and have grown my business."
good,"Usually started early in the morning, 6 am. Took a host and watered for 8 hours. Sometimes very hot and can not hide from the sun anywere. Lunch time 1 hour, unpaid, not reasonable."
good,Working for lowes was okay.  The work life balance of the company is extremely poor. while working for them I never got a holiday off to be with my family in my hometown.  They would work me 15 days in a row and if I called off because of they acted like it was the end of the work and management didn't treat you well at all.
good,A typical day at lowes would be at least 13 hours. The hardest part and most enjoyable part of working for Lowes is that you're constantly meeting new people at various levels.The enjoyable piece of it is that you get the opportunity to hear peoples story. The down side is that you totally invest in their training and then they leave.
good,"This Lowes was great at first. Wonderful management team, amazing coworkers, and really awesome customers. They worked with me at first, but I had to fight to get full time instead of part time. Then, it all went down hill. I started having health issues,  and they kept trying to make me work more than I was able. They say that they want everyone to have a good work/life balance,  but are not very good at implementation"
good,worked at lowes almost 14 years had to get another job due to management restructure told management about other jobs you would think they would try to keep me since i've been there so long just told me good luck on new job wanted to stay but my new job there would have lost over 800 a month good benefits good employees but asms don't do any work and sevice managers are their puppets bumping heads with each other.Now it's all about who's in management you're cool with not about how hard you work to move upnwasn't like that when infirst started years ago
good,"The workplace environment was fact paced; however, what I learned was to efficiently placed products received from the various companies for quality service."
good,Company has evolved from family friendly employee focused to maximizing profits at cost of employees. Continued chasing of competition has cost company there reputation as respected employer.
good,Worked in the garden center. Not much supervision. Out in the fresh air. Great to work with flowers and trees. Learned a lot about horticulture. Liked interfacing with customers.
good,the hours were ridiculously long sometimes working in excess of 15 hours a day for several days in a row.  The management team was very driven yet overly demanding at times.
good,I was an Live nursery specialist that was on my way to being manager of my department before the elimination of all department managers and specialists from Lowes.
good,"I was one of 3 employees that worked in the department, most of the work was split some what evenly. The work in this department was hard and extremely daunting on my body.  Left almost every day sore and worried my next shift I might get hurt due to the heavy products stocked in the department."
good,"Staff encouraged to participate in creating a hostile work environment.  I was not only encouraged but required to be ""ruthless"" in managing associates."
good,Was once a great place to work.  Poor management from the top down has sold out and only care about dollars not customers.  This is funny considering the message they convey
good,Lowes pays you a nice wage based off experience. No less than $10 which is fair. It is a descent place to work if you can‚Äôt get hired anywhere else lowes is the place to go. I do believe they can do betterbwhen it comes to management.
good,"Hand loading semis, loading trailers from top to bottom, very heavy lifting, on your feet 10hr straight, I loved my job at first, thing just got a little shady."
good,"i remember looking at lowes and depot when i first starting looking into working at a hardware store. Wow a decade with the company and it has shifted away from the company that had a culture of a making sure the associates were happy so we could provide a good service to our customers , to a company only thinking of profits and having managers manager damage control."
good,"This job is good as far as schedule flexibility goes. The management could be a little more strict on how they run things. They recently did away with department managers, which was a mistake on the company's part in my opinion, but things seem to be shaping as the store gets into the swing of things with the new management."
good,"There is a lack of communication between management. Managers constantly are changing their minds which leaves employees frustrated. "
good,Promised a pay raise when I agreed to take on more responsibilities.  Very demanding and little-to-no appreciation.  No advancement opportunities.  Labeled as lateral move with additional demands. Management often criticizes employees in front of other employees and customers.  Highly stressful environment with hostile supervisors.
good,"Managers and leadership do not make it a priority to develop people internally. Because of the culture and size of the company, many leaders have been here for some time and its readily apparent that there is considerable favoritism that goes on. Leadership doesn't like to be challenged, even though they ask to be. . . instead the company has developed a culture of ""Yes"" men."
good,"Not really sure what to say. It was a very stressful job. The store manager was a very difficult person. It wasn't the kind of job I wanted."
good,"set up route and delivery time with morning calls to customers. load and unload product in truck. inspect and clean appliances to be delivered. install new appliances, remove old ones"
good,"The Lowes life I knew paid fairly good and the health, dental, vision benefits were good, but the constant requirement of working all three shifts every week was torture. There was a serious problem with lack of communication from top to bottom, and there were never any soundly enforced policies that were proactive. There was and is bad morale and apathy throughout the store, especially the last two years I was there, largely due to poor management, being very overworked and short staffed, and company wide job slashing in 2017. Was a good job when first started there; the last two years I was there felt like a necessary evil of my life."
good,"Days were relatively consistnt, just depended which manager was on-duty.  Weekly and sometimes daily shift fluctuation made it difficult to plan for work/life balance."
good,"Lowe's could be a great place to work, but the people in management ruin the environment. Very unprofessional, and inconsistent.  Cutthroat environment."
good,I worked at three different stores. The last store I worked at the store management didn't follow policy. The associates are great to work with but the team involvement was bad.
good,"The benefits and pay were great but the schedule was hard to adjust to and had no consistency. Staff complaints were addressed but rarely improved upon, which led to extra stress and tension in the department."
good,"review task assignments with employees"
good,"Good fellow workers, a very busy store in season. On the Outer Banks of North Carolina, very seasonal. Off season low hours can't live on nothing. All I have to say."
good,"The people you work with are okay, but it can definitely become crazy stressful. Especially in the delivery department. Not the greatest communication"
good,"Undervalued, hated working there by far. Seasonal and got hired part time and was still working full time. Trying to get you to work outside your availablilty."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work IF you don't mind being worked to death for little or no benefits. They keep you part time but have you working 35+ hours a week. Management is a mess. The store does not run smoothly on a day to day basis. Employees come and go.
good,Lowes is a mixed bag.  You get benefits which is great but in certain departments your expected to work 10-12 hours 5 days a week.  It is hard to keep up that pace and have any kind of family life.
good,"Your day can start at 6:00 AM.  You may have worked until 10:00 PM the night before.  They would like you to work 50 hours a week.  Some managers are very good, others are world class tyrants."
good,Lowe's probably pays better than the usual retail establishment. But it definitely still has all of the retail headaches. Decent benefits and 401k program. Recent changes to the company seem to have made it harder on the employees still with the company.
good,"At Lowe's or any other retail company, the job should be simple. Take care of the customer, make sure product is Displayed, signed and zoned neatly. The personal however are too close to there employees. It is as if you have to be someones friend to advance there. Not to Mention management treat you as if your expendable."
good,"A typical day for me is to be customer orientated, answer phones, very friendly to the management and coworkers and especially our customers. To ring up orders, process returns, internet orders and any other things that need to be done."
good,overworked doing the job of 3 people. That no matter how much you tried it wasn't good enough. management cared about the profit not the people. no respect
good,"job postings/interviews are a joke, management already know who they want where, they are always changing the requirements of what qualifications you need to have, no matter if you go and do your best and work bust your tail, work ethic is not a plus in the eyes of management. You work and work and management expects more and more from you while others who can care to do barely to nothing can just go to work stand around while doing the bare minimum and collect a check. It's like those who do the least amount of work are those who get praised as if they the ones doing all.the work. Lack if communication, Lack of advancement, basically if your doing a great job where you are located at in the store don't expect for management to consider your interest in any other area of the store. I am currently employed but am seeking work elsewhere. I have too much of potential to keep wasting it where it will never be able to be put to good use."
good,"started off as a great company to work for, but for the past few years company has been going downhill.  The company seems to care less about the employees and more about the bottom line."
good,"Overworked and under-payed, no consistency in work schedule, poor management at my location. Great place to get to know people, both co-workers and the local community."
good,"Lowe's has become ONLY about profit and how they can cut anyone and anything to boost profit. I feel less compelled to attempt to climb the ladder at Lowe's because of how the recent restructuring has created an atmosphere of doubt, anger, frustration, and left an army of employees that have no idea what they are doing and that don't care whatsoever. It wont be long before Lowe's is just a stepping stone to a better job, i.e., a Walmart..."
good,"It's not really the job it's the people. The company has made some many changes that does not make any sense that it  makes the work environment difficult. And with the changes their are no advancement to look forward to as a career,"
good,i'll miss the people but management needs work and they talked lots of me getting to stay at the beginning but obviously that didn't happen. was really hoping to move departments but instead got laid off after my contract ended.
good,"What can I say, it is retail. If you have worked retail you understand. Decent benefits given that it is a giant corporation. The rotating schedule sucks."
good,People hit on you or make you feel uncomfortable and management it horrible at times. Pay is good but the stress isn't. An employee actually tried to fight me because I was assigned to the garden center and she wasn't. As I said not worth the 11 dollars an hour.
good,"Depending on your job title, your day or night can be hectic. Night stocking can be very demanding, sales floor is a pretty good experience dealing with customers, being a cashier is pretty good experience but you are dealing with all customers"
good,"management is horrible, they specialize in some and crucify others, both staff and management is unhelpful and very unprofessional. managers have associates doing managers work and not been compensated enough.store is very dysfuncial and unorganized."
good,"Lowes has swing shifts that rotate your days off every week. I have learned many valuable skills from Lowes like building with customers and vendors, program training, and designing kitchen and bath remodels. Management unfortunately needs some major work. The company treats you as if you are nothing but a number. You only get one day off for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They are not family oriented at all. The job itself is enjoyable and I loved working with customers and seeing the changes I have helped them make."
good,"There's a large bias in moving up in particular stores of Lowes. There's also personal bias when hiring for open positions, often times, employees are hired and do poor work but seem to remain employed regardless of their abilities and knowledge. Management seems like a large curfuffle. Disappointing and uncomfortable.  "
good,"My responsibility at Lowes was to maintain and replenish flooring items before business hours, prior to that i unloaded trailer trucks and sectioned out store items on pallets to be distributed to designated sections throughout the store to be stocked"
good,Lowes has undergone a huge restructuring. In my last 6-7 months there .It includes upper and lower management.our store manager was fired and several department heads .Also many people have quit.It has made for a large amount of complaints from lack of service for our customers. I still enjoy working for Lowes however it doesnt feel like a very secure environment at times.
good,I started as seasonal employee getting up to 39 hours per week. Applied for part time position only to get my hours cut in half. hours are not the best no certain shifts management doesn't interact with employees extra hours cannot be consistant
good,Management is running the store into the ground and doesn't know how they should be running a business. Constantly making changes to everyones jobs inside the store adding more work on for the employees with no type of pay increase.
good,The entirety of my career at Lowe's management has always lacked the ability to properly provide the training of employees to preform a multitude of work related tasks. No repercussions for those who cannot preform work duties or refuse to apply. No system to retain those most talented employees.
good,New manager is changing the whole place. You are not given a second chance if you make a mistake. Having double standards for employees and changing work locations at anytime makes it difficult to balance work and home life.
good,The pay was really nice. The job just wasnt for me.  I didn't enjoy sitting down for eight hours answering phone calls that were most of the time rude.
good,"home improvement retail store . The store is sometimes busy , and competitive . Best part of the job was working with coustomers and the worst part was working with difficult employees ."
good,"Always had something to do, but was a little disorganized. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the worst was management and the hours weren't great."
good,Poor work life balance. Work a different shift every week. Weekend shift is mandatory and you cannot take off as part of vacation. Supervisors want to pass the buck and not take phone calls.
good,I liked working with people but they keep taking our hours away and management don't want to hear anything the workers have to say. And when you try to talk to HR he don't want to hear what you have to say he tells us to talk to the manager for that department.
good,Great place to work for up and coming college students. Not too many advancements and managers are okay. The other associates are really helpful sometimes more than managers but a good place to work.
good,"Very nice people to work with throughout the location in Flanders, NJ during the time I was employed in Retail. "
good,"Worked hard and got dirty every day. Learned a lot about building materials. Met some very nice people, but also rude people. Have to be in good physical shape."
good,"It's retail. a revolving door. managers think they know best and too much favoritism going on. they do pay better then their rival, Home Depot. other then that, its retail"
good,"I've worked for Lowes for 10 years, 7 stores, in 2 states. And for the majority of that time, I've greatly enjoyed my time. But the company has really taken a turn for the worse as of late. Earlier this year, Lowes removed an entire management level, as a cost savings measure. Not to enable better customer service, not to focus more on the employee, specifically to line to pockets of upper management and shareholders. The upper management is even more withdrawn and ignorant to the goings on day to day in each department. Some departments havent seen their ""Managers"" in the almost 3 months since this all started. If you want to work somewhere part-time, as a cashier, or as some temporary position, then this is a fine place to be for a few months. But as far as a career goes, I beg you to find a company that will appreciate you and treat you better as a person."
good,"Lots of ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing"" throughout the company. If you land on a good team you will be fine, if you don't you will be looking elsewhere. "
good,"I have learned an enormous amount about home improvement from Lowes. You learn something new everyday! The company is ever changing. Each day is typically a very busy day, and the associates you share your day with typically evolve to great friends."
good,"A typical day at work includes racing back and forth across the store to give overrides, listening to constant complaints that come from both customers and employees alike, and having little support from managers when trying to uphold store policy to a customer. "
good,"help the customers, keep the work zone clean. Most managers were nice and fair. taking blame for others mistakes and fixing it. talking with customers"
good,"With massive corporate restructuring continuing, fearing job security even more than what happened in January.Company abandoning customer service foundation vs. stock market increase. My conscience cannot handle this. I have served in a corporate structure with a company that thrived strictly on service which made them a premium, sadly to be sold out by a family member that inherited it after EXTREME growth after 80 years. NEED to be home with a privately owned company with ethics! Thank You"
good,"Typical Customer Service. Very fast paced environment with a degree of high stress. If this is your first job it is a great place to work, however, it is very difficult to climb the ""ladder"" and advance in the company."
good,definitely fun and entertaining place to work. but management doesn't support you against the customers and it definitely felt like a boys club. the meetings were a bit fun since they brought breakfast and tried to keep the meetings fun
good,"Lot of good employees that make the store what it is.  The work schedule changes so much you cannot schedule any personal time to do things.  Management sometimes plays favorites when they make the schedules too.  With certain managers, it helps if you are a brown-nosier."
good,I started as part time for Lowe's and got my hours reduced from 25 a week down to 10 hours a week. The schedule is not set and subject to change day to day with no consistency.
good,Job positions are changed often within the store. Never sure how long you will be in same position. Most of the cashiers would work full time but its hardly ever offered.
good,Overall my time with lowes has been pretty good. had a few bumps in the road but what job doesnt. Management is a good group and will always help out when they can.
good,I worked at lowes the day i turned 18 it was my first real job it was okay but pay isnt good at all the location i worked at at the time wasnt managed the best but it was okay
good,There is a great work/home life balance in the current department I work.  Not a great place for advancement  even with the education and the experience needed to advance.
good,"Bellevue lowe's is very poorly managed, it would take 40 minutes just to get a manager (and we had 7 of them a day) just to get the roll up doors open."
good,"Store is poorly managed.  Not enough associates to assist customers.  "
good,"Lowe's does a great job of hiring employees at competitive rates and offering paid time off and benefits even to part-time employees, with the added bonus of some great training for things you might not have expected to love (i.e. mixing paint or selling grills and lawnmowers).  "
good,"I worked my way up into company. When pay was too high they got rid of you to hire someone at cheaper pay. Each store is different, mine was very clicky, if they didnt fit in the group your out."
good,Extremely short staffed most of the time and if you know what you are doing the management will take complete advantage of that fact. After the restructure the whole culture changed and now everyone seems very stressed and on edge.
good,"‚Ä¢	Perform cash, check, credit card, and gift card transactions as a front end cashier. "
good,"If corporate and the high ups would listen, the store could make some changes that would improve sales, the culture of the store. Company barely listens to its own customers."
good,"Don't, do too good of a job they won't let you advance to another position. "
good,"always enjoyed working there! Made lots of friends and met alot of people in the community. You don't get a whole lot of training on anything but they do have resources online to train yourself. Unless you can relocate, there is very little advancement opportunities."
good,"The work is simple, task and customer focus.Hardest part of the job is doing your duties and expected to cover for everyone else. The physical aspect can be tedious. Management is clueless on every level. Recent structure changes and the loss of good employees has made the overall moral plummet. Best part of the job is the people."
good,I have been in the same job since I started.  Raises are only awarded annually and are not necessarily based on job performance.  No formal reviews are given after 90 days or at any point to discuss areas of improvement or praise for work completed.
good,With Lowes new policy the pro builder customers are no longer wanted and a greater effort is put into install sales. They don't take advantage of experienced and knowledgeable people they have on staff.
good,"Didn't give enough hours. Poor management. Lazy employees. Improper loading techniques. No breaks allowed. When it rains, it rains inside. Never know if you will have to work or not."
good,Enjoyed the people at this place.  Management was not that good.  They chose to have job fair and start people from the bottom rather than keep on the people that were alreadt trained.
good,"The associates are good, the management has its ups and downs, there has been a lot of restructuring lately leading to stress in upper management that trickles down to the lower levels. Hours are not conducive to a family."
good,"Arriving at work, we look at manifest for the days deliveries and route out best possible route.  While calling customers to confirm deliveries we would pull the appliances and orders.  We would then load the deliveries print loading tickets for management check.  We would keep in contact with customers on delivery times and schedule.  At the customers home we would remove old appliances if needed, and install new appliances.  At the end of the day we completed the days delivery logs."
good,"Typical day at work busy with customers all day long, learned I was not able to move around as much as I liked in the company, management had their favorites and would let others move around a test for better opportunities, cultural all amercian people. The hardest part of my job, was listening to management promise you things knowing they could not keep their word. Enjoyable part of job, meeting and socializing with a group of wonderful people- at Lowes"
good,"great crew to work with , most issues arose with poor scheduling on managers part. Can be a great place to build a career though as each store has its own team and can perform independently."
good,"The Company is spending more time in preventing theft then "
good,I worked for Lowe's for 17 years and they where a great company to work for until they started getting to big and now is not wanting long term employees.
good,Slow on some weekdays. Learned a lot of different task and responsibility.Management was cool and efficient.My lunch breaks were short and hours were cut short all the time .
good,"worked long hours "
good,The management was uncaring most of the time and did not enforce rules. There was no responsibility for the cash drawer. They made it too easy not to care about coming to work or even doing what was supposed to be done.
good,My day was helping guest checked out ore return items. Setting lunches and breaks. Stocking. Setting the money out or picking it up. Make our guest happy with there projects.
good,"Lowe's can be a very good place to work if you are patient enough to deal with customers in a retail environment."
good,This store hired me for 32 hours a week when I finally quit I was only given 18 hours per week. Hours were never fixed always changing. Many co-worker would not do their fair share of the work always no where to be found! Poor customer service.
good,"Lowe's just went through a drastic change.  They've eliminated quite a few good, hard working people.  They talk about promoting from within, but this isn't always the case.  You have many people in the store capable of moving up, but often times they hire from the outside. The people that work there are great, and deserve better than this.  Lowe's relies heavily on part time help, and they don't always show up for work, or have a good work ethic, so it falls back on those that want to work, doubling the work load."
good,"The job isn't bad, management is ok and fair to the employees. The co workers mostly act like high school kids and talk behind each other's back making the work environment uncomfortable."
good,"Scheduling is unpredictable, you could have to stay longer than your shift or come in on days off. I would be assigned to a department and help customer, answer the phones, put away stock."
good,"So I haven't worked there in several years, but when I did moral was terrible.  Everyone was pretty unhappy and there were some serious issues between management and the employees.  Also several people lost a lot of pay suddenly when Lowes decided to stop paying commission to its sales people.  It was hard on the whole store."
good,"I enjoy the job but this is the worse management team I have ever worked with.  They refuse to listen to suggestions.  If you keep you head down, work, and stay silent you will do okay."
good,"Lowes was an alright job at first, management stops following availability schedules that are received by employees."
good,"As with most Big Box stores, once financial stability is achieved, care and concern for the employee diminishes. The bottom line is most important and people become just a number. Most managers are not true managers."
good,Great people to work with but no job security. I was able to move up quickly. I started as a part-time cashier and moved up to Department Manager over lumber. Will have life long friends.
good,lowes was a good place for at the time i was raining a family and needed a partime income. very little room to move up. i have always been a people person and enjoyed customer service.
good,Lowes is a failing company.  I hate that for all the good friends that I still have there but they are consuming themselves trying to compete in a big world.
good,The pay is pretty good. There is alot of favoritism that happens in the store with Management. You do get to build great friendships with some of your coworkers.
good,The people that work at Lowe's are amazing but your in constant fear of losing your job for no apparent reason.  The culture of corporate management instill the fear of losing your job.
good,Working at lowes was a great experience 2013 to 2015. I learned a lot about customer service and the proper way to treat the customer and there needs. The training was very hands on and easy to show the next person if necessary.
good,Everyday you go in and you do your job. You have specific roles for specific people. For my expierience i had the rolls of all those people in the stocking department. overall just a average retail workplace.
good,I learned how to drive a forklift and order picker. Management is okay. It has its busy days and slow days but overall its an okay company
good,"Big box retailer.  Advancement difficult, but benefits very good.  Very good discount on all product.  Learned quite a bit about different management styles/"
good,Hours are all over the place. They don't schedule you with you in mind. They just fill spots. Even if it's a 3 hour shift. You only know you schedule 10 days in advance. The work is ok.
good,assisting customers and ensuring they are satisfied and fooling through with the sell and adding on sales co workers and very friendly and nice they really help customers love were they live. this job is not very hard at all.
good,It was a long 4 hour shift. Rinse in repeat same thing everything. Constant lifting 50-100 pounds or more of applicances
good,"Between conflicts with managers and lack of support within departments, managing the table becomes a game of chess. Too many self important people and no team skills equal a loss for customers."
good,Management was very hostile to work for.Was treated unfair being a working woman truck driver. Was sexually harrased at work and situation was never addressed.
good,i stock the shelves that come in through trucks in the warehouse. i sort and place them properly through out the store and make sure everythings within safety standards.
good,It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.
good,Employees from locations other than mine loved their management and job. My store had constant management turnover and instability making the workload very difficult for my departments. Every new manager made it very clear that they were only there for corporate advancement.
good,"typical work day would come in see if we had a load, then would have to wait for a manager to open the dock door. then would spend the rest of the night digging out freight from a trailer."
good,This company makes you feel like you can easily be replaced and you are just another number. Very secretive about all things that happen within the company even though most employees are stock holders.
good,If your not in there club they don't like you. I like to g to work help my customers and have a few laughs. I was fuul time then went part time they promised me 20 to 25 hours now were down to 10.
good,"It was an ok job, the only positive thing would be the ability to get the 10% discount.  Other than that, garbage. They're not friendly on flexibility with hours for classes. Management was awful, the few good ones that were there left, making the job very non enjoyable."
good,Very productive work place. Fast pace and somewhat busy at times. Managers are very helpful. Employees were very nice and easy to work with.
good,Was not employed long enough to give a cohesive review. I found the management to be not as engaging and encouraging as they should be.
good,at lowes you work with some really great people but management a lot of the time has to feel that they have to be micro managers about everything you do.
good,Its ok if your going to college and need a little extra money. Some of the managers are ok but the others are just horrible and no appreciation from the store manager
good,"This job will work you to death, and never let you have weekends off, pay is good that was the only good thing about this place."
good,"Fun place to work with continued new faces of customers. Co-workers were great people, the management I believe had some issues with staffing and not enough training before placing employees on the register not knowing what they were doing."
good,"Assisted customers in finding items."
good,Work life balance is a joke. Mostly overworked and under appreciated. It can be wonderful when you have the right Store Manager in place.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. Every Job may have its problems, but we work through it all for the customer and the integrity of the company."
good,decent work environment ; management a little lacking in management-worker communication; very good opportunity w/ worker- customer relations
good,"Worked for Lowe's for over 10 years, and found management to be blind to good qualified workers. The managers I worked with were two faced, and we're not faithful to their employees. Made a lot of promises, failed to honor what they said."
good,"This is overall a great company from the corporate view of employees, but that doesn't always fall down the line to the store levels.  The benefits are also quite poor as well as the pay."
good,okay place to work. they have some bad areas but mostly good. some managers wont give you the proper tools you need to achieve tasks.
good,"the hardest and most enjoyable parts of my job were working in such a fast-paced environment. I learned all there is to know about live goods, landscaping, care and culling of plants, as well as providing excellent customer service to engaged customers."
good,"I enjoyed working there, we were like a family""Lowes  Family"". and just like any family there is going to be drama, but in the end the ones that were there a long time stuck together and worked it out. the store went through a few store Manager and  few Assistant store manager. a hand full of them were really great they listen to us and they helped us, another hand full of them were really horrible they played favor to associates, usually the ones who didn't work be late or just don't show up, and the ones who did work would have to pick up the slack and when they didn't complete something or if they ask for help they say that you are just not good enough at your job. and there were some manager who knew the way we got treated but sid nothing because they didn't want to get involve.  I even had customers complain about management. But anyways Lowes as a company is a good company regardless I know that it all depends on the store you are at. some of my friends who got to go to the other lowes would say that it is just our store."
good,I did not enjoy working for home depot. The customers were friendly. I enjoyed making sales and leads. I did not enjoy my employees as much as i would of liked. I would choose lowes over home depot anyday.
good,"I personally wasn't a fan of working here. Not only is some of the public disrespectful, a lot of the staff members are. Everyone is always just so angry up there and everyone is always complaining. It is like High School all over again."
good,"This place had horrible management. The managers talk about you to other workers behind your back, and talk about them to you behind their back. The managers are all women of the same age group, and love drama. This was the worst place I have ever worked. The managers are pathetic."
good,"I worked in many different departments at Lowes.  My favorite was the lumber yard because I got to be outside all day.  This job is solely customer service where I used the skills I learned here and applied them to my job at Wesleyan.  Since I interacted with people on a daily basis, I learned how to be patient and how to react to those customers who were rude, or took their frustrations out of me even when I was not the root of the problem."
good,Tough company to work for. Management awful and ever changing. Fellow co-workers and customers were great. Lacked training for position. Would not return.
good,"The best part of this position was meeting the public and solving problems for them. The position had hours that did not afford a family life, but the benefits were good."
good,the people at this warehouse are always worried about making the performance score not production numbers. other than the pay it sucked to work for this company
good,"help customers with any and all electrical questions, learned about different breakers and how they are used. Management was not that great, one manager would say one thing and the other say something else. would not allow husband and wife to work at the same store even in different departments or even overnight. co workers were helpful and could count on them. hardest part was keeping the aisles clean and zoned with the small products. the most enjoyable part was helping the customers and getting them what they needed to complete their project."
good,No room to grow. The management team is very dysfunctional. The Job and people I had the privilege to manage are great and a joy to work with.
good,"Overall, this was a good company to work for. Hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day. It was a nice feeling to be able to help out customers."
good,"In the years I worked at this you could not get promoted on hard work, you got promoted on who liked you in management. Too many times did certain people get promoted even when it was known they had recurring accidents that could have been prevented. Working hard is expected but covering several departments at the same time is irresponsible for management when they decide to take all there friends that are associates to lunch with them."
good,"Management was not very good about listening to employees. Work was easy and the hours were good. very short or non existent"
good,"Most days at work were good. I learned many things and the co-workers were good people to be around. The hardest part of the job was basically getting the job. During the summers there wasn't a lot of work to be done and I needed a more secure job that I could count on. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with because they had a great since of humor and a positive attitude towards things."
good,"After the unionization scandal it seems they became very paranoid on corporate levels, and a few years ago they fired many teammembers, supervisors, managers, including dc manager."
good,The direction of the company seems to be scattered.  Too many chiefs.  Change happens constantly with no process to support changes.
good,"I enjoyed working where I worked and the people whom I worked with personally. Although some customers were somewhat difficult, I found that helping them with what they needed was the best thing for the both of us."
good,"This was my 1st ever job but as company excectives changed, it went down hill. i didnt enjoy going to work, didnt want to work with you if you had problems. i miss the people i worked with but i dont miss the issues that went with it,"
good,"Really enjoy the variety of work and customers but work conditions are VERY stressful as we never have enough salespeople to properly service customers. I work most nights and 3 of 4 weekends, all weekends some months. No matter how well you do, it never seems to be enough. The health insurance is very affordable but you get no vacation until after your first complete year of service."
good,"Was a fun place to work with most people, but all of upper management have no idea what they are doing and don't hold anybody accountable for anything.  I loved meeting new people and working with new people, but the corporate managers make it hard to do anything.  Every time you turn around they are cutting hours because another store is doing bad, or they fire someone and don't replace that person so you end up with no one to help any customers, and therefore get angry customers, that don't wanna wait for you to be done helping in the other dept you have to run that day."
good,"great pay..Thats it, no family/ work balance. work you like a mule. Expect you to stay late during the week and then cut your hours on friday so you dont get paid overtime"
good,I worked in the stockroom which was not difficult the hours was not to bad either I didnt enjoy the fact of not being able to advance because we were the weekenders to the oppurtunities to advance was slim to none
good,"Lack of promised hours. Low pay. No overtime even when promised. Very seldom received a 40 hour week, sent home early even when work was available."
good,"Drama City & politics with major problems in skill set of employees. Running off skilled tradesman in field of experience. Electrical,Plumbing,Home improvement, warehouse operations, Fleet management. Management cares about them selves and enjoys creating drama and conflict with employees of all types. and creates untruth of employees to please upper management to keep they costs down. typical retail operations. ( major turn over in employees)."
good,"Management & Corporate office do not seem to be on the same page.  High turnover"
good,If you actually have a life other than work this wouldnt be the place to work. this job literally takes up ALL your time IF YOUR FULL TIME . This job consist of you running all over the store looking for items and they give you a time limit to do so. so basically you have to learn the whole store and have it down packed. You also have to learn how to use there confusing online system. And There training is so confusing . they throw you on a register that has a old system on it and they literally have you doing that for like 2 months . if you work at a lowes that have friendly workers then your good. but if not ? your on your own literally . and theyre system is very confusing
good,"Work in a retail setting, answer phones, run register, process returns.  Answer questions from in store and out of store customers.  Quick paced environment but also has slow periods (depending on the day).  A lot was expected out of each employee that worked customer service, we covered a wide range of responsibilities.  We had a great management team.  We were given one hour lunches which was very nice, allowed to unwind a little before the mad rush started again."
good,I was not a fan of working at this Lowe's I am sure there are some great Lowe's locations out there unfortunately this was not one of them.
good,"As a kitchen designer there are several different activities you complete each week. You would straighten the displays in the store or re-stock  kitchen stock cabinets, counter tops. Assist new or existing customers with orders on both cabinets designs or maybe simply a single cabinet sale for a garage or bathroom addition."
good,Make sure you get any kind of request in writing and witnessed from upper management. Other supervisors will help any other supervisor if needed. Team members are good workers.
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe,s .I love the idea of meeting all types of people, and helping them meet there needs."
good,"A typical day at work requires me to interactive with variety of customers and inquire about their shopping experience, what projects they are working on in their home environment. Determine what their needs are and inform them where to find products and merchandise and offer my knowledge on how to accomplish home improvement projects. Providing customer check-out and giving the customer the correct change, taking payments, and checking merchandise they are purchasing for correct amount, products, quality. Processing checks, credit and debit cards. "
good,I like the job but I can't get enough hours. Its not worth it to me! That's just my opinion. If they would give out more hours than the job would be ok.
good,Management did not appreciate hard working individuals. The different ethnicities that work there make the job fun and time fly's.
good,"Lowe's home improvement warehouse is a great place to not only hone your communication skills, but also is a wonderful opportunity to expand your knowledge of home repairs and be able to apply them to your own home! "
good,"Management did not pull their own weight most of the time.  The head cashiers were forced to take over management roles due to lack of radio calls and phones being answered.  The co workers were respectful and fought through the issues with the head cashiers.  I learned how to take all situations and try and stay calm to resolve them, even if they weren't in my job description.  I mostly enjoyed working with my friendly cashiers."
good,The compnay was okay i wish there was more room for advancement. I enjoy working with customers and employees always a team player.
good,"typical day is very busy, you will learn to pro-active,upper managers are hard to reach .most asso. hit the floor with no knowage but for the most part staff ith dept. will train them."
good,Management was very unprofessional   No one brought me back they are liars they acted like the HR manager wasn't in when in fact she was and they were avoiding me with no explanation
good,there is a new pay rate advisory tool that all new employees are ran through to determine their rate of pay. All existing employees have to promote or demote to be entered into the new pay scale.
good,"not a great place to work, no help not enough people and to much to do. too many people doing nothing and not enough people working"
good,"Management is extremely poor. But, maybe its just the Prince George store. Did like the co workers I work with. Enjoyed most customers, surprisingly though many soldiers from on base are extremely rude."
good,A normal day would be clocking in and standing at a register until the customer's start to come in. I ended up being trained to work customer service desk where I would process returns and maintain a clean work environment
good,"Every day is busy and can be overwhelming. Salaries and bonuses are good. Advancement past the ASM role is difficult if you came from outside the company. Work life balance is poor, Working shifts starting as early a 4am-3pm to noon-11pm. Corporate schedule is in place and to switch a shift is difficult. Lowe's wastes lots of time and resources CONSTANTLY auditing the store. The district operation managers manage with write up threats and negativity. If not for retirement looming the store manager would have moved on to a different company because of these audits."
good,"It's a fast growing company and definitely has its perks. The people are great and the benefits are wonderful. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job is working on machines and dropping freight, and not to mention customer service. The management is okay, and they've taught me to look at the prize in life; the overall outcome."
good,"I came in at 7am and most days the truck was already loaded, I would gather up our loading tickets which had the details for each delivery. Using our delivery phone and GPS we would contact each customer before arrived to let them know we were inbound and to set up a solid time to be there. I was the driver and was responsible for getting us there safely and without incident all while driving in accordance to DOT standards. Once arriving I would greet the customers and begin mapping out how we complete the delivery. We used a dolly and a multitude of tools if required to both deliver and install each job. After getting the product where it went I would test to make sure it was working and take away any old appliances they had. At this job I refined my driving skills and learned how to drive a large box truck over twenty four feet. I also learned how to effectively use a dolly to deliver and hook up any appliance that would go in a household. Using a good array of tools I also became versed in working with my hands. My coworkers came and went often and were there to back me up and help on delivery. The hardest part of my job would have to be keeping up with some days that were very busy, and the most enjoyable would have had to be making the customer happy."
good,"not to bad alot of customer service, cashier,  handle mail, faxes, credit apps., customer complaints, routed calls, handled payments, learned to utilize deplomacy, management needed to communicate better; co-workers needed about the same; hardest part-was having to leave due change in hiring agreement; the customers"
good,"I was hired into Lowes as a paint CSA.  I had over 20 years of paint experience, and I did well at this job.  I was offered a job with a good raise as an outside power equipment specialist. I had little experience in this field, but I learned the job and did well at it, even though I had 5 different dept managers and 5 different zone managers during that time.  Things went well until the last zone manager was in place, and he wrote me up repeatedly until I was let go."
good,"Working with employees, installers and customers to verify that products sold by Lowe's were installed properly and customer was satisfied.  Many of the products sold - patio doors, storms doors had to be pulled and these products were quite heavy and difficult to handle which I felt was the hardest part of the time.  More enjoyable was working with the employees, installers and customers on a daily basis."
good,its a ok place to work if your starting out to work. long hours little pay co workers not that friendly.
good,"As a Customer Service Associate I assist customers daily. I constantly read units of various measurements and calculate flooring areas. I'm very comfortable with doing quick math in my head. I'm always on my feet walking everywhere. I'm also comfortable with working outside in all kinds of weather in delivery and installment of products and services. I have also been successfully trained for use on a forklift, which I have done for Lowe's."
good,"For most I have met at work they are using this job to help pay bills part time or as a stepping stone to there next move, almost anyone can be in in management almost is the key word but if you are in the clique you can do anything. Lowes does not look at there employees as anything more then an expense. They need to change that outlook they should look at there employees as an investment, in doing this they would not have such a large turnover."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes very much. I built good relationships as well as leadership skills in the beginning of my management position. Unfortunately, communication with management and employees was something that was in great need of improvement"
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Duties "
good,"the interaction with everyone including customers was GREAT."
good,"This place is small and hard to advance. Their pay is ok, but can be better. The management do not really do anything except pressure you into making a mistake."
good,"The big problem I see with Lowes is that there are too many middle-managers, and thus lots of micro-managing."
good,"rotating schedules dont work, and if u cant work weekend forget bout it"
good,"Its a box store, need I say more. I don't see people having a career with this company, but some do. Hours a all over the place, training is non-existent and brown nosers move up fastest."
good,The pay was not bad but it is very hard to advance.  Management seems to be looking out for themselves. Scheduling was horrible.
good,Was Passed over for full-time postions I was more qualified for because I wasn't bubbies with the people who did the hiring plain and simple. I enjoyed what I did but disliked the people I had to work for.  They were not good leaders.
good,LOWES used to be a company that cared about it's customers and it's employees. Now that has all changed. LOWE's cares about profit! That's it. The standards at LOWE's have been lowered and the professional teams have all but left. Knowledgeable employees don't really exhist there anymore. They only want bodies walking the isles.
good,Its a decent job if you're in a transitional period. If you're a seasonal worker you get treated almost as if you're a second class citizen.
good,"Early hours"
good,"Lowes has good benefits but the pay isn't all that great unless you are in management. The management isn't all that great, they don't talk to each other so there is a lot of confusion when tasks are supposed to be completed, and they don't work together as a team. Most of the employees don't work together as a team which in the end makes everyone's job harder. I currently work nights and I have a great manager who stays on top of things but my pay isn't all that great and our raises are only 3%... A job for students it is a great starter job but not when you are trying to go somewhere."
good,"The management is very unorganized. The coworkers gossip too much. Also any issues go unfixed. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy. I enjoy giving great customer service, and the spiritual benefits that I receive from it."
good,Good company to work for if you are looking for a second job. Their are opportunities to move up in the company.
good,A typical day was assigning lunches and breaks for the cashiers taking care of overrides the hardest part of my job was the hours that i worked and the most enjoyable was dealing with the customers
good,This was a temp  job  as cashier and customer service. I worked returns as needed
good,"Days consist of great associates who come together to help one another and achieve quotas for the day. Some days may be slower than others, but can still be productive if you work hard. Management can sometimes ignore lower positioned employees. For the most part all other associates are great."
good,"The best part of the job was a clean store."
good,"Lowe's is a fun place to work for the most part. Good benefits, however if you are.full time you have no control over your schedule, so you can say goodbye to your weekends. If you don't mind not moving your position and doing the same job for a couple years without being.able to move up then you'll do just fine."
good,"Training cashiers with different process i.e. returns, self-checkout, & customer service"
good,"Good coworkers"
good,long hours hard work bad pay bad management not a job i would recommend
good,"Standing at cash register, greeting customers and taking care of their purchases, providing a good experience,"
good,There isn't much to say. I loved interacting with the customers and solving problems for them. Management was unorganized at times and when I would bring up more efficient ideas they were always shot down.
good,"Lowes is a fast pace, always changing work enviroment. The management was'nt helpful, often times turned customers away and disappointed thier employees on a regular basis. I enjoyed learning another skill and responding to the customers needs in a timely fashion. Co-workers are a joy to work with. Most enjoyable time is those moments where im able to meet a customers needs and going above and beyond my job role for thier satisfaction."
good,Days can be very long and very busy or sometimes boring. Filled with making every customer happy and ringing people through.
good,"I was always on the move, always helping someone. The hardest part was when I was the only cashier and had 12 people in line."
good,"I loved my actual job. It was hard work, but I understood it, and could easily keep up with it's fast paced work life. I didn't, however, like the managers. You got no credit for the work you did, and always reprimanded for the things that weren't done. I liked my job, I just would have preferred it maybe at another location."
good,"wide open"
good,"Every had a great attitude, however no opportunity for promotion."
good,Nice place to work but absolutely no scope for advancement or any hope of getting any wage increase.
good,"Just cashiering, learning the products, management was ok, co workers were ok to work around , hardest part was standing in one place. just being out in public"
good,"As a corporate view its a great company but at store level its rough. If your not sleeping with someone in management or ""in bed"" with management you WILL NOT have a career, period. Only the good ol boys get promoted."
good,seriously dont ever go to lowes unless u know exactly what u need and exactly where it is. then leave quickly
good,"I enjoyed the interactions with the customer, sales specialist, vendors, and installers.  My nature of work consists of organizing sales documentation, paying invoices, maintained the sales budgets weekly, overseeing the installation process from start to finish.  I am most comfortable working in a past paced work environment."
good,"In a typical day, you will only have a good time because of the people you work with. The management is unfair and does not want you to move up in the company, as much as they lie and tell you they do. The job overall is not hard, the hardest thing is dealing with angry customers and terrible management. The people that work there only stay because they pay better than any place in town. However; they suck the life out of you and hate if you are having a fun or enjoyable time at work."
good,"I personally loved everything about my job at Lowe's. The only complaints that were to be had were that of management...many of the people given raises and advancement opportunities were not those who deserved them, but those who were ""liked"" more. Favoritism is a huge problem at this particular store. I worked as hard as I could for the majority of the time I was hired on at Lowe's, and had to walk out when my hours were cut down to 4 hours a pay period (bi-weekly), despite my numbers being in the top 3 for my department (consistently)."
good,"I learned about mens sizes, and how to interact with customers."
good,its was a good place to work you were always busy but they are not a family company like they say they are. but its good benefits and that's about it. the management needs to improve there are a lot of coaches that look down on you out now on the co workers there are a lot of people that are nice and that will help you out when u need it. the hardest part of the job was lifting really heavy boxes and being stressed out.  the most enjoyable part was when u get to work at your own and u don't have to worry bout others.
good,"Originally I enjoyed working for Lowe's HIW but the longer I was there I noticed favoritizism and an off-kilter workload. Females were not promoted as often as males. Management and HR could care less about working with your schedule or making time for family emergencies. Good benefits but HORRIBLE work hours, no set schedule"
good,"Working here is good enough. They treat you fine and it's pretty much exactly how you would expect it to be.  You only get one weekend a month working full time. The shift schedule is all over the place, which makes it hard to have much of a life.  "
good,"Decent company, crazy hours and pay is often based on if you are a brown noser. "
good,"Lowes is a great place to work!!"
good,A typical day a work is exciting and I learn new things everyday. I enjoy working at Lowes and learning how to help people with their home improvements.My co-workers are very easy to work with and dont mind helping you when you need help and management is very helpful when you need them.
good,"I began working at a Lowes in Mckinney when I first moved to texas, I later transfered to the location in Little Elm. I always did very well in Mckinney, but when I moved to Little Elm I began to have several issues. I was being degraded a lot, down talked, and mistreated. Later on in the year of being at the little elm location, I got pregnant with my daughter, and things took a turn for the worse. They made me stay outside for 6 hours without a bathroom break. They would not let me sit down, even with a note from my doctor. The people I worked with some were great, and some were not so great. I had someone type a nasty hate letter about my pregnancy and put it in a locker. Management didn't take it serious, and eventually caused me to quit my job for my safety and the safety of my daughter. I can't really remember a part that was enjoyable. I can say since I left, the past 3 years there has been completely new staff and ALL new management. There is not 1 manager that is still there when I worked there."
good,"A general step in the process. I was able to interact with the public, which I think was my general favorite part of the process. "
good,"After working for Lowes I'd have to say that I would work for the company again. Mainly because my job had me on my toes the entire time I was on the clock. I saw my job as a workout and helped everybody whenever possible, even ran or jogged on the job within and around the store grounds whenever possible. The only problem I would have now, is the ""new management"" that Lowes has, the new Store manager seems to be a bit of a racist. Coming from Idaho to Merced CA I can see why he wouldn't like working around certain people. The Co-workers were great, as a loader I had to establish a certain relationship with all the front end cashiers. They all liked me very much and always knew who to go to when they needed help.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was all the sweat and hard work that I had put into Lowes. "
good,I liked being in charge of receiving team and showing the skills I learned throughout my life. Even teaching managers how to do some things they did not know. Being a team player was something I am very use to and was able to adapt to any job.
good,"A typical day started with checking inventory levels of assembled items, usually gas grills in the front of the store. Then I would check the computer for an up-to-date build list provided by mangement. Customer orders received priority over store inventory."
good,Enjoyed working here but didnt like the pay. If you can handle the public then this is not a bad place to work.
good,"Same challenges as all retail positions, except working at Lowe's feels more fulfilling due to the nature of the home improvement industry. There is a need, and you work with clients who really depend on your skills, knowledge, and quick thinking to solve issues ranging from contracts,leaking pipes,installation issues, deliveries, inventory management and creating maintenance work-orders for a safe shopping environment. Operating FORKLIFTS of all classes, and constantly learning from clients that range from project engineers to landscapers."
good,I worked Cashier register right after college for a couple months. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,Not many great things about this company. They are customer first and have no regards for their employees
good,limited opportunity for advancement on personal accomplishments
good,i liked there a lot you went in and i done what needed to be done and the guys i worked with were ok. the job was not hard at all you this done what needed to be done
good,"When you need anything for home improvement go to Lowe's. They treat their customers with respect and their employees overall good unless your not a manager. They taught me how to hone my management skills when it came to multi- tasking, budgeting, and improving scheduling skills. The interaction between employees was the best part of the job, but the hardest was the hours would change and weekends were always working either on or off store property."
good,its pretty slow unless we have freight I like alot of work all the time
good,"A typical day in my departments is usually pretty fast paced a lot of customer service, learning new things day by day from customers or employees. Very physically demanding. A lot of loading and unloading of drywall, wood, cement, bricks and other products purchased or returned by a customer. You work with a lot of really cool people who are usually available to help out or keep you laughing. hardest part of the job is learning to operate certain machines."
good,It was a rewarding 5-year experience. The culture is changing and it looks like the company will become more open to diversity of thought.
good,"aprendi a el uso de montacargas de gas, rr, op y pues mucha rotacion de personal."
good,"It was an experience that I learned a lot from. Co-workers were great and treated me great, management on the other hand not so much. Hardest part about the job was facing the management. Management would discipline you one way, and another member of management would come by later and would make you feel you didnt do the job the correct way."
good,"Typical day at work is answering multi-line phones, researching billing and other problems. I also handle problems with customers and running a register to except payment and sales of items."
good,"mixed paint, cut blinds, ring up customers, greet customers."
good,It is a very long term position but it also takes sacrifices to be in this position. Hours that are very topsy turvy. They change all the time.
good,"I worked for this company for several years. While I enjoyed the people I wirked with, the company itself was in turmoil all the time. There were several layoffs and changes in policy constantly."
good,coworkers were great
good,The lowes job was cool until i ran into a conflict with scheduling for school that in the job was seasonal
good,"Lowe's requires long hour. Lowes does provide some associate driven activities but requires seperation of management levels with no interlevel fraternization thus limiting morale and comaraderie. For senior management there is no outlet for discussing frustrations,concerns or job inequities."
good,Fast paced retail sales. Opportunity to learn a variety of duties. Customers are a joy to work with. Good job for students just looking for a short term job while finishing school.
good,You meet a lot of diiferent personalities from the different customer that you have to deal with.
good,"Open and Close store, Help customers, Restock shelfs, Keep work area clean and organized. I learned about turf management, herbicides, pesticides, pool chemicals, landscaping, and all outside power equipment. I got along great with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was closing, only one hour to get every thing done. I always got the job done though. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was dealing with the customers and making those big sales. To bad the job was only seasonal."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day would be assisting customers with any type of question be it smart to difficult. I enjoy helping customers and assisted with their daily home projects. A typical day could be excorting customers to their certain department and comply to their needs maybe plumbing to hardware. Then maybe it may be showing them where checkout is and ask if they need assistant to their car.
good,"Working for Lowe's was fairly ok. It wasn't the worst job and wasn't the best. I learn a good bit about customer service. I felt that there was no room for advancement with this company, well at least the store I worked at. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers."
good,"This is for our local Lowe's. There were too many underhanded activities going on in the management. You had a thankless job unless you were a cute cashier. Very dirty office politics. It's a real shame too because 90% of the people there were amazing, the management sucked though!"
good,"Lowe's is an ok company to work for. They do offer medical and dental coverage. Advancement can be difficult at times. However, they do offer quarterly incentives for the best stores in each district."
good,"Okay company to work for if you are already trainned in the postion which you are applying for. Sadly they do not offer good nor proper training for new employees. Most employees are good people to work with. Hardest part about my job is I am the only person with my training, So I am never able to get relief. So its been hard to schedule time off at times,"
good,"cut blinds,worked customer service ,couldnt fulfill goals"
good,"Good people to work with. Good cooperation on shift. Standing or walking for most all the shift, and much heavy lifting."
good,"When i first started working for Lowe's it was a good experience. Some of my co workers were friendly and some were not. I got moved from 3 different departments because they were short of people. I was a seasonal employee but I was doing a full time persons job. A typical day of work was just coming to clock in, assisting customers and then helping out on the register. I was asked to stay later some days and given extra hours but they never gave me a promotion to full time or part time. All of the customers I helped told the managers what a good employee I was. I loved helping them and it seemed as though my hard work was not paying off and wasn't being noticed. The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated the way I should have been."
good,Helping customers load/unload Items
good,When I first started working here a lot of my co-workers would tell me that others would try to get you in trouble. I didn't want to believe it until I noticed it for myself. Some workers would tell you the wrong info just in order to get others written up. The bad part about this was that it was the managers trying to get their workers in trouble.
good,once you clock in you go to your assigned area and assist customers as needed
good,"All in all, I enjoyed my job at Lowe's. My only real complaint is the enormous pressure put on cashiers to drive add on sales, I'm all for a challenge, however, there comes a point when enough is enough."
good,I have nothing to say because this was a part time position with no advancement
good,"pull installers product, verify product before going out store."
good,"The pay was decent, above minimum wage, but the hours are terrible as a cashier. I would be scheduled for 19-20 hours a week but it would take five days to get those hours. Most of the days were 4 or 5 hour days, which is not good when you are paying a babysitter to keep children. It is very difficult to become a full-time cashier with this company."
good,"When I first starting working at lowes everything was ok, but now it seem like it's getting worst and worst"
good,"The first store manager I worked for was great. He was professional and built me up. I was pushed to succeed and advanced quickly. However, when I transferred back to St. Louis there was little support from upper management and no drive for advancement."
good,It's ok place to work at . Some of the people was being jerk's. but most of the time I like to be around some of my good friends that worked there at time I worked for the company.
good,"depends on location. they dont treat you as a person and arent very undertstanding of diabetics needs"
good,The job is good but managers could care more.  Sometimes they put job duties off on other associates that the manager is supposed to do.  Most of the associates are hard workers and good people.
good,"Tension between coworkers "
good,You as a person are only as good as the numbers you deliver. If you like crazy pressure then ris will be a good fit for you if not it will drive you into the ground and you‚Äôll have nothing to show for it.
good,"Not a wonderful place managers were a nightmare,  employees were amazing,  hrs were ridiculous and never consistent,  understaffed constantly due to emotional abuse"
good,"Lowes Inc. was a decent job. However, the training doesn't exactly cover all of the tasks that are expected of you. The management is a bit confusing but other than the minimal training and the confusing management, it is an ok job"
good,"Great place to work , especially with new CEO. Most  associates resist some of the new changes which results to a difficult work environment.  Overall the pay is ok, but you will earn every dime"
good,This was a great part time job to have during the summers. The people who came in were usually nice along with my co workers and you learn a lot on the job.
good,It was fun until we got our current manager and it change drastically it didn‚Äôt feel like a job I looked forward to. Before there‚Äôd be incentives and reasons to do your job and now it felt like the store is just there to be there nothing great about it
good,"Not enough employees, part-timer hours are always cut. Managers are extremely stressed.  A typical day is IRP's at 6 am, DSHR, doing frieght not done at night, Power Hours between 10 and 2. Never enough time to task completely. If you are a closer it is downstocking, work a bay etc."
good,The workload and customer interaction is constant.  Can get both overwhelming and boring sometimes. Not much opportunity to move up to management level.
good,Company is going through major changes so the work life balance is nonexistent. Several positions were eliminated as a result of the publicized changes.
good,a lot of employee are not treated with respect and talked down to promotions seem to be pr determined ther are some good people i work with but lowes seems to be on a downward spiral employee moral is low
good,"If you would like a stable job in the retail world, Lowe's is the place to go. There will be times where you will have to do more than your job but take it as experience and learn all you can so you can become a manager."
good,"If ur not a favorite or someone's pet u get NOWHERE!!! Experience, job performance, time in position has ABSOFREAKINLUTELY no bearing on anything. Its all whos rear end u kiss & how long & deep!"
good,Good place to work.   Coworkers were helpful and fun to work with.  the management team was not much help but others were willing to help if needed. Management hade issues with integrity which led to workers not believing anything they said.  Home and work life cannot be balanced with this company.
good,"It's a retail job focused on corporate profits. Some opportunities to volunteer , but otherwise soulless. You can make it your own if you enjoy helping people with their projects, but you receive little to no training on the products so you must already be an expert."
good,"There‚Äôs a lot of improvements needed. The work field isn‚Äôt bad, but not great. Bias, and if you are friends with managers you do not get pressed as hard as others."
good,"Although hours are fair you are taken for granted at this job, the pay could be a little better for all that you have to tolerate if you are looking for something to balance while you are in school just to pay bills highly recommend"
good,"Employees are expected to follow company policies and procedures but when a customer argues about the policies they are dismissed and the customer gets whatever they want.  What is the point of establishing policies that will not be adhered to.  Associates are frequently treated with disrespect from customers, which is accepted by the company.  The customer is always right attitude is the companies overall mission."
good,This is a part-time job to add to income.  That is all I have to say about this work.  The hourly pay is low for the work expected.Working outdoors is nice most of the year.
good,"The task at hand is not worth the benefit, you will receive soul crushing crippling depression, sales people lie constantly in order to sale, management lie constantly to keep workers, while at the same time urinating on you with harder work and responsibilities to meet their responsibilities. Lol"
good,It‚Äôs a good company and I like working there it gives a good workout everyday unloading trucks and stocking merchandise everyday. I like what I am knowing what will I be doing every day.
good,"Here recently since we have got a new CEO there has been little to no warning about changes. Many part-timers are losing hours because of the new scheduling program and full-time employees don't get a full weekend for eight week. It has just made working there unpleasant, you either can work a 10 hour shift or a 4 hour shift just depends on what the computer decides for you that day."
good,Management never around to assist associates or customers allways on there cell phone or in office hiding from the real situation need managers that are gonna work for there salary and walk what they talk other then that a great place to work
good,"Easy job. Coworkers were cool. Management was fairly cool, had a couple managers that were rude and lacked respect for a hardworking outgoing individual. Constantly pushing to work over hours, well aware i worked another, much more ""real"" and physically demanding full time job and between both jobs was working 80 hrs a week. i did this for about 8 months. I asked for a reduction in hours back to 20 hrs and they encouraged me to just quit and harassed me for it and demanded i stay late to stock shelves til 11pm knowing darn well i had to be up for my other job at 4:30 am then work lowes after til close the next day. So i quit after about 3 weeks on 20 hr weeks."
good,Job consists of helping customers and moving freight. Helping other employees in there departments and loading products. Resolving customers issues and working as a team.
good,"Made me feel like a number puncher no individual feeling "
good,Lowes is all about the bottom dollar and cares only for numbers. A far cry from when they were a mom and pop shop 60 years ago. Just another big box store that could Care less about customers or employees.
good,"Do not work here if you want to move up, Home Depot leadership is invading Lowe‚Äôs. If you want to fit in, this is a great job for you.  Standing out gets you nowhere. Going above and beyond just becomes expectation, not appreciated one bit."
good,It was fun talking to customers and explaining lawn and garden. Got to sell lawn equipt and patio furniture. You're never standing in one place all the time
good,"On top of your daily responsabilties which are helping customers and making sales, you will have to clean your dept, get carts/ board cutting. You will be expected to know a lot about everything in the store once you are not a part time employee."
good,Need better ways to evaluate employees in all aspects of ability and advancement. Need to communicate with each and all employees better. Need a better way for employees to give ideas and opinions to management.
good,It has its ups and downs like anywhere. But lots of changes has caused issues. And management could be better. But it‚Äôs a decent job for someone starting out.
good,"Hard work, heavy lifting, manager watches you like a hawk.nut does nothing to help.just watches.not team player. Several employees quit because of him"
good,You're always busy. Some of the employees are pretty cool some of them are rude. the hours are nice and the breaks are pretty great. they give ice cream when its hot and cold bottles of water.
good,"Company pays well in the corporate office, lots of perks. I enjoyed many things about working there.  But, Management wasn't qualified to do their own jobs much less help us with ours.  The more you complained about how much work you had the more likely you were to get someone assigned to help you.  So while I would be required to help other people while keeping up with my own job too and make them look good, they would be busy doing ""projects"" getting themselves noticed and getting promoted.  Sounds fair right?  Company kept going around in circles expecting different results, sad. Constantly changing things every 3 months. Change is good if it helps the company succeed, but it didn't."
good,"I enjoyed my job for the most part, however promotions and pay increases were not always fair to say the least.  The work environment was not always professional sometimes uncomfortable. To much change and not dependable ."
good,I love the customers here and enjoy working with them on their projects and special orders.  The only stress I actually have is when they want me to ignore my customer service standards.  I have a hard time walking away and letting customers just stand there.
good,"After a year and a half of working at Lowes, I came to realize that the organization is either designed to lose money or isn't managed effectively. I spent about 6 months in the Appliance Department where I felt as if I was doing five different jobs. I took incoming calls and dealt with customer complaints on sales that weren't mine, I retrieved products for customers who were purchasing appliances for carry away, sold appliances to customers in person using an antiquated MS-DOS based computer program with a steep learning curve; as well as assisted customers in other departments I had not been adequately trained in. Lowes starts with a good training program, but expects that it will do a good job of educating their employees, and then expects their employees to know everything based upon a generalized computer presentation. It fails to tell you everything you need to know about how the departments actually function, and every department - depending on who runs it functions somewhat differently. "
good,"Needs improvement in the work/life balance area. I feel like I live here. Everything else is pretty alright. Employees are run of the mill, some work, some don't."
good,Lowes in itself is a good company but management does not communicate with the workers or each other.  They will give you a task and another manager will give you another task and expect you to complete them outside of power hours (10-4). Management needs to get its act together and communicate better!
good,It was a more pleasant place to work many years ago when I started and then it became very stressful trying to keep up with the work that was involved in the department I was in.  You had to perform the jobs of many with few or you were by yourself. At one point I was on salary and working 60 and sometimes 70 hours a week.  This is very demanding on your physical being and stressful on home life when you were at home.   It was pleasant sometimes when you could work with a customer on a project and find something that worked for them and the outcome was positive.
good,"The coworkers were team players and made the work environment fun. However, the management team delegated instead of showing proper leadership. Favoritism was played and they did not respect your availability."
good,"Associates over 45 (with a few 20-30 year old exceptions) are carrying the workload and customer service.  Salary marginal for what is expected in terms of availability and expectations.  Senior management is apathetic at best.  Department managers trying, but have no leadership training.  Good job for students and those looking to make a little money, but part time jobs are first hours cut or let go."
good,"The work can be physically demanding, but you're paid fairly.  Just be careful to follow the training you don't get to the letter.  You can meet some good people at Lowe's the customers are usually very easy to work with.  It's retail, you get the occasional difficult person.  Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"I thought management was bizarre.  If they wanted you to do something you were praised on how wonderful you are and how they hand selected you for your skills and personality.  But ask them for anything and they look down at you. Not every manager but most of them.  "
good,Started off as a great job with opportunity to advance. Recent changes in corporate has made job security less sure and severely curtailed the chances of moving up in the company.
good,My day consists of watering plants in the Garden Center and the front of the store.  I interact with the customers on a professional manner giving my best customer service possible.  With my education I can give some solutions and advise to customers.
good,I loved being a cashier but the location I was working didn't want to move people up on management unless you were in a buddy system.  I worked very hard done a fantastic job with customers and was not made feel welcomed or appreciated.  I would hope not all Lowes stores are like this.  Every week you were assigned different hours and one opening next closing.  There needs to be consistent work hours and guarantee of a position.  I was given a full time position and had it taken from me while my manger was on vacation.  Corporate needs to be more aware of how bad the management is.
good,The managment team will not back you up. Customer will complain because you follow the rules. I worked for 6 years in the company at different locations being trained for management and this location tells me I have no idea what I am doing and know nothing. But leaving was the best thing that happened. I am now making double what I left there with and enjoy what I do.
good,Way too much turn over at this store. Many departments were without any associate on any given day. This situation created stress in most departments and lost sales on z daily basis.
good,"Generally, Lowe's is pretty okay to work for, though they're generally inconsistent, and it depends a lot on the store you go to. Pay is relatively okay but inconsistent between departments and workers. Management is highly store-dependent, and can change very rapidly with the current structure. Some coworkers have been displeased with the upper level functioning of the company, but most of the time you aren't directly affected at all. I actually enjoyed the job itself; it's department dependent, but generally you're always doing something, yet it's not too high stress. High traffic areas like the seasonal section and hardware/tools are much more stressful than departments like electrical or millwork, though you spend a lot less time bored. Hours are generally flexible, though can be extremely highly variable and inconsistent. In my time in electrical, I learned quite a lot about electrical work, even despite my background as an electrician's assistant, I think I learned more about it at Lowe's than I did on the job. If you enjoy helping people and completing projects like I do, associate positions can be quite rewarding, despite the times of boredom and shelf-tidying. Hardest part of the job is between the occasional very heavy lifting and making sure customers are fully satisfied."
good,"My overall experience wasn't bad, not great, but not bad. There are lazy people who get no push to work harder so you end up picking up slack with zero incentive. Customers can range from extremely friendly to extremely rude, and a few times I was called names with no provocation by a customer. Management doesn't care to hear your outcries if something needs to change. It's like they're all in this exclusive club that doesn't care about their baseline workers at the bottom rung of the ladder. After many months I started slacking because they didn't want to give any raisea even though I worked harder than others in my department."
good,"The culture is changing, it seems like no ones job is safe, But it pays well and it is employment... If you don't mind being micromanaged and being told to do one thing one day and than another the following day it is the place for you"
good,Most people are nice but then you have some employees who let their title make them act like the are better then you. Plus you never know what your schedule for the next time period will be they put up schedules for 3 weeks at a time.
good,"Lowe's is an okay place to work. They do have a cashier appreciation month that includes a party for the cashiers. Sadly, Lowe's is a company that does not work well with school and furthering your education. I have been scheduled on days I said I was unavailable. They have a hard time letting you off for class and school reasons."
good,"I was part time Seasonal at Lowe's in Garden. I had terrible pay, and would very often only be scheduled at time 15- 20 hours a week if that. My pay checks were not more than 300 dollars. The coworkers I worked with were really kind, understanding, and knowledgeable in their respective areas. The scheduling system is horrendous because they use a scheduling software called kronos, and depending on what your supervisor starts your hours off at when you begin working dictates what your schedule becomes. Scheduling was all over the place because of that. Never was able to get a set day or time off. LATE EVENINGS AND NIGNTS! I worked evenings, or days and evenings, and ended up staying until 1am multiple times because morning, and early afternoon crew goofed off and did not finish task on time or at all."
good,"Overall LOWES is a great place to work, especially if you like the human to human interaction, you get tons of that. But the only downside in my opinion is the poor management."
good,As with any company there were draw backs mostly with management. They were good about training in just about any aspect of retail.  But with most large corporations they did not seem to care much about the individual employees but only what was profitable.
good,"Regular meetings with the highest-level purchasing decision makers to conduct supplier annual"
good,"I was a very valued employee, was the go-to guy to get things done, and done well, was responsible for keeping the department running smoothly which meant cleaning up everyone else's mess, but was not able to be hired full-time (in my department) specifically because I did not work on Sundays even though I worked every Saturday and Friday."
good,Retail work that is becoming more corporate everyday.  We had better pay and bonus structure in early years.  Lack of quality management and follow through on plans has hurt us in the recent years.
good,"Lowe's on paper can be very good for young students applying for a job. The benefits it give with  medical and dental are very attractive. Yet, working there is a different story. The hours were consistent for me. But not too flexible  and we would have to trade shifts to get certain days off. Worked there for a year and was treated like a mistake. if you make a mistake they'll usually punish you in some way. For me I was stuck in one section of the store permanently. while other employees got to work in less busy areas of the store that were't heavily monitored by management.  Moving on, Most people hired by Lowe's are temporary hired (especially cashiers) and if we perform well enough after the hiring season (say like a summer) then they decide who they keep as a perma hire. What they don't tell them is that their hours get cut down to part-time.  Lowe's tries to get by with the bare minimun amount of staff necessary to keep operations running, or at the very least speads the employee's hours out so much that most departments are empty causing customers to then harass the cashier(s) who is already bogged down by quick forming lines of customers. TLDR: It's a decent paying job, with good benefits but working at the Lowe's can be depressing and frustrating, be ready to speak to customers and learn quickly how to wiggle out of customer issues, is you can handle that are standing around bored in the middle of a cashier desk for 9 hrs you'll be fine. Oh, and don't call out ever. They'll holds any NCNS against you for a year. That's why I'm writing this."
good,"I would not tell anyone to change jobs for this business. What they make up for in competitive wages, they lack in job security. They do not think twice about the workoad. They pile it on until you cant possibly get it all done on busy days. They dont supply you with the needed information and they do not give you time for the training you might possibly need. The customers and co-workers are wonderful for the most part. Scheduled hours bounce all over and you work all holidays whether it is your weekend off or not. You days off are never guaranteed."
good,Had a terrible lead cashier and manager that really made you not want to come into work most days. Made the day really drag out and dreadful. You will be standing all day and you do get 15 minute breaks sometimes.
good,Simple interview with HR. They ask questions and give scenarios of previous job related experiences. The process to be hired has changed since I interviewd so it may be a little different now.
good,"When first started job was very enthusiastic about going to work. As time went by and people came and went, management changed constantly the workplace atmosphere went downhill. To me they dont invest in and appreciate workers who have been there for a long."
good,A great deal of turnover. Promotions were advantageous for males. Requests for vacation were reluctantly given.  Slow to approve sometimes less than two weeks before request making it hard to make reservations.  Would suggest using comp.time before paid vacation when comp. time would be paid at years end and unused vacation time would be lost.
good,"It was my first job, was nervous of course. After my first month I settled in and was comfortable with everything  went in as part-time, asked to be full time but wouldn‚Äôt let me."
good,"Lowe's is a good company, they just have made some policy changes that have invoked a lot of change. Not necessarily good change. Overall it's a good started job and does not make a good job long term."
good,"Management is poor, very little communication. Some managers expect everything to get done with or without adequate help. Some jobs, such as operating a forklift, require two people and they regularly only schedule one person in the areas that use forklifts."
good,Typically growth if politics of store management are not into play. Cross training is fair due to lack of employees in other areas. My particular store did not have the best management but for full time employees they offer great benefits.
good,"It was great when i first started, unfortunately it has steadily declined since then. management has taken a turn and they seem to promote employees that don't really do anything while overloading the hard workers until they quit."
good,It's a pretty good job to work for. There was really no incentives to work there while I was there. Pretty relaxed at times but stressful when holidays came around
good,"I had different areas of the store in which they wanted you to work, which was ok but if you dont know for example anything about tools, then it does help and customers get irritated. The hardest part was they wanted you to get more customers to apply for their credit cards, but customers were not really wanting to if they didnt it marked against you"
good,"Lowes is a job that you can excel in but it wouldnt be worth it unless you see yourself staying there,super stressfull environment,always short staffed and management isnt always willing to help,past those things its a good job to keep for the money and benefits."
good,I was happy with my employment with everything except the work schedule. 10 hour days are too long. The new CEO decided to abolish my position and gave only a 28 day notice to find another job. Not happy!
good,Unorganized and did not have a mutual understanding of the return policy. Poor customer service team and no opportunity for growth within the company.
good,"I had a wonderful experience with my direct superior.  He was very passionate about his job, his path, coaching, and assisting in any way he can. He was the Assistant Store Manager of service (I Know they changed the titles after the new CEO)  He made me believe what we were doing, We were both all in on the vision for the future.  The GM of the store, however, was the complete opposite. He faked his positive attitude so bad, it was to obvious.  He focused on working everyone to the breaking point, underpaid most of his employees.  It wasn't till I found out one of our employees was going to get a promotion to my position.  This is when I found out our branch was not paying the work we did fairly.  New guy, fraction of the experience, no college, worked a few months, interviewed at a store up the road.  His starting offer was $5.00 more an hour than we were making.  That hurt me, but my other Service managers with way more experience were truly hurt.  I would go back on 2 conditions, that GM isn't there, and my ASM is the GM"
good,"They can legally make you work 9 days in a row without a day off for part time or full time even though part time employees don't get the benefits, but they'll get the hours. They've gotten rid of so many jobs and added duties onto other employees to do even though there isn't enough staff already to take care of everything like it needs to be."
good,Most of the staff was okay to work around and friendly. My supervisor was awesome and very understanding of my issues and worked with me so I was able to keep my job even though I had a hard time attending. Other members of staff liked drama and were absolutely rude to one another and everyone else and didn't even help customers most of the time. Pay wasn't the greatest either especially because they do not offer a night shift differential or any extra money for being able to run the power equipment.
good,A typical day at Lowes consist of resetting bays and organizing products so that customers are able to shop with ease. On a daily basis you are met with customer issues and concerns and have to handle them efficiently as possible.
good,The job itself is a very nice job just being able to get along with the people who are in charge it's the hard part. You have to be able to focus on what you trying to do on most jobs today because there is always somebody in place to make your job as miserable as they can so you have to focus on what you trying to do and accomplish.
good,It has potential to be a great place to work. Difficult to get everyone on the same page and working together as a team. If you work hard then you'll be rewarded with impossible task.
good,Hardworkers get ignored and passed up for advancement when new people with no qualifications land the position you've applied for 3x. I would assume it's discrimination at this point but I haven't been able to trigger it. The point system for interviews is a joke. Experience should be #1 bottom line.
good,"Had a really good full time work schedule with solid pay. Was fired after one safety violation. Wasn‚Äôt given a warning. Wasn‚Äôt given a drug test. Management can be a little too cliquey. If you‚Äôre not full time your hours are all over the place. The rotation schedule is bonkers. 6 days on, one day off, 5 days on, one day off, four days on, one day off, 3 on 2 off a couple times in a row then your month resets. Silly"
good,"You have to get along with everyone."
good,I loved working with customers on home projects. It became tough when the store cut back labor hours and managers like me were forced to cover alot more of the store than before.
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Discounts on products are helpful."
good,"I started out in the Paint Department.  Spent a 100% of my time following a team member to learn the art of mixing paints.  This took me about 3 months to be able to help with customer requests on my own.  While helping customers, I worked on stocking and learning how to use a mechanical lift machine.  Within a month, I took a test and passed to be able to use the mechanical lift machine on a daily basis.  Only saw and talked with management every couple of days or so.  The hardest part of the job is the paint mixing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team members."
good,"You have to be on the in crowd to be able to advance at Lowe's, not too mention the managers don't care about anything and barley ever leave there desk to help. They have poor attitudes if you ask about something you don't know. The pay is at the lowest and with corporate doing cuts you never know if your job is next. It's stressful because no one seems to care anymore. The co workers are okay, but some are just as bad."
good,Totally unorganized. Poor management. Click based environment. Good pay and benefits. Hard to advance if you aren't in with the cool kids. Little to no recognition
good,I was a overnight stocker and around the time I came in the company was going through a transition period. We would get trucks and have no idea how items were in them.
good,"I've been with the company for approximately 18 months. I have been promoted 3 times during that period. I'm grateful for the opportunities Lowe's has provided. The company is under new leadership and there is significant work underway to re-brand and strengthen Lowe's branding / image, technology, and financials. There are growing pains right now. But I do believe the company is quickly positioning themselves for significant growth in the coming years. Plenty of potential for advancement."
good,"The management style is finger pointing. THere was only one competent manager who moved out of state."
good,"Currently in a big transition phase, too many players of feckless managers that are to detached from the business to be effective. I hope the ship gets turned around soon."
good,I worked for Lowe's mostly happily until my position was eliminated with zero notice. It was not a local decision but made to create shareholder profits. I was offered any position in the store if I chose to apply but would forfeit any seniority or benefits I had accumulated and would be starting at zero.
good,"There was an expectation that all employees give 110% with no recognition, training, support or advancement. Policies and procedures were inconsistent and not enforced."
good,It was a good company until they hired the new ceo now there loosing a lot of great workers so the company can make more profits for the bosses at the top
good,Would not work for them again. Poor Leadership CEO trying to make Lowe's into another Home Depot. Changing the culture of Lowe's into some place you would not want to work.
good,"-Great pay and some great people."
good,"Like the work I did , only problem to me was training people about every week.Mostly youngsters no work ethic, cry babies HR baby them.And the Lowe's I was at The HR was VERY Bias."
good,"No matter how hard you work advancement does not happen, it‚Äôs fast pace, very few hours and pay does not meet the equivalent of all the work you do for the company."
good,"The job can be stressful especially if you have never worked in a home improvement store or retail before. There is very little training starting out. You will find associates willing to help with tasks and orders, but it is short staffed, so help can be hard to find at times."
good,Did not help employees when needed Trustee work employees to the ground management and ask like employees oh them something at all times 50% a time management does not care if you exist and do not think that your job is that important
good,"Typical days are making sure the department is clean and the product is stocked, along with helping any customers with any questions they may have. We tend to be low on staff and have to help out neighboring departments when we were very low on staff. Going from building materials to tools, plumbing, and hardware. Management was a bit rough but we did get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow coworkers because the majority of the people that you work with on the floor were more than willing to help you. Because of that, the work environment was pretty good, even on bad days. Working at Lowes helped me with customer service building and get forklift driving skills up. I went from driving a bit slow to driving fairly quickly and with no issue when it came to loading and unloading flatbed trucks."
good,"Working outside in the elements is the hardest. A lot of heavy lifting. No family life- you work their schedule or not at all- if you get full time. Part time is more flexible but, not much."
good,"Between the incompetence of management, the lack of communication from anyone, the uneven wages given to people performing the same job, the schedule that changes at least twice a week, and the complete lack of training, I cannot comfortably recommend Lowe's to anyone."
good,"Lowe's an alright place to work. The major issue is the schedule inconsistency and the Part-Time fulfillment options are nonexistent. Best Buy has a part time fulfillment of 5x Morning or Closing Shifts, or weekends (Friday - Monday)."
good,"The workload for business and practices are extremely lackluster, and the company needs to find a more ethical way to keep employees. Overall, it's the same as any other company. It depends on who you are as a person. Don't expect anything super flashy or exciting, but if you need money and work experience then I would suggest giving Lowe's a shot."
good,During my time at there I was able to meet a number of amazing associates and customers. Had a great experience with a amazing associates but management seems lost and absent.
good,"With in my position I problem solved customer issues all day, everyday. After being in that position, I had the confidence to move up in the company. Hardest part was working with the associates who were never disciplined for being lazy. I wanted to become part of management to build a better work environment. I wanted to motivate others. It was frustrating working under a management team that couldn‚Äôt create a better sales team."
good,Lowes was a great company to work for.  I really enjoyed my time with them.  They have quick advancement opportunities and always try their best to work around your schedule.
good,"Lowe's is great for those wanting to push themselves further...benefits and pay are above average! Management is lacking as far as communication goes, often little to no notice when changes take place."
good,Not enough hours slow sometimes but during summer and spring very busy hours pick up and no one wants to work management was all about credit and whoever got the most was favored
good,"Little to no organization on the day to day job. There is no longer an HR person on site and it has proven to be near impossible to get anything done, such as changing your schedule or getting days off. The delivery job is dangerous and requires a lot of heavy lifting, such as 200-500 pound items, by hand, with a partner."
good,Cool place to work to exercise your talents. Compensation could be better. The incentive program needs a complete overhaul. Would love to see more training and growth promoted.
good,Overall a good place to work. Sometimes the decisions that are made don't make sense. For instance they preach customer service but then don't staff enough people to provide that service.
good,This job requires a lot more work then most would think. It is a lot of stocking and down stocking. It is not a set schedule and you work crazy hours.
good,"Its a good company , but they do not care a lot about the employees, they care more to earn money, that to give the employees what they really need..."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes,would have stayed,except I was only interrested in part time,insted I was ask to work 50 to 60 hours a week.when I ask to get less hours, I was told that at the time it was not possible."
good,"Needs better management. Listen to your employees, they have opinions and feelings too.  look into the management. ask the employees how they feel about their store."
good,I haven't worked here in 15 years. My views and opinions are probably useless. I would prefer not to make an actual comment. Still twenty characters to go.
good,"Load appliances and do delivery to customer's home."
good,"No performance appraisals, no annual increase.   Starting pay is  decent but not much room to grow from there.. Little to know recognition for a job well done.   Work like a mule.. its never enough.    N9 smoking on property.  Hard to get breaks.  Management is so busy.  you cant get  them to stop for help on anything.  Its a sink or swim environment!"
good,They are good people there but they have there favors. They take advantage of you and they talk to you any kind of way . Great money but poor management
good,Some days were boring because there just aren't enough customers and then out of nowhere you're so busy that you can't keep up and have to page for backup.
good,great company to work for. Wish they paid employees better so they would stick around longer. More help with management would be nice. Would be nice to pay employees what they're worth.
good,Can be a good job.  Pays well.  Bad management is one of the biggest headaches you will face.  Not enough scheduled help and you are expected to do more than you possibly can.
good,Decent place. Good people but management is numbers only. No associate culture. No advancement I. The same store. You have to move to another. Job roles change after you‚Äôre hired too.
good,People are super friendly but the management was unwilling to work with my priorities outside of work. The management treated you like you were just a piece of meat.
good,"Busy which is nice , the hardest part of working there is the constant start time changing.  The new people that are hired make more money than those of us that are already there.  I like thanking the veterans for their service after they receive their discount."
good,The people were great amd my cp workers awesome the management not great but I would still recommend working there.  The pay was decent and discounts were good
good,"Being the first hardware store I worked you gain a good amount of knowledge about product and functionality, it was for the most part positive experience, but their advancement process from personal experience takes a longer than necessary amount of time."
good,I am a 100 percent customer focused .being around customers and tools and hardware is a real joy for me. I realize this is not for everyone but it works well for me.
good,"You can be scheduled for hours anywhere from 7am-11 pm.  The working conditions depend on the store.  Waynesville, NC store was amazing to work at.  Easley, SC stunk!!  Easley was because there was an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude in general among management and employees..."
good,"Lowes has been and is providing me with an income and job for over 13 years now. That said, the infrastructure need a a lot of help. We use numerous programs that have lots of limitations which doesn't always make the job easier. Most programs do not communicate with one another making certain tasks tedious and clumsy to execute. The training on these programs is non existent . You must be willing to be in charge of your own development. If you put forth the effort you have more opportunity and never be afraid sto say yes to learning something new as it WILL benefit you in the future. You can only become experienced by learning so ensure you take every opportunity to learn something new or challenge yourself to learn something you didn't know the day before. You will go far if you have that mindset and be a valuable asset to the company."
good,A day in the plumbing department was usually pretty hectic. Was always underemployed and everyone dreaded the store manager coming in. As for the sales specalist it really depended on who it was and what department. Some were really cool and nice. Others wanted you to do every single thing for them so they can focus on sales but never were a team player even when they had more than enough downtime.Managers are cool at first but a lot of them treat you as just another number to use you to help them move up the career ladder. Some stores are better then others just like some departments/people are better then others. Not bad for a temporary job or going to school but not a very good long term job. You can do so much better. Especially if you are in a department. Should just go for the same type of job out in the field and make so much more.
good,"Staffing was constantly under what was needed.  Management wasn't readily available and when they were, they didn't back up their employees.  Employees were required to work hours not scheduled and not notified."
good,"They get rid of dept supervisors just to bring them back 2 years later. They get rid of HR, so you can't get answers (800 number can't get to a real person, or 2 different people on the phone give you different answers). Management is inconsistent."
good,Not the best working environment. Too physically demanding in some area without a lot of support when you need it. Felt like I was taken advantage of a lot of the time because of my age.
good,"I was not given the appropriate materials I needed to do my job, such as capable workers. Most of the managers were helpful but did not understand the pressure I was under working many more hours than I asked for and going to school."
good,"My Management level was eliminated in 2018, so as to weed out higher paid positions, to be rehired later at a lower pay scale, allowing for stock pricing to rise, totally disregarded anything to do with advancement of my level, and my work ethic and dedication meant nothing after 10 yrs of service"
good,"At first I enjoyed working at Lowe's but as it went on and more problems arose such as pay raises or opportunities to be promoted I quickly lost interest in working there. Management is poor and a lot needs to be done before the store is in pristine condition."
good,All if my experiences is going to be from the one store I was able to work at. I have talked to people that worked at other stores and most have had a better experience.
good,"A customer comes up to the counter with a color chip from their house. They look a little discouraged. They are having a hard time trying to eyeball match the color. With my color matching matching, I can scan their piece and it will give me the formula to match the color. They pick what product they want the color to be made in and the sheen. I mix it and when i show them how it turns out. They are in awe on how well it matches their piece. I could be having a bad day, but helping someone get the color they have been trying so hard to get brightens my to the tenth degree."
good,"Lowe's is not a good company to work for, poor management and very little chance for advancement. Management would prefer to hire new people instead of giving positions to valuable employees."
good,"Lowes provides good benefits, but the stress of poor communication and staffing takes its toll on employees. Seasoned employees claim the benefits of being an employee now are much lower than the past."
good,Good company to work for. Lots of advancement opportunities at every level. Customer focused workforce. Team atmosphere. New management focused on change and improvement.
good,"I did not work at Lowes long, but while I did work there it was a nice work enviornment. Typically the days were busy and if your department was slow then usually you would be stocking or helping another department. Always kept busy, and on task. They didnt allow for many breaks. Staff was very friendly and willing to help if anyone needed assistance."
good,Work as overnight stocking member. Store has to much product that it falls of the back of shelves. The over stock product gets put on over stock shelves above when product gets low or runs out they order more instead of using the over stock above. Also day crews put product in wrong spot which makes overnight stocking harder. System is just totally messed up.
good,Didn't like the communication in the place so streessful all I did was water the plants that's all I did all day management is a joke if you try to say what's on your mind no feed back most enjoyable was oh there was no enjoying this job
good,"being Short staffed, management not always supporting staff."
good,It's ok but seems no matter how hard you try it's never good enough always wanting more under staffed on departments always cutting hours not enough time in the day to get the job they want done.
good,Fun fast pace with a lot of interaction with the public. Part time work is not dependable and is not enough income to live off of you will have to a second job.
good,"Early starts and late finish on average"
good,"Overall the job as a cashier is boring, but customer service is more interesting for the front end. I have learned a lot when it comes to retail. The amount of patience someone has to have is enormous. Coworkers are nice and friendly but tend to start drama. Hardest part of the job at customer service is dealing with the really difficult customers, and I would say I encounter about 2-3 a day. Great company to work for but could be improved/better. Management is a hit or miss on whether they'll help you or not."
good,"Lowe's would be a good place to work part time but what they pay isn't enough to live on. The management isn't the best, they don't communicate with each other making it difficult for us because one manager will say one thing and hear a totally different thing from another manager."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work most of the time. we have a struggle with the store manager not keeping his word and micro manages. aside from this the job is a great place to work. I have learned that in this company you can move from store to store very easy in case you ever move away. The people who work the floor are wonderful people and are very helpful. I like the time I spend with each customer because I like to help them love where they live.
good,"working at Lowe's can be very stressful but other times it can be relaxing. as a cashier/customer service associate i deal with almost every customer that walks into the building, happy or not. I've learned a lot of talking skills with working customer service. management, store manager barely knows my name, worked in the same store for three years, other managers don't communicate with each other, all have different rules. hardest part of my job is having to try to help angry customers when other associates refuse to. what i enjoy most about my job is most of the people i work with and appreciative customers"
good,"Lowe's is a good hardware store they sell a wide variety of products and most of the staff are amazing."
good,Great people to work with management has no clue. They pay managers 30000 to run there stores. Pay is a joke you can't buy stocks or do 401k after taxes your broke.
good,"At the current moment I have no other comments, opinions, or thoughts regarding Lowe's Home Improvement. I enjoy the people who I work with. Outside of that, I am open to a face to face discussion regarding the particulars on Lowe's Home Improvement."
good,"Coworkers are pretty sassy and stuck up. It‚Äôs hard to fit in on the front end with everyone constantly judging you. But the people you pass on the floor to clock in are friendly and approachable. Management or supervisors are really stuck up. Every conversation I tried to have with them was immediately shut down. The supervisors and managers like to hang out and socialize on the job in the training or break room. Even in the floor or in the offices. If you forward a call from the service desk, they often don‚Äôt answer. So you end up with angry customers, and don‚Äôt bring that up to them, because it ends in management being upset with YOU for even sending the call that the customers requested??? Coworkers talk a lot too. Seems like there‚Äôs never ending drama. Always hearing about what someone said to someone else about you. It‚Äôs draining really but the pay was worth it. Honestly I went home crying A LOT. sorry not sorry for the brutal truth. Oh not to mention I was told I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo pleasant to be around‚Äù ok sorry for performing my very best having a customer service position lol."
good,"Difficult accessing product for customer, they get mad,  difficult keeping employees, it‚Äôs a physically hard on your body. "
good,"Lowe's is great. I liked everything about it except for the managers. They're zombies. They walk around with a grimace almost all the time. The managers back bite each other to employees, especially one particular manager who was weird a lot of the time. She would talk about every other dept & manager & when I told her everyone was trying their best, she got annoyed &she took it personally. Very weird woman."
good,Worked with a lot of great people and learned a great deal about Home Improvement. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of this job is seeing my projects come to life in store and working cross- functionally with both internal and external parties.
good,"You know your scheulde 17 days out, but you can close one night and open the next morning.  If you need to change, YOU have to find someone to cover your shift. The customers are always right and mangement will not stick up for the employees.  And that certain ""click"" gets to do whatever they want, from coming in late, to leaving early, to taking extended lunch breaks and multiple breaks during the day."
good,"Management telling you something and another manager telling you to do something else while you are trying to complete what the other manager told you to do."
good,Bias towards women in management. Very discouraging experience working there. I've worked there over 6 years. A lot of good times but alot more bad times...... maybe it depends on the store
good,"A typical day at this job involved going in at 4 am, unloading the truck, stocking merchandise, making keys and rekeying locks, and customer service as needed.  The work environment is stressful but overall, not a terrible place to work."
good,I don't think it's Lowes in general but the 2 years I've spent within this company has not been great. My store alone last year had a 102% turnover rate and I've seen at least 2 store manager changes. That in itself says it all. May not be the company as a whole but my store as a single unit.
good,"Horrible schedule. Above average benefits and compensation for the industry. No work life balance whatsoever. If youre ok with having to work 1pm to 10pm and then come back at 8am the next day, this is the job for you."
good,"Sometimes, it felt like pulling teeth trying to ask my coworkers and managers for help, who were either reluctant or didn't know how to help. Managers also don't like when employees plan vacations in the summer (since they're already shorthanded) and they may not be guaranteed. I don't know about other locations, but my experience at my location did not go well."
good,You get way too busy at the cash register checking people out and you get no help from any other employees when you have an extremely long line. Rude and degrading management.
good,The warehouse manager was only there for less than a year and made lots of drastic changes to the warehouse  that affected many of the employees lifes.
good,Training was limited. Several Supervisors and Managers were impatient and degrading to new people in training. Reprimanded loudly for following the incorrect direction of my head cashier.
good,"This store had drama and favoritism when I worked there. I was offered a CDL driving position and pay quote by my dept. mgr. for a delivery driving job being advertised."
good,"was ok to work there, but could not balance home-work life,  was working early in morning some days, some days would work till 11pm, and was not constant"
good,you have good benefits but don't expect raises or for any advancement. the management is always looking at you. Lots of time they do not schedule enough people to work the departments and they tend to cut hours frequently.
good,I was not the bread winner so I didn't mind working for a place that didn't pay much. I did love the project coordinator job. I loved watching people pick out materials for a new bathroom or a kitchen.
good,"The best part of the job is co-workers, benefits, and the work-life balance. The worst part is management at times. They except way too much out of one person."
good,Lowe‚Äôs is an alright company to work. It‚Äôs a perfect job for someone in college or high school who‚Äôs wants a decent paying job to get on their feet and is hands down a great first job for anybody. As a career? Do not recommend. Very flexible hours and decent pay for a non-degree job.
good,"Started out as a great place to work, then the company lost sight of how important their employees are. They are after the dollar and they do not care about the people who make the company run."
good,"Good place to hone customer service skills. Feedback is consistent and constructive. Advancement opportunities are given first to employees based on personal preference of management instead of employee performance and motivation. Metrics are easy to achieve, mostly a fun place to work."
good,i had a great time working for lowes and i learned a lot i wish to work there again one day but i was young and dumb before and wasn't a great employee so i was i could get another chance
good,"The place wasn't bad however there are crazy levels of turn over. People would come and go within weeks of being hired. The environment was fine however, many associates would call out. Great people working there."
good,"I liked working there at first but if you aren't lucky enough to get a position with fixed hours you end up working days and nights all throughout the week...tough on your body to work early morning one day, late night the next."
good,"I am retired and this was job for mad-money and to keep me in shape.   Sadly, for a store with great product lines, it still was a typical retail career in the sea of retail companies.   Low pay while dealing with unappreciative customers and sometimes unapreciative supers.   But humanity has plenty of good people and LOWES hires many of them unlike some retail shops.   Truly enjoyed many of my co-workers; some of the best I have ever worked with including my years in building rockets and planes."
good,Many on going changes have occurred within the past several years and it used to be a great company to work for.  Perhaps it will be again in the future
good,"The problem with my experience at Lowes, was not Lowes. I've heard a lot of positive things about the company itself, I think the issue was my location and my set of managers. They didn't really care what the front ends problems were, they never helped us, and whenever we needed them most they were never around."
good,Poor Treatment on first line salaried leaders.  Good treatment of hourlet leaders at the distribution center.  Too much politics and and not enough of following policies.
good,The best part of working here was the flexible work hours and having my own office without much added pressures. Employees were great from my experience
good,"Lowe's schedules their exempt workforce between 50 and 55 hours per week.  Then the management frowns when the person leaves on time, calling them a clock watcher.  Not really big on work/life balance.  Over the past 5 years, they have reduced or eliminated company perks or bonuses."
good,Lowes is trying to give 100% customer service with 40% personnel to do it with. The place great importance on running to meet customers when the push the attention button but most of the time there is no one there to help the customer. The have cut hours to save money even when corporate direction is to increase hours.
good,"Helping people find what they are looking for, even when they don't know what they are looking for. Learning all the product to sell. Extra hours over the holidays"
good,"Unless you are a salaried manager who wants know set schedule with little help from upper managmenet, not a career job for anyone.  Great for college kids or hight school kids looking for part time work."
good,Typical day at work consists of attempting to balance multiple daily and weekly tasks. I have learned a lot about retail business. The hardest part of the job is finding time and guidance on tasks.
good,Poor staffing with schedules.  I really enjoy interacting with customers on their problems  and achieving complete satisfaction when they leave.  Too many departments to cover with few people.
good,they make woke hard on everybody else that works there. and wont listen to employees when they have suggestions. other than that i didn't hate the job.
good,The people are very helpful and friendly. This job helps learning about new products/ how they work and also new tools. There are sufficient breaks provided in all shifts.
good,Job is great for college students who need a little extra income. Not great for people who need a steady income. hours fluctuate to much and people constantly call off leaving you short handed.
good,"Lowes is a great company but differs greatly between regions. The south florida market is horrible for overtime and career advancement. Do not recommend working down here. Up north, in the NY/NJ area, it is excellent."
good,By nature i am pro-active and ready for today's challenge.Everyday present's itself with different challenges for which I'm always looking foward to conquer.
good,"I learned a lot working for this company but one of many down sides is no one is willing to teach anyone as they are afraid of lessening their value to the company, advancement is virtually impossible unless some one dies or is fired and they rarely fire any one, etc ..."
good,I was responsible for setting all the displays throughout the store according to latest planograms. I received a list of directives from corporate on Monday and had to complete all projects in the allotted time frame. The goal was to enhance the displays and product lines to entice customers and increase overall sales.
good,Working at Lowes has helped me in a good amount of ways. One that stands out in particular is my confidence. The experience I have gathered has shown me that I can reach for more if I just strive for it. So with a new honest and eager attitude I can say goodbye and thank you to Lowes as I look for something else that embodies what I learned.
good,"Pros would be you get paid well for a basic bottom of the chain job. They offer good benefits and accruals for paid time off and vacation and what not. I feel though you end up doing a lot of work for what your still paid for. Cons are that management sucks. They don't communicate so you will get a million different answers and different plans on what to do. If you need help on the floor, you wont get it. You are on your own. You definitely learn a lot though."
good,"I transferred to the Lowe's in Tarboro about 5 months ago, and I've regretted    it since. I am a Head Cashier there. I'm constantly being watched and critiqued over small things, things that they don't even do. I have not received any positive feedback since I've been employed there, but Management expects me to provide positive feedback to my cashiers. Hypocrisy right? Lowe's overall is a great company to work for, but the management there really sucks."
good,"I was discriminated against at Lowes because of my age. There was no chance of advancement in the company for this reason. My background, education or experience was irrelevant concerning advanced job placement."
good,There is too much to say but I will say that working here was fun at times but mostly very labor intensive hours were not stable. Low morale and poorly managed by untrained people.
good,"very busy, yet very understaffed. good summer job, a lot of hours. wouldn't recommend working during the fall/winter if looking for stable hours. demanding job."
good,"Promise you the world and deliver absolutely nothing. If you're good at hiding and doing nothing all day but watching you tube, you can apply to be a manager."
good,"If the store manager does not personally like you, he will find a reason to get rid of you.  Regardless of your job performance.  The store employees are generally good to work with.  Poor Senior Management."
good,"I worked here for 5 years and was treated unfairly  HR did not care about any of their employees and neither did their managers, Used to be my favorite place to work, but left for personal reasons"
good,n/a not interested because this is useless and I don't think the lowes I worked at is the same as others I think the store I worked out is different because it was primier store
good,This company strongly stands out from other box stores of its kind with its customer service.  It is encouraged from the top down to ensure customers are taken care of.
good,an employee is just a number. If the Store manager wants to get rid of an employee they will.  No matter how hard you work no recognition and no accountability for employees who do not perform.
good,They continued to hire outside of the company. Management treated us like ugly stepchildren. Terrible management team. Never gave anyone in lower management a chance to state opinions or new ideas. We were left out of all of the meetings.
good,"The store is very understaffed. It is common to cover 2-3 departments alone. The pay does not seem to reflect what a knowledgeable, professional with a high work ethic covering several departments should be compensated. There does not seem to be a lot of opportunity for advancement. It could be a great place to work if it were not because of this. All jobs have their advantages and disadvantages. But you have to be able to afford where you live to be able to ""Love where you live""! Honestly, I enjoy working at Lowe's, I have many great co-workers and I honestly learn something new every day, weather it be from an employee or a customer. I love that I get to continue to learn. I enjoy the challenges of helping customers figure out their oddest projects, and finding that special hard to find item. Even diffusing the difficult customer having them leave a satisfied customer. I say I approve of Lowe's CEO but honestly he is new and I don't really know much about him. Your ALWAYS going to have pros and cons anywhere you work, the pro's would outweigh the con's if the compensation was better."
good,"This was a part-time job for me, the amount of hours worked was hard on me after working a full job Mon-Friday.    But for a part-time job the money was good."
good,I feel like I‚Äôm under compensated for what I have to do  haven‚Äôt been happy for a wile. Managers are nice when your not working but power tripping when they talk to you.
good,"I love the people I work with, and I love my pay but.."
good,could use a refresher course in hospitality and courteous behavior and friendly positive attitudes. Other than that the floor staff is helpful and courteous.
good,There are really was no advancement opportunities especially within management.  The company has restructured and continues to eliminate positions.  Employee morale is at a all time low.
good,"Like most jobs, your immediate coworkers and management can make or break an experience. For me, working for Lowe's as a company was a good experience, competitive pay for the field, good benefits and my coworkers made the experience that much more enjoyable. However, the upper management team at my final location severely tarnished my views of working at Lowe's. From minimal support to condescending reviews to unreasonable requests and expectations, they made my final months at Lowe's quite uncomfortable and tarnished an otherwise good experience."
good,It was a fast paced place to work. You always try to stay busy. Managers were not that great. Not a lot of opportunity to move up in the company as well. Co-workers I worked with were great.
good,"The company keeps doing restructures and layoffs, enough said. Work here if it's all you can get I suppose but other than that keep looking they don't pay well even their managers got laid off and salary cuts. I am entry level and make more than their department managers at my current job."
good,every 2-3 years the fire their dept managers and put 1 person over 3 depts. a year or 2 later they see their mistake and hire dept managers. 2 years later the cycle repeats.
good,I learned how to develop accounts by forecasting client needs based on past purchases. My position as a Commercial Contract Sales Associate gave me the opportunity to provide exceptional customer service to local contractors and clients and develop professional relationships for client retention.
good,"Good pay, good benefits, 10% employee discount on any purchases, has horrible full time rotating shifts (only one weekend off a month), lack of coverage can prove to be extra stressful,"
good,Productivity and growth but not enough hours for the employees. Part timer should be allowed sick pay and the same type of benefits as the full timer.
good,"The employees at Lowes were the saving grace. There were a lot of policies I strongly disagreed with but you get to pet dogs and everyone is pretty genuine."
good,"If you need a job, then I‚Äôd recommend it. That was one of the best paying jobs that I had. However, the environment wasn‚Äôt very great. I felt like everyone was kinda two-faced, trying to do the least that they could while maintaining a job, and not caring about their co-workers. Like I said, if you need a paycheck, do it. But just know what you‚Äôre getting into."
good,"Lowes is moving in the right direction. It has been many years of running behind the times. With Marvin Ellison at the helm, Lowes will move in a much better direction"
good,once you learn the products (it wont be quick) it should be easy most customers look for similar items. some departments are very busy so its a high turnover rate but if you work you should be able to handle it
good,Have no appreciation for their employees. Management is rude treats employees like children. Leaves one employee to accomplish jobs of 3 and does not hold the other employees accountable for not doing their jobs
good,The hardest part about working at Lowes would be the weather. I worked in the garden center so in the summer it was hot and in the winter it was freezing. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting different people and learning as you work.
good,"Lowe's Home Center is fine for low ambition employees who don't want change much.  Populated by tradesmen.  Retail experience there is typical."
good,the job is okay very stressful and you don't get any help when you work at the customer service desk. They pay people more to stand at the door and watch people than they do that actually do most of the work.
good,"Most employees have to work rotating shifts covering 5:30AM to 11:00PM, every day including weekends. No one can really have a home life with this schedule. I was fortunate to have a fixed schedule for many years, with no weekends. That changed this year when they forced me to work overnights on and off. That was a horrible experience with no end in sight. That is why I am leaving."
good,"This place was good to work at, Hours were long at 10 per day but 4 day week. It was a long drive (1 hr 15 min from Tim Hortons field Hamilton) easy work and time flew by"
good,"Good company that seems to always want to see what they can do better for their employees, and a good wage for a part time job.  No room to advance to full time or get additional hours."
good,"I loved the people I worked with but the management is was all over, hours were inconsistent and there was no room to move up. The pay was very good for a starting position but it's not always worth the energy required for the job."
good,"It's a retail job, it's about what anyone can expect. Customer service, stocking products, cleaning up. Hardest part of my job was spending all day under the sun loading pine straw and/or mulch into vehicles."
good,"This is my first experience with retail sales. The hardest part of the job is low hourly pay, and poor work schedule. Do not like working weekends or evenings."
good,"Operate Returns desk or Customer service, answer questions and direct customers to what they are looking for. Dealing with stressful situations. Very irregular schedule"
good,"Enough is never enough at Lowe's. No matter how much you accomplished in your department, they always wanted more. I worked twenty six hours straight one time and was chastised for not completing one task."
good,"Great folks work there.  Good customers.  Hard work, little praise."
good,The store and department I was in had a very high turnover rate and management did very little to alleviate the problems we faced in store. In the delivery department we work long hours and have little to none job security.
good,The  hardest part of job was the graveyard shift and I could not get that changed. The managers changed frequently. Smoking was not allowed. There was always stock to put away every night and trucks to unload
good,Lowe's was not a good place to work. Long hours and not family oriented. Hard to have a life outside of Lowe's based on the hours. I learned how to deal with the public.
good,"Never had the same shift two days in a row. Never knew where I would be working in the store, did not have scheduled breaks. Very low morale among employees>"
good,"You have to be in the ""click"" in order to get anywhere. They help you only when they want something. As long as it benefits them. They dont train very well,they will throw you out to the dogs and hope for the best."
good,My review for  lowes is it is a good opportunity for people with experience in hardware departments and forklift and pallet jack experience. I enjoyed my time being employed at lowes I was trained right and when oppurtunity came I was able to move into a position I applied for.
good,"I have been in the department for over 10 years so i have met many contractors who would only deal with me.. I had my own desk with all their folders in it to take care of all parts of their projects, I have learned alot about all aspects of the contracting industries plus I dealt with alot of home owners who always came to me if they needed help with anything.. I knew the store front to back side to side.. I have had 6 store manager in 10 years which one passed away and my immediate boss had 2 heart attacks due to the pressure they put on them,Talking to the management team no one listened and just brushed it under the rug so that was frustrating.. The culture was every walk of life and i didn't care if they had a million dollars or 10 I treated them the same way. .I loved researching for my department if someone said we don't have it i would try my best to find it.. I loved what i did and I have a outstanding personality .. I have a reference page 25 people long.."
good,"It is an alright place to work, considering the poor management inside the store. Workload was heavy and the man-power to complete projects and tasks, were very low. I would go back and work here if the pay was better and the management cared."
good,I just feel that it is time for a change and I won‚Äôt to get back doing something I really love to do.  I would love working for a company that your work ethics speaks for all the things you can do
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is my customers and some of my friends I made working at Lowe's. Seeing my same customers every day makes my day. Also our customers brings in their dogs in just to visit us as well.
good,A typical day is helping customers cleaning down stocking ordering online for customers receiving  The store manager is awesome loved working with him the management team has some up's and down's employees in my department are not as ambitious as I am.
good,busy days with not enough staff. never enough products on the shelves. Started as a great place to work but got harder as the full time workers were replaced by part time workers. very little support on the sales floor. Low employee morale.
good,This company was hard to work for. The management was prejudiced against women.  It was a great day when the scum bag I worked under was fired for female harassment.
good,Love the company but be careful in markets that the Market Manager wants to make a name for himself.  If its not Store managers its the Assistant Managers.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. The benefits are excellent and the pay is outstanding. It is the management team that brings down the morale of the store.
good,"Lowe's isn't terrible, but it will never be anyone's dream job by any means. If you're looking for part time work at  Lowe's it is probably the best option. Their scheduling for full time employees is very controlling and restrictive."
good,"Lowe‚Äôs does a great job on hiring people who present good customer service. I enjoy all the people who work there, everyone seems happy and love to help there customers! The only bad thing is when you get a customer and they tend to forget your a normal person just like the rest."
good,"When I started at Lowe's it was the perfect job, I loved everything about it. But then the poor managment started to show through scheduling and un-answered questions. Eventually I knew more than my manager! The job itself is great I loved it. But the gossip and people that work at the Madison Heights Lowe's, its worse than high school. I recommend working at Lowe's. Just not the Madison Heights store."
good,"Long hours, recent GM change should make things better, more fair and less political. HR rep regularly solicited associates to coach and collect 'poor treatment' stories against multiple supervisors for termination, always under the guise of anonymity. "
good,"Diverse employees to work with, plenty of work hours available..  No room for job advancement.  More paid time off for sick and annual needed however."
good,"If you love to be treated like you are not a person and talked down to by management and your human resources person, then this is the place for you. If you're lucky you'll find a good store to work in but you'll never know until you're already in, and then they'll send your manager to a different store and give you a new one who turns your store into one of the no good ones."
good,"Good people come to work for Lowes but fewer of them are staying. The company needs to do more to retain good people. Hire managers that care not only about the company's bottom line, but managers that really take care of the employees."
good,This is an easy call center job. Depending on what department your're in the calls aren't too hard to handle and you rarely get yelled at. There is a very strict attendance policy.
good,"Not enough authority in the hands of on-site management, which creates a feeling that the store is out of control, or the person able to make real changes isn't available to speak with."
good,This is a great job for those in School and looking for a part time/ temporary position. Working in the winter you'll learn how to unload trucks and set-up a Christmas tree sales tent while learning the ins and outs of the in-store work environment.
good,"Other workers were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my time  there. But more money is important."
good,Working here is okay but this store in California MD needs to get their front end together lazy head cashiers and attitudes people up front are always calling out no one gets held accountable  they need to get that fixed cause it interferes with  business people who come to work have to pick up there slack
good,"I was a seasonal to hire, but that never happen. So I work in the lumber department, always on time and always did my job plus others which I didn't mine.I was a closer at lowes come in at 4pm to close. I help with customers from getting lumber to getting concrete loaded in there trucks. I like the job a lot. Our management was on the other hand was terrible. They didn't care about your opinion and when seasonal people were suppose to be getting evaluated our hr gets fired and then managers quit. So all the people we work for were gone and then new hr comes in and cans us all. It was sad that day, but other then that problem at the store lowes is a good place to learn and build knowledge off of for home owning and doing repairs yourself and helping customers on how to handle different situation ."
good,No room for advancement so if you are content on remaining so/so then it is for you. There are lots of different jobs available for many different people. Salary is below national average but you can survive.
good,"Great place to work temporarily. But not a place to work if you are looking for a career unless your management. Or a higher position. And for the hours you work and all of the tasks and duties you are expected to do, you are not paid enough. I worked my butt off for the year I was there and still was only given a small up in pay when I started another position."
good,Lowe use to be a great place to work but over the past few years they have made some changes. The changes involve the management and some employees that a lot of people do not agree with and I am one of them.
good,Not enough focus on productivity from several co workers.  Too much focus on friendships outaide of work by managers instead of focusing in safe work environment and qualoty productivity.
good,Since management change Lowe's is no longer a leader in the home improvement industry.  Lowe's is going to an almost full part time work force and no longer value's experience in their work force.
good,"For those at the beginning or end of a career, will offer a lot of opportunities to learn or ride into the sunset with pay better than average for retail and benefits offered to start with part-time. If you are expecting a career position either prepare for the absence of a life outside of the building or prepare to deal with contradiction and conflict with a hybrid position that doesn't work properly."
good,Good job need better management and training/career development  expects more out of you than what they pay unorganized and needs to upgrade technologies in all areas
good,"There is always something going on at my store which makes the day interesting. Hardest part was trying to keep all the projects organized, work with new clients all while getting interrupted by customers walking through the aisles."
good,Its a decent place to work. My first time working in retail and its been a ok experience.  Managers need to be more involved with the front end and the pay should be more for what is expected of you.
good,"As soon as you punch in you go from 0-100 miles an hour bouncing all over the store putting out fires as they arise with associates and customers. You learn on the fly with an outdated computer system , they throw you a life preserver and say ""welcome to Lowe's"". Workplace culture is a joke. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unorganized  management and a lack of work ethic by majority of the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is that some of the associates are fun to work with and then, you go home."
good,Well a typical day for me revolves around customers. I am a sales specialist now so I help people make decisions about what flooring to choose and write up estimates. I also drive all the forklifts so I can down stock the floor as well.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's were ringing customers items up with different payment methods by cash, credit card or checks. The most enjoyable part of the job were customers complete satisfaction within store the shopping.  I learned you must have patience and be respectful for all customers. The hardest part of the job were unsatisfied customer would explain the different prices posted on selves that depends on bulk purchases. Management can take sensitively classes dealing with their employees."
good,"Management made it harder to enjoy the employment. Was not willing to work with me, catered to other employees that were their friends. though some of the discounted items was nice to get for home"
good,"I worked a few positions throughout the store: FSA, outdoor garden, unloader, and delivery driver. The location I worked at was a smaller store so the place was more relaxed. Decisions made from the higher-ups (store manager and above) weren't always the smartest. Other managers ranged from amazing to woefully inept at their duties. Customers can be nasty here just like the rest of the retail work. Coworkers were nice and friendly and the pay was decent for the work I did. Overall an okay place to work"
good,"The work environment is greatly dependent on your store manager; if you have a good manager and it can be quite enjoyable; have a bad manager and the team spirit vanishes and the negativity goes through the roof.  Chances for advancement has decreased in the past 2 years since they have eliminated about 1/4 of the Assistant managers and then a year later, eliminated almost all department heads.  It also appears that they hire store managers and ASMs from the outside in about 30% of the cases.  At my store we have a good store and HR manager who work hard to generate a productive environment.  While there are shortcomings, I would still recommend Lowe's as a place to work."
good,I worked at Lowe's as a part-time employee at the customer service desk. The pay is decent for a part-time job.  The customers can be very rude. There is blatant favoritism throughout the company. Often times employees will not even be given a chance to interview for a different position because the managers already have their own agendas. The most rewarding experience I was given for my hard work was a larger amount of hours than other part-time employees. I would regularly get around 30 hours a week while others would get closer to twenty or even less in a few cases.
good,Company is decent to work for if you are looking for extra income. Competitive pay rate and increases yearly. Offers benefits to full and part time employees.
good,Very good company. Many opportunities within the job to advance to other positions. Friendly staff with positive workers. Management varies from store to store location.
good,Lowe‚Äôs did have good benefits but they would cut u down to 10 hours a week during the off season. They treated employees poorly and misconduct between managers and employees happened a lot. The environment at Lowes is mainly male driven and its very obvious.
good,I really liked the people I worked with and some of the management.  However the job is very stressful and you have no set hours.  this makes it hard if you want to have any kind of family life.  Management tends to put you second to the business especially when it come to illnesses.
good,it was a grate place to work them they put in new management and got new CEO and things went down hill fast. they would never have the things that were to be delivered and we spent a lot time going to other lowe's stores to get thing that should have been in the store
good,"Although, the pay for delivery driver is an eye opener the job is difficult. It can be hazardous at your expense but it's a good job to get into the distribution or delivery industry"
good,Busy. Great people. Team members are treated very well. Management does the best it can in meeting performance demands. Everyone tries to meet goals and be safe.
good,Lowe's as a good company to work for has really declined over the years. They used to be very employee focused and concerned about the individual. Now they are only focused on the bottom line.
good,"As in most retail jobs, this is a very physical job that requires dealing with the general public. It can be stressful, becuase they budget the stores to have minimal staff on hand at all times. Typically per shift a department will only have one employee. So, for example a shift may be 8am-5pm and there will be 1 person covering flooring or home decor until the next shift starts who is usually the closer who comes in at 1pm. Also, each department is expected to cover their sister department during breaks. If you have a customer in front of you other customers will be angry that there is no one available to help. Typically, the general public don't treat retail employees with much dignity or respect either. When they don't get what they want they bully the employees by yelling until someone gives in at the store and returns their money to them or give them free items or services. The only upside is they tend to pay better than other retailers such as Walmart and Target which typically stay on or close to minimum wage."
good,The people were nice but they work you too many hours for too little pay. The system just doesn't work. They don't focus enough on teaching and customer experience.
good,"I liked working there in the beginning. Once I got hurt things changed drastically. Basically felt like they just wanted n"
good,"would have to re organize all the skids of wood and pull them forward on top of having them evenly stacked. I was quick to pick on the different types of wood so that i could better aid customers on their projects and make sure best customer satisfaction. I also had to operate the cutting machines and branched out to other departments when needed. The overall environment was nice also because i knew some of my colleagues before working there but the hardest part of the job would be when we had to help pick orders because of the size order, overall tho i enjoyed the job because most of the people were really friendly and i learned quite a bit working there."
good,"A typical day at Lowes is Always changing. The co- workers at Lowes are probably the best part they treat you like family . The company believes in helping potential customers ""Love where the live"""
good,There are a lot of great People but there is still a lot of change going on in the company. They are still struggling with the management changes that recently took place.
good,lowes it was a great environment if you needed help you got it. the managers all did their responsibilities and helped you if you needed it  the hardest part of the job was the customers
good,Lowe's has been a great and bad place to work depending on the location and the management running it. The benefits and stock options were great. They are a good company as a whole.
good,"Lowe's isn't ahead of the curve in anything they do. very top heavy, lacks leadership and direction. They expect you to do the work of ten people without compensation. Great starter job due to cuts no room for career advancement nor real diversity until old guard finally retires."
good,"Company standards and culture is amazing however most stores do not follow it, which makes the job stressful. Employee as non-management work can be good if you do as your told and go home. As a manager If most of the management team is on the same page including the store manager then it is great."
good,"Average day at Lowes for my department is your always moving, and always doing something to keep the area clean and organized. Management has gotten to be one of the worst that I have ever worked with. There's not a lot of communication between store manager, ASM's, and employees which can make work difficult as you can imagine. Co-workers are great there. You can only get certain benefits if you are full-time. There isn't a lot of advancement in the company due to management seeing who they want in a position."
good,A lot of employees were very nice. Learned a lot of home improvement skills working there. Learned about customer service and loss prevention as well.
good,"the action or sound of laughing."
good,cashier experience is helpful and customer service is a must. management is pretty decent and scheduling is flexible with second job. pay could be better and the retail environment is unsure
good,Lowe's keeps you on your toes. The managers there are stressed and somewhat take it out on others there. Money is good but could be better. Hours are minimum and aren't guaranteed.
good,"Lowes is a good place for part-time or students. Management has no drive they are there for a paycheck. Lowes does not look out for their employees. The pay is unfair, associates that have been with the company for years are making the same or less than newly hired associates"
good,The work enviroment is not great for those with marginalized identities. There was no HR manager for several months and there were many issues in the work enviroment itself.
good,"Its not that bad, its retail. This was my first job out of high school and I decide to stay and see if I could move up within the company. I was so wrong, the only thing I got was lateral moves and that was it. If you enjoy retail, then apply here."
good,none given
good,"The benefits were good, the retirement stocks were profitable. there were times they treated you like a 16 yr old and this was your first job. the 10% discount was great."
good,"They couldn't put the labels in the right spot so that people could find them. They didn't have many people that work there, everyone was all over the place"
good,"Too Much Stress for no one to care if you work here or not."
good,"Lowes mantra is customer focus and that sounds fine and there is a movement to service customers in a timely manner  some time . Most of time the  expectation on staff to make the profit for the company ie, ask customers if they need anything else warranties on simple products and tools  that don't apply to contractors, most tools and products are of good quality with 4/5 yrs product warranty. who will buy more?"
good,"low pay.  expensive benefits.  constantly changing priorities.  inexperienced management.   say servant leadership, But are not servant leaders.  Good company ,  Pottsville RDC needs work"
good,"Fun place to work, and good people. "
good,Lowe's can be a good place for young people to get started in the work field. If you work hard and follow all the company rules and guidelines it is pretty easy for you to move up in the company
good,Not excited about working part-time there again.  They did not care for their part-time employees and in my view did not promote the employees that gave excellent customer services as they should.
good,"Overnight stocking was: 5 days on/2 days off, hours were 10pm to 7am or till the job was done."
good,Honestly this job was decent for a start up but it began to get stagnant as I personally attempted to advance my position. I was making as much I as needed for life in NY
good,Great for students and someone looking for a little extra income.  Not much opportunity for advancement.  Work schedule is very mixed so it's hard to plan regular activities in your life. Great people to work with but must be a self motivated person.
good,They do not care for their employees and they do not care if they get hurt. They are out to make a number and that is all. They do no want quality the do not want you to be happy or have a good work day.
good,Overall my experience there was fine but my co-workers where not the most productive. also the hours where less then favorable for someone trying to save for college classes.
good,"Not the greatest place to work at. Can be either extremely slow or having angry construction buffs yelling at you."
good,"They are able to work around my school schedule. I am allowed to give them my availability, which they have worked with. I have not been able to move up and the company has been undergoing a lot of changes that are not beneficial, but overall the environment is fine."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes and I enjoyed the people I worked around.  My supervisor was very understanding and motivated me to want more.  I tried to move up in the company but it seemed the opportunity would be declined.  After I received my degree I went to another retailer to advance my career.
good,"Working at Lowe's provides a good social outlet. You make friends with customers and co-workers. There is a lot of movement working here, so it is easier to keep fit."
good,management was horrible the new managers didnt like anyone and don't care what you would do which is a bad thing. So it's a okay place to work at but kinda don't recommend it.
good,Una muy buena empresa para laborar buenas prestaciones de ley y crecimiento
good,"Its a good long term job to have because they have benifits, 401k, paid vacation. Just no raises, the management is no good, the boss and supervisors are all over the place and un-organized. They dont treat their employees with respect."
good,"The pay and benefits are what have kept me at Lowe's as long as I have been there. The reason I want to leave is due to the poor management and dishonesty I've experienced from leadership. There's also not a lot of job security because there's so many people there, you're treated like a number, not a person and numbers can be replaced any time at their convenience."
good,"Lots of part time positions but difficult to move on, there seem to be limited full time positions . When applying to a full time position there is not feed back all of the sudden it's filled and you never hear anything about it."
good,"Lowe's is overall a good company to work for, but it is the management of the store I worked in that is a problem. There is very poor management at this store."
good,"The Job was stressful but fun. I enjoyed helping people and learning the different departments. However we to constantly play fack roles for the upper management, when we should have kept our job together and avoid the fack role. The upper management was very bad. They did not want to take care of the employees and I had to be the one to look bad and hear the problems. The benefits are great and the pay was okay at the time. The bonus is where the competition came in. We had to make it competitive for the employees so everyone could get there bonus, in my department. I enjoyed working her overall but the stress got to bad."
good,if you like retail you will then like this job. i didn't care for the fact that you have to work all different hours all the time. one day you could be working a morning shift the next day you would be working a night shift
good,Wish they had stayed the course of doing the little things right.Feel they are trying too hard to compete with other big box store.Management needs to set a direction and stick to it.
good,"Learned how to drive a forklift, and especially enjoy that part of the job. Use a wall saw for cutting plywood and boards. Self-motivated-good at recognizing work that needs to be done, and doing it. Involved in selling, as well as providing transfer of materials."
good,"hardest part of the job is staying busy in winter seasons"
good,"The job itself was great!! Driving out to customer's houses installing and removing appliances was one of the funnest jobs I have ever had. The thing is though, you would either be working 10-12 hour shifts or 4-6 hour shifts and work the rest in the store. In the store, you felt like an untrained intern, spending most of your time asking other busy employees for help, and honestly wasting customers time by not knowing a thing about anything in the store."
good,"It is an excellent company to work for, however I would recommend anyone to apply directly to the company. Management would personally say ""Have a nice night""."
good,"I worked on the unload team and i was very good at my job, but for some reason when i felt like it was time to try to move up to a better position it seemed like my managers didn't want to find someone to fill my place."
good,Great at giving you expectations but horrible at advancing your career. Is willing to sacrifice your well being for bonuses. Try to keep you at 15 hrs a week in order to save on payroll.  Could care less about long lines and complaining customers and unstaffed departments.
good,Good company to work for.  Hours can be stressful. Depending on the season how many hours you get.  Spring and Summer time you will get your 40 or more hours. Other times you are lucky to get 30 hours a week
good,Can be a great work place or horrible one depending on your manager. Your only real training is initially on the PC and job shadow on the first few days. To get ahead you need to be highly proactive and learn thinks your self. Managers normally do not have the time to making sure you are learning things properly so make sure you ask them.
good,Must be able to deal with difficult customers on a daily basis.  Numerous angry or annoying customers can lead to a bad day.  Very little room for advancement.
good,Nice place to work. Tough retail environment that requires dedication and great leadership skills. Multi-tasking is a must to be successful in any retail location and Lowe's is no different.
good,"Long hours, little to no appreciation, NO WORK LIFE BALANCE for Salaried Managers, but great optional benefits and PTO. Great bunch of dedicated employees."
good,is a good job you keep busy lots of customers mostly friendly steady work I am fulltime seeking the same in my next job Comfortable place to work friendly co workers
good,"Most employees don't like working there. Some  who have been there a long time don't feel like they need to work, while newer employees are lazy.  Most of the time it's just seasonal work, unless you can become management."
good,"Great employees go above and beyond, bad management. Great place for getting fired. They liked to show off who they caned by escorting them out of building."
good,"Typical day at Lowe's was set, making sure the front was Customer ready, pushing charities and products, cards and credit too. the only thing I think needs work is the head cashiers . To me Customer comes first, I believe we should give the Customer "
good,"terrible place"
good,"Typical day at Lowe's would consist of putting up new stock that just came in as well as customer service, along with taking inventory and putting away merchandise. Lowe's is a very competitive work environment. The hardest part of working at Lowe's is managing your customer service along with other task assigned to your area within the store."
good,"Overall it's an okay place to work. If you work overnight, you're just about guaranteed 40 hours but the daytime shift usually fluctuates due to sales production, so if the store sales are up, YOU'RE GOOD, but if sales are low, it's a bad day."
good,"not enough help daily! could use department managers back! sales people could follow up with order management better, have order in stock when time to go. communicate better."
good,"I greeted customers and sold appliances, took care of any customer concerns. I learned that every that every sale had different circumstances That had to be dealt with and met. Management was poor, there was no support to they workers on the floor. "
good,"Work on resets of product"
good,Provided superior customer service.  I learned a lot about plumbing.  Lowes promoted individuals not ready to be promoted.  It's difficult to describe the culture as there were seasoned professionals as well as individuals not suited for that environment.  The hardest part of the job is that customers usually came in to solve an unexpected problem.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in Lawn and Garden.
good,At this job I was never made to feel appreciated. Management made no effort to get to know employees and treated most people as just a number.  Morale is generally low among employees and management is oblivious to this.
good,To many promises to get me to take the job that was false and inaccurate info. They were not honest about the job description and did not take time to listen or even work to find a compromise.
good,"Clean, stock, help customers"
good,"As a delivery driver for Lowe's your hours vary all the time. Although I was scheduled 6-2, it was more like 6 until you finish deliveries which could be noon or 5-7 at night. A lot of other employees (salesmen) will end up screwing something up or just adding deliveries at the last second so even when you thing you will get off close to 1, they can add 3 deliveries that are ""close to the store"" and then your 6 hour day turns into an 11 hour day. On top of that, a lot of the places you deliver to can be quite repulsive and the deliveries themselves are always wild cards. There is no telling what will happen with each one and how long it will take."
good,"typical retail working environment. "
good,It's an okay place to work at. Everything is mostly Customer service. The major downfall to this job is that we aren't allowed to protect ourselves from harm and the hours shift at anytime the managers want.
good,Lowe's reduce management force. Which reduce the number of opportunity to move up in the company. There are not a lot of freedom. Management offer very little support.
good,its a okay place to work for.They just don treat every one the same.It seems as if the company does not car for the safty of there employes.They talk abt being safe but dont inforce it.
good,Management changes frequently so do the co workers. Since I Have started there have been many employees that come and go it has a very high turnover rate.
good,"Its retail- self explanatory for those who had previous retail experience."
good,"6 To 7 hr. Workdays"
good,"Managment is hit or miss. They do not like to approve days off.  Rotated schedule for full time associates was never right.  Loved my co-workers , fun work environment"
good,"Really high paced job dealing with the retail end.  I didn't like having to work a lot of holidays because of the retail end. "
good,Provide customer with a satisfying experience. The hardest part of the job is adapting to a changing hourly schedule. Very little training is provided.
good,"Everything you would expect working for a large, corporate retail store. Duties that do not highly stimulate employees. A false ""we are a family"" corporate message. Not a terrible place to work, not a career."
good,Unloaded freight from regional distribution center. Operated power equipment to aid in the safe transport of heavy and palletized materials. The peopled were the best thing about the job.
good,Maybe it was just my experience but i have never seen a more hopeless management team in my life. Not to mention there was an intense racist vibe in the air what with 95 percent of the store being one race and the sheer amount of underhanded remarks i received while working there.
good,Needs more organization. Large company but not enough workers to work each department. They are not hiring enough people to do the job. They over work good employees.
good,I loved lowes and tjought it was the best company to ever work for now I don't see there ever being a chance to move up and I have interviewed for higher positions but I don't know anyone in the upper level so won't get a spot
good,"loved working in a clean environment, the job was good, management has their favorites and their is lots of gossiping between management to staff and staff to management. which was the hardest part of the job. the best part is most of the staff."
good,"To many chiefs not enough icu and"
good,"Adapting to change and restructure of the company by eliminating jobs within the work force. Down sizing to control expenses, low ability to control inventory to keep up with the demand for customers"
good,Good job for college students and retirees. There is room for growth at the company but the management is the worst. A lot of back stabbing and gossiping.
good,"Enjoyed the job.  It was long hours standing on your feet.  The management at the time I worked there was volatile and unfriendly to employees.  I know management has changed, but I do not know the current environment."
good,Long term associates (if you can stay any amount of time) seem to do better and weed out potentially good employees. Company tends to over promote with no training with mantality of sink or swim!
good,ok  place to be depending on position.company is going down hill they are making alot of new moves but the work force is not responding well need to servey the veiw of the associates more
good,"Hours cut with hardly any notice. Managers are lazy and don't want to help at all. It's easy to advance, but not worth it. Like I said, it's retail. Everyone there is lax about everything and you end up picking all the slack."
good,"I have invested approx 12 years into this company, built myself up to where I was a very business oriented professional... then the company decides to do a restructure and just tosses aside all the tenure and knowledge and replace it with less and less paid individuals thus creating a very hostile and low moral environment.  My job only has several months to continue until I have to move on or take a lower salary position which financially I am not capable of doing.  So I would like to take my talents elsewhere and have them be utilized to help another company in all the ways that I have learned how to."
good,I worked in several stores and they all seemed to have great people working in them. Management seemed to want to help with any issues that arose. The staff never has enough people to help the customer but most employees want to help the customer
good,Lowes new restructure has made it hard to make it through the day. With minimal staff they can no longer provide superior customer service over their competitors.
good,"co-workers are like a family, I learned how to do a managers job but not be a manager. The hardest part of the job was the shift changes.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know so many people.Pay was good for the area."
good,It varied working there.  Some days were good and some days were stressed.  Management is out for themselves and doesn't help employee moral.  When issues pop up management should help the employee out.
good,"Overall, Lowe's is not a bad place to work.  A typical day would require long hours of standing and assisting customers while upholding company standards of customer satisfaction.  I have learned a great deal from the company but I am ready to broaden my horizons and see what else I can learn with my newly acquired education.  The culture has since diminished in the past several years.  Employee engagement is declining and with recent cutbacks reducing the amount of employees on the floor, customer ratings of the company have also declined.  I would have to say the hardest part of my job not having the autonomy to make certain decisions without consulting a manager, and not having the ability to restructure our product bay's to make shopping easier, and more enjoyable to our customer's.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the ability to meet people from all walks of life and dive into their projects head first.  Seeing a customer walk away with products in their hands and a smile on their face is greatly rewarding."
good,"A typical day as a Kitchen Project Specialist consists of beginning the shift with department duties. First thing that is required is completing the daily safety check and filing the report.  If it is a freight day then I am to make sure all product is placed in its proper location and any extra product is topstocked.  Next, we are responsible to complete the Stock Replenishment and submit the report.  I then begin taking care of my Order Management making sure all my customers orders are being taken care of and will be ready as expected by our customers.  This includes phone calls to vendors, customers, distribution centers, etc.  During this time, phone calls, customer service, pulling orders, working on designs for customers and assisting new employees are also being performed as well as keeping the department organized and clean. "
good,"I had fun working in this department from the beginning.  Home improvement was an area that I was not that familiar with, but I picked it up pretty fast. I got along great withe the management staff and was overall happy with the position."
good,"I decided that I wanted to work in a department that would challenge me. The plumbing department of Lowes was just that, challenging!  I really enjoyed learning new aspects of home improvement. The management staff was great to work with."
good,I enjoyed working in the tool and hardware department for a couple different reasons; staff was very supportive of me learning a new department and the manager was very patient with my learning curve of tools.
good,Management at my location was fairly bad; however the job itself was not that bad. I did enjoy that they were able to work around my scheduling for school. Lots of times however I felt that my superiors gave little to no regard for the well being of their employees and would often talk bad about us behind out backs. The job was easy to learn and good for full-time students.
good,"- a typical retail-chain stores/ environment"
good,"The structure and culture of each store is different and depends on how the associates on the floor understands their job(s), willing to work as a team and has supportive management that want to lead not manage, every store is not like that."
good,"Lowe's and the store level associates have amazing potential however under the continued leadership of Niblock, the culture, morale, and job security of the in-store level associate is downward landside all due to Niblock's obsession to increase stock dividends to match Wall Street projections and investor demands at all costs no matter what. "
good,"Not enough hours and no room for advancement. Management wasn't very involved. I helped customers in the lawn maintenance department of the store. In addition, I helped customers load and unload their items."
good,The job itself was fun and relatively easy. My only issue was I lost my job when it became hard to travel 45 min to work after the store was destroyed by a tornado
good,We would work him receiving and get two truckloads of product a night with only three people unloading it and getting it all to each department so instead of it being part time work it turned into long nights and full-time work
good,Good place to work. You will expected to work hard to keep up with things. Management is good to work with when they can keep people. Upper management does need to hold each other accountable
good,"This is a job for people that want to work and engage with customers."
good,"Work with multiple customers daily and whatever is the whim of management."
good,"Fun Job, but needs a major restructure of management. Managers only care about what the company wants and could care less about it's employees. The Company makes it impossible for you to enjoy your life outside of work."
good,"No job security, very stressful. Job is being eliminated is approx. 6 months. Lowes has become very a company that cares more about itself than its employees"
good,"Lowes is a great company for a highschool student with plans to work their way through college. As long as you stay on as part time they will be flexible with your schedule. However, if you want to move up in the company you must have open availability for every day of the week. They take care of their workers with free meals on holidays and for meeting certain company expectations. However, I feel like it is time for me to move on."
good,"Must be ready for anything! Must be ready for any type of customer encounter, positive or negative! Important to show enthusiasm to other employees and customer positive attitude and work through difficult situations that can result in positive employee/customer experience! Must be team player willing to jump in and help out to maximize customer positive experience and employee positive morale! Willing to go that extra mile to expedite anddddd maximize the customer experience! Team player is extremely important!!"
good,I worked for Lowes Distribution for over 10 years had I not relocated with them chances are I may still be there today.  If you have the right boss it is a great place to be but if your boss sucks as mine did the last 3 years there you will want to look for employment elsewhere. Company is overall pretty good but your boss as always can advance your career or hold you back.
good,"When working at Lowes I learned how to do invoices and customer online orders. I was responsible for cash, credit, and check transactions, assisting customers, and making sure that my work area remained clean and safe."
good,I was given all the opportunity for advancement I wanted. I was encouraged to move up and try different roles as a manager. Inconsistency in locations and management staff made it hard to find an even ground to set standards. Very competitive atmosphere always made me strive for the next best things. Goals were often lost and over shadowed by something new sometimes in the same day.
good,"I have no opinion I do not have any opinion why is this required I have no reason to say anything this is harrasment by indeed to require this, good bye"
good,Lowes use to be a top tier company where you can develop skills in sales and management. Since the company restructure it basically a stressful environment with little help. Majority of your time and life is consumed by the store if your in management.
good,Lowes used to be a great company somewhere i wanted to work however the restructure their in no such thing as teamwork. There is not enough managers and supervisor to go around to help with the things such as overrides and unlocks.
good,"Great interaction with customers, management could be feeble at times but overall a good experience though the pay could have been better.  Coworkers were nice and enjoyed interacting with them."
good,"Maybe call centers shouldn't be in small towns.  The prejudices, and the high school immaturity shouldn't be in a workplace, but in Wilkesboro all the way to the sight director, prejudice and favoritism  play a major role especially in the management.  "
good,When I first started I really like my job but once management change   His expectations were too high for the amount to pay that we received. Lowe's use to be a very good place to work.The new restructure of loads has turned out to be quite a mess the service managers do not work. As coverage they were just watch dogs over the employees to actually do the physical labor..  management does not seem to care about families .  The company is not very consistent with  policy and procedures . The company used to give out really decent bonuses but that has stopped .
good,During my tenure with Lowe's I have learned a variety of things concerning customer service along with the building of houses.  However I will never work there again!  The scheduling for work hours is a nightmare where you may have to work until 10:00 one night and then open at 6:30 the next morning.  Not only that but pay rate for Lowe's employee's is the lowest that I have ever experienced considering the amount of work that is expected of you.  Not only that but the HR department is completely biased to certain groups of people leaving others out to dry.
good,This company has been around for over 85 years but has recently been purchased by Lowe's and has a experienced an influx of capital to help revive the brand and take it national.
good,"The company was ok to work for. I had to become an independent leader to my  team because the tools they were providing for them were being used to reach for unattainable goals. The corporate office didn't report good enough numbers to the stock holders so they  decided to cut 1800 Assistant manager jobs this year. Additionally they cut 13 department manager titles out of the stores. After 1 year they will be terminated if they don't find another position. They made it seem like a family atmosphere, but reporting 3 billion in overall profits for the year wasn't good enough to keep thousands of people employed. At the end of it they don't really care about their employees or anyone that works for them. It is the big wigs getting their 30-50 million a year jobs. Don't see them taking a pay cut, in fact they gave their selves raises last year...corrupt a little you think?"
good,Have applied for several postions with Lowe's and tried to get promoted within my department.  Promotions are hard to come by.  I work hard in my postion and do what is needed to advance.  Management does not give adaquate training on new positions.
good,I loved working for Lowe's.  Best place I've ever been employed.  My group of peers were absolutely phenomenal.  I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to come up through the company with.
good,"The job culture was nice, everyone was like a family to eachother and always willing to teach you something new. Typical day is running back and forth helping people, you are always moving. management was not good at the time but has since changed."
good,assembled products all day halped customers find the right products they are looking for. explain the product they want to buy and make sure the product they want to buy is right product for ths job
good,"Everyone's experience on a job is different, I always let others form their on opinion. I have received alot of knowledge and experience working there."
good,"Cant speak on all Lowe's locations but my particular store is a mess. The management isn't fully trained and prepared for their position, which in turn trickle down to the employees not trusting them."
good,"Fun and exciting place to work, but you have constant worry it is your last day because of frequent layoffs. You answer phone lines from customers that have many different needs, and address and resolve any problems."
good,"Lowes focuses primarily on customer service. Customers can expect the employees at Lowes to attempt to teach them how to build their houses, clean their houses, and maintain their homes."
good,"Fellow employees made the work more tolerable.  It was fun to help customers love where they live. It was often difficult to get the needed help from management, especially, if you were a part-time employee."
good,Lowes is a fun place to work with hours typical of retail. There have been too many changes over the past year; which have resulted in many workers leaving and uncertainty. Management does not always follow through with issues or concerns. The hardest part of the job is having to do work of other employees who continually do not complete their own tasks and management does not hold these employees accountable.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers to find the right product to fit their needs.
good,"When at lowes i really like it working with a small crew away from everybody cant complain, only thing i didnt like that we was time to clear out the truck and sometimes there might be two chrucks on the same time"
good,"restructure of lowes company, fewer ppl on the sales floor, employees covering many departments, fewer knowledgeable ppl, seems most of the seasoned ppl or ppl with a knowledge base are fired and replaced with part time children with no work ethic.  "
good,"Working at Lowe's was fun in the beginning, but eventually with the restructuring it took away the security and necessary jobs needed to help the customers properly."
good,company completely changed directions and got rid of positions. this downsizing cost many their jobs. Overall it is a decent place to work but the corporate office is always changing things.
good,"Easy job"
good,"Overall, I like Lowe's. They are a decent company overall. They pay a little bit more than most big box retail stores, and their benefits are decent. If you get good managers, then you'll enjoy it. If your management team isn't any good, then you'll probably hate it."
good,"I was responsible for everything in my department, but was paid the least. Hard work is not noticed, but mistakes are noticed tenfold. I enjoy the people i work with"
good,"Lowes has been restructuring for the better part of 2 years. This restructuring has targeted mostly full time/long term employees who are earning above the 15.00-20.00 hr mark. Intending to replace them with partime employees in order to save money. This has left an void in experienced management and taken knowledgeable employees out of their areas of expertise creating  huge gaps in coverage and more technical work... placed on inexperienced employees. The result has been an absolute disaster. My advice would be to stop trying to compete with Amazon and just be Lowes...provide answers and how to advice to consumers who could easily shop online but are in the store for hands on shopping. Lowes has spent countless millions on their website, which does not function, they centrally located their installs... out of the store which has also created delays, confusion and mistakes, continue to spend millions on their managers conventions with car and vacation give a ways while laying off employees who have long been the backbone of their business."
good,"Busy from the time you begin work, must have good customer service skills, able to interact with people, knowledge of product that is avaible throughout the store."
good,"Work hard , no slacking, come to work and don't let people hold you back. Always try to move up by learning everything you can. Always be a leader, not a follower."
good,"good place to work and learn all aspects of home improvement, you will work hard and the hours are long but you do get the enjoyment of helping people."
good,"It was a pretty fun workplace until they did a management overhaul. Now it's stressful and tiring."
good,I loved my tenor at Lowe's.  If you worked hard you were rewarded for your effort.  I've worked for management that I absolutely loved and fostered my growth for most of my employment. I was moved to a new group that didn't see my value and it tested my love of the organization.  I was the bottom rung on a ladder and took the fall for those who I reported to.
good,"Unpredictable hours, Delivery Drivers work until all deliveries for the day are completed. Whether thats 10am or 10pm. Heavy lifting all day, out of the store most of the time. Work in weather."
good,"The culture at the Lowe's corporate office is ever changing and evolving to fit the current customer. It seems as if the chase for sales to beat THD quarterly numbers is the major  focus. Work performance  is less important than how well one plays ""the corporate game"" of office politicking.  Employees are constantly asked to do more with less and working 50 to 60 hours a week is normal and expected to succeed.  The good old boy network is alive and well in the halls of Lowe's."
good,"Typically a day at work consisted of being very productive with a large amount of clients entering the store consistently. While working at Lowes I learned that it is important to be cautious and alert when dealing with customers as safety policies are strongly enforced. Management does an okay job at communicating, most managers are open to assisting with any questions one may have. The workplace is sometimes difficult but that is mostly due to not having enough staff available to help. The most enjoyable part was my fellow co workers, they made it a fun environment."
good,"hardest part of the job so many things are out of you're control"
good,"The company used to be about fluid communication, store success, employee morale and advancement opportunities."
good,"decent job good steady hours. good part time job if you go to school or have another job. work environment Is fun and easy, once you get familiar with you job time will go by fast"
good,"I worked at Lowes for about 2 1/2 years in the delivery department and I didn't hate the job but like most jobs in can be frustrating when others don't do their job right and you're the one left cleaning it up, especially in retail. The product was sometimes pulled for us but when it wasn't it meant you had to find it, unwrap it or wrap it, load it on the truck, blanket it, and then strap it in. The trucks are supposed to be loaded and ready to go when you get in ( almost never were ) and that takes a lot of time out of your day. The new delivery system was god awful and employees and customers were complaining about it not working. There was plenty of OT if you wanted it but if you have a family its definitely not the best job with a changing schedule every day/ week. I would either start at 7, 9, or 11 am and you're done when the work is done which sucks because you're day revolves around the customer and how easy or hard they can be to work with determines when you can go home. Sometimes you wouldn't get done until 8 or 9 or later then have to be right back in at 7 am the next day. Not to mention you get one weekend off a month. Days off during the week were nice to have but you end up missing out on a lot of events on weekends. The people I worked with for the most part were great to work with and the employees and most management were helpful, if you could get a minute of their time that is. The pay was decent but the hours were not and the job itself was a good workout and you get to drive all over and see different things and different house's which sometimes were really"
good,"Lowes needs some help on making it a good place to work, they do such a good job on customer service for the customer, but they really need to try and do the same for the employees, ""if they flourish on the inside, they will shine on the outside"" They need a lot of work on that."
good,"As far as taking care of the employees it was not a bad job.  You had good managers, and terrible ones.  The customer base was always tough a lot of times people could not find help when they came in the store, or an expert so they would get angry and take it out on the employees."
good,A lot of jobs have recently been taken away from the company. In return this has created a very negative work environment
good,"Lots of changes in a very short time with the company.  The company slashed payroll in all stores during Q3 and Q4, resulting in customer complaints and overall drop of associate engagement.  Store Manager was great.  Very experienced and a joy to work for.  Unfortunately, company laid off 1/3 to 1/2 of all Assistant Managers in each store across the company."
good,"Lowe's corporate is a great place to start a corporate career, but you'll earn far more in another industry.  And there's still a degree of old-boyism left over from years past."
good,im always busy don't mind working in other departments once my work is completed train other employees on power equipment ran cash register ill will do whatever it takes to give good customer services
good,"I have learned much from working at Lowe's much of which I will be able to use with future careers.  I can also say that there is no one within Lowe's you can trust, managers will act as if they care and will terminate you the following week. The people who work at Lowe's give their hearts and soles for the company each and everyday however the company does not give anything in return.  At one point Lowe's was a great company to work for because they cared about the people, now it is all about Wall Street.  When will companies learn if you take care of your people, your people will take care of the business."
good,If you're lucky they might work with you and your goals but odds are when you're there you're there. For a retail place however it is one of the best
good,"In general work is fine, can be very stressful at times because of understaffing, rude customers, and unhelpful coworkers. Also the amount of shoplifting is ridiculous, we hand out hundreds of dollars a day to obvious criminals."
good,"I worked there for two years, I enjoyed the job but didn't get treated like a human being by some of the management. I have permanent damage to my spine because I had to lift very heavy products by myself due to management not hiring capable people. "
good,"Good pay, great benefits.  Restructuring has become an annual event at the end of every fiscal year so job security is nil. Safety is always top of mind, but it's more about how much money can be saved on the bottom line than actual employee safety.  As a manager you will have no work life balance, as your shifts will be rotating between open (530 am) , mid (9am-8pm) and closing (12pm-11pm).  Sometimes you will work an close, then a mid, then open, with only 6-7 hour off in between.  If you try to negotiate a better schedule you will be told ""it works in 1700 stores, it will work here"" and senior managers are not interested in hearing any options."
good,"they start you off over minimum wage which is great, but the lack of hours kills. they can go from 10 hours to almost 30 from week to week, they will even cut our hours after a schedule is posted is corporate decided they should. management can be great when they want to be. you have to be someones buddy to move up in the company though."
good,Lowe's provided me with employment for 10 years so far.  In the ed the store were understaffed ad they are now i process of downsizing ASM's and eliminating DM's.
good,"The customer interation was great. Helping people find the things they needed, and making suggestions to help them complete there projects.I also didn't ming the teaching of new associates on how to stock shelves and maintain stores ceanliness and how to help customers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able help customers. When customers have a bad experience with another employee. I do everything I can to help them, and make sure they are satisfied before they leave the store. When the customers are happy it makes my day."
good,"Need more career opportunities, can't advance in life with pay. Small raises. Can improve in a lot of areas, but good for young people that are in college."
good,"its all about the dollar not about the people,make the sale make the sale make the sale is all they care about they hire people who really dont have a clue about what theyre selling so they bs the costomer into the sale"
good,"Was a good company to work for with plenty of room for advancement for those who were motivated. The particular store I worked for was badly mismanaged and constantly understaffed, and pressure to make up for the lack of staffing was put on the shoulders of the department managers, I frequently worked 50-60 hours a week during our busy spring/summer season while being kept 50% understaffed in my three departments to save payroll."
good,its a great COMPANY TO WORK FOR IF THE PROPER MANAGER IS PALCE. this company has it sup and downs  but the employees is what make the job fun they treat eachother like family
good,"Most days were slow, management always tries to have you cover multiple departments for the same low pay and no benefits."
good,I think its a nice place to work. Best in retail business as far as career wise.Your success depends on you and how far you want to go in the company.
good,"Great team, but as with all big box stores some slack others put out. no commission, conflict of interest with scheduling, weak management, very understaffed"
good,The job itself was not a bad job. Unloading a truck and getting the stuff out to the stores. The management was terrible though. We were short handed in the back and were promised that new people would be hired soon. Never saw any new people to come help unload the trucks and would then get complained at for not getting things done on time.
good,"Job can be great or unbearable depending on management.  There are many types of jobs available within any local store.  Many positions are professional level but compensation is typical retail.  A wonderful place for a part time position, but a difficult place for the career oriented."
good,"Worst job ever! Management is very clicky, which means you'll only have an opportunity to advance if they ""approve"" of you. You are not judged on workethic."
good,Lowes is a great place to work at. You meet so many interesting people and the idea of helping someone solve a problem is great. It is a great way for young people to start their careers.
good,"Management seem to think they are better than their team, not supportive and disrespectful at times.  They were flexible with hours, but required you to be there during high demand times."
good,Typically a day working at Lowes was pretty repetitive. More times than not managers were too busy to help when they were needed. But overall good environment to work in with good people.
good,"Do nothing to rock the boat, not interested in suggestions on improvement despite what the corporate culture says. Hires incompetent individuals and only removes them when they cost the company serious loss. Thopughly enjoyed helping customers realize their dreams of home improvement."
good,Little to no advancement available at this store. Store morale is very low. Not a very happy atmosphere at all. Would not recommend to anyone.
good,"Good benefits, although if you are a student going to classes, they really do not like to schedule around you. The management was very good to work with. Co workers were always there to help new employees. "
good,"‚Ä¢	Responsible for overall Company Sales of Exterior Building Products.  ( Windows, Fencing, Gutters, HVAC, Roofing, Vinyl Siding, Generators, Decking. )"
good,"I worked there for quit a few years and because I am a very happy go lucky person who is definitely out going person, management thought that it would be hard for fellow working to take me as a manager type of role. I will say that all in all the company is a great company. Now management has changed and I left on good terms and can still work for the company."
good,"If you are a free spirit with your own thought process, don't even waste your time. Your spirit will be crushed and you will be asked to change who you are as a person to conform to their standards"
good,"The overall job of delivery and working with customers was good.  With working in delivery, you never know what time you were going to get off which makes job/life balance be a negative."
good,"As far as co workers of my position they are the only ones that keep this business a float. Everyone in higher positions don't communicate, its always cofusion, nor are they open for suggestions to improve the business. As far as the job itsself its a definite means of making ends meet but there is no room for growth with this company."
good,"Managers, don't seem to know how to schedule an effective workforce.  Employee retention is really bad.  People often just quit on the spot with no notice.  During the warmer months they aften leave workers out in garden for hours without changing the workforce with fresh workers. Most of he employees are polit and caring."
good,"The job isn't to bad, but the system of management isn't very good. There are about 3 more tiers of management than there should be and nobody really communicates with each other."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities to advance at Lowe's if you apply yourself and work hard.  Work/life balance is advertised as important but the workload doesn't match that commitment.  You will have to work outside of office hours to accomplish your work.  A typical work week is 60-70 hours.  The corporate office continues to reinvent itself as its tries to adjust to the current competitive environment.  Unfortunately there are two main divisions between the COO and CCO and both divisions have their own agendas which causes a lot of confusion and disjointed execution.  Honest feedback and transparency isn't welcomed.  In order to have a long prosperous career at Lowe's you must adapt to the changes and not say anything.  Holding employees accountable is pushed in order to help people love where they live but is rarely executed because the HR department is risk adverse.  If you are willing to accept your current teams performance, adapt to a politically charged work environment,  and work long hours Lowe's Corporate is a exceptional employer."
good,Run of the mill corporate store. Micromanagement and someone looking over your sholder. Staff worked well and always tried there best.
good,Didn't work for the best location so I don't really have much to say about this company. I've worked there twice and both times have not been a true reflection of the company considering the location I worked for closed so I cannot comment on my experience.
good,I was able to learn a new skill and be able to work at a fast pace while doing so. I was able to meet many new people from around the would and service them.
good,"A lot of cleaning, organizing, restocking, sales. Employees may be helpful or don't approach, many customers and made to wait around. Personally feel that the role that was assigned was well done."
good,"busy everyday"
good,"I love working here. My coworkers are like family. I have learned many new things about the public and how big of a deal good customer service skills are. They play a key role maintaining a productive work environment. The most enjoyable part was being able to have fun and smile, but still get things done."
good,I really enjoyed the environment and the coworkers.  Only downside was the inability to move up into management and learn areas within the store.  So many management members no one seemed to be on the same page of what regulations and changes in regulations are.
good,I learned how to be a good customers service rep and a cashier. I got to know my coworkers very well and the management team was fair.
good,"work independent of upper management. extremely fast paced that requires quick decision making, multi tasking is an absolute necessity. heavy call volume and foot traffic."
good,"The only thing that was holding me at Lowes was pay during college, and people I enjoyed working with there. Most enjoyable part of my job was exploring the area in which I was living, and the people I had been working with. My co-workers within the delivery team was the only reason why I had chosen to stay becasue they made me feel like family."
good,"It is hard to be objective about working at Lowe's right now. I'm exhausted from working 7 and 8 day stretches. As a company overall, they try to squeeze every ounce of productivity from their employees by strategically making the schedule up so that they end up working 7,8 and 9 day stretches without anyone going into overtime. Overtime is forbidden and you will get written up if you go one minute into overtime. And when they are way over comp no one gets extra hours, but when they don't make comp they cut hours drastically to their part-timers and ask they full timers to donate hours. It  is hard for employees who are treated this way to have the desire to put up with all the rude and demanding customers and be loyal and dedicated to a company that clearly has no concern for them. The pay is so-so...at least more than minimum wage. The people I work with are for the most part great people."
good,Long hours but work 3 to 4 days during peak season if you're fresh out of high school go for it but it's only time before your body can't take it anymore. Normal day consist of getting any where from 6 up to 15 doors a piece lifting items that weigh from 5 up to 70+lbs. if you're into back breaking labor this job is for you.
good,Its and ok place to work. I didn't like the schedual situation and that they never have enough employees to work on a busy day.
good,I started working at Lowes Foods with experience in tow. I was able to go from restaurant manager to meat clerk effortlessly. I learned how to manage my tasks with a strict time limit for everything to be completed. The hardest part of the job was to make sure to complete tasks in a set amount of time. I enjoyed working with customers the most. I also was able to make friends with most of my coworkers.
good,Most weekly schedules have at least one occurrence where an employee closes at night and opens the next morning. There are ample opportunities for advancement for anyone willing to work this type of scheduling and work hard.
good,"El area administrativa (gtes) hacen el ambiente muy pesado, no respetan horas de salida ni descansos, no pagan horas extras pero si exigen que se queden a trabajar mas horas"
good,"If you are an external hire the possibilities to move upward are very slim. Manager entrenchment is very apparent, especially at the Store Manager position and above.  If you are hired as an ASM be prepared to be treated poorly by your Store Manager and don't expect the Market Director to even acknowledge your existence. Other than that I really love working in this environment, managing merchandise, dealing with customers and the fellow associates.  I learn every day about the things I really enjoy doing in my off time.  "
good,Unfortunately the Lowes location I worked at suffered from poor leadership as a result low morale and dysfunction trickles down into every aspect of work-life. Avoid this place if you can
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's. I interact with all my Customers and provided them with excellent customer service with locating, loading, ringing up product and unloading. I also had to process refunds, returns, and exchanges. My co-workers were very friendly and was always willingly to work hard together to finish all the daily task for department."
good,"Nice benefits package.  Work environment is very top notch...excellent food and coffee services.  Easy access from interstate, no issues with parking and beautiful surroundings."
good,Generally speaking Lowes is a good place to work. The work environment is loud and busy at times. The health benefits are decent and they have a program called life track that employees can utilize for all aspects of health. The retirement package offers a match  depending on how much you put into it. They also offer employee stock at a discounted price. There's a 10% discount off most purchases. In my area they seem to do a good job in hiring the right people.
good,"poor organization and management from store level all the way to district level. Typical retail job. high turnover, poor work ethic, poor training programs, and inconsistency"
good,I love my job at Lowe's because I enjoy working with the public and it's fast paced. I learn something new all the time. My co-workers are the best.
good,"It use to be that as long as you followed corporate policies, you would not have to worry about your job. That is no longer the case. They now have so many policies, some of them contradict each other, you can loose your job for actually helping a customer. Management at the store level has their hands tied and are unable to make a lot of decisions that would be beneficial for their store."
good,Lowes has a policy of scheduling different shift times on different days. Rarely did I work the same shift two consecutive days. Also the pay was not adequate when only recieving 25-30 hours a week
good,Lowe's had some issues keeping good managers .. But all of the floor employees were very good at their jobs and it was very easy to get information and help from most floor employees .. Overall great people to work with but no hours and a lot of slow times I prefer a more fast paced job ..
good,If You are not part of the click you get overlooked a lot of back stabbing for no apparent gain.If you like being treated like a grade school kid this is the place for you.
good,"ÔÅÆ	Interview and recruit new phone agents, complete employee evaluations, and deliver disciplinary actions up to and including termination"
good,The front end is run by a bunch of immature young women. There is a lot of high school drama not a positive place to work if you are a senior employee.
good,"My department was always very busy and the job could be physically demanding.   Also very irregular schedule, seemed frequently understaffed but friendly coworkers."
good,"Lowe's was a company i always wanted to work for. I work hard in selling and making a relationship to and for customers and the company. However i have had no stability and moving up is very hard as to where when the company is comfortable with you where you are they wont want to give you a full time position or promote you. A lot of favoritism unfortunately and a lot of employees get away with a lot of things. It is a good place to learn when you partner with the right people however. But other then that, yes the job may be fun and enjoyable. But i am looking to grow within a company and be appreciated for my hard work."
good,"Very stressful work environment, customers are very rude and disrespectful. Management do not back you up. Store manager dont speak  nor know his associates."
good,Rotating schedule and hard to manage home life. I learned that customer service is a number one priority over any job you are trying to complete.
good,I liked it.  I liked the people i worked with but the management was not seasoned in customer service.  A 4 year degree does not qualify you to work with the public but at Lowe's it apparently does.  I left there due to a lack of management structure and advancement.  I see now that Lowes is trying to struggle and keeps down sizing their corporate offices.  Home Depot has always gave them a run for their money and always will.
good,"Lowe's is not a bad place to work, however it is a very unorganized company. Advancement is not made easy and they very rarely will promote people that already work for the company. I love my co-workers but upper management could be better aside from a few."
good,"Working at Lowes has it's pros and cons like any job, but the company's  work benefits and overall environment is full of positive energy."
good,"your whole life will be work. no weekends off , no holidays off, you work your life away. you work a corporate schedule which doesnt give you weekends off.  If you choose to work part time, you can get hours as low as 10 hrs a week. not enough to live on.  if your fulltime expect to work mornings, evenings, and as mention before all holidays and weekends."
good,Department manager position not too difficult.  You have about 3 reports to work a week and a meeting on Tuesday at 2.  Most of the time is spent as floor coverage and not managing.  Department manager is not really an accurate description of position as you are expected to do many supervisory functions.  Better title would be assistant assistant manager as you are pretty much just the manager on duty's helper.
good,"okay job, but could have been better if management would have care about the employee.. overall a good company but bad management is run that store.."
good,"A few years ago Lowe's was a good employer. Lowe's had a growth mentality, and the stock responded accordingly. Lowe's shareholders would benefit greatly with several changes in leadership."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Constant flow of customers."
good,"Be prepared for the weather if its hot outside its hot inside. The pays ok. I never had any problems with management, but if you just do your job you'll be ok"
good,"Loved my job up to a year ago.  Lowes does not support the employee expectations of advancement.  They also do not supply the means to be successful with the public as far as the employee is concerned.  Can you imagine being an Appliance Specialist and handling not only the Appliance Department but Plumbing and Kitchen Cabinets at the same time by yourself and keeping everyone happy.  I tried, I don't want to do it anymore."
good,"OK place to work to earn a few paychecks but defiantly not a career , Unorganized , horrible hours . Management needs improving"
good,"A typical day includes being understaffed with too many tasks to complete in a given workday.  Lowe's has provided me the opportunity to learn Kitchen Design effectively as well as take part in several leadership training courses that I otherwise would not have been able to attend.  The training is fair, but can be extremely good with a motivated and intelligent individual who is willing to learn.  The co-workers can vary, but that is with any workplace.  The hardest part of the job is being expected to constantly complete an almost insurmountable number of tasks with little to no staff to support you.  The most enjoyable part is being in an environment that provides a great deal of latitude with merchandising, giving each person the opportunity to become an entrepreneur."
good,"Work environment tended to be fairly stressful; especially when there were associates in the same area that were not fulfilling their job requirements. Management was not supportive and also had their ""favorites"". There was no room for advancement within the store, especially if a department manager didn't want you to leave that area. Pay rate/scale was not fair not only with gender but also with position. In the almost 9 1/2 years I was with the company, I only received a $3.44 total pay increase from the time I started to the time I left."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to for, problem with working for them is that if your management team likes you, you can do whatever you like. If your manager doesn't like you be prepared to be shuffled out the loop and put in the worst spots. you can fight to move up and transfer to different lowes but its a lonely road."
good,fun job with awesome people but the management is ridiculous. atleast it was when I was there. very little training. people are clueless.. yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
good,learned to interact with a lot of different people made sure was a clean place to work and for the customers. The people you work with are really great but then you have the ones that aren't where they should be and could make it hard on you.
good,"Working in a call center was challenging, but educational. I definitely learned the finer points of customer service, especially in regards to choosing just the right words to calm an upset customer."
good,"It was a good place to work, but they didn't provide me with enough hours. They also only offered seasonal employment which means I only work during the summer."
good,"This is a fun job to start off with, but there is not much room to excel or move up. Management at some stores could use some improvement. Scheduling is a big issue most of the time."
good,Solid established company with good benefits. Great assortment and emphasis on customer service. Brand recognition hinders the potential to cater to certain demographics based on areas stores are in.
good,"Too many directives given in a single day to feel a sense of accomplishment. I gained interior design and lighting knowledge while there."
good,"My typical day at work would be to gather my team together and issuing them there work load for the day, asking them to work safe and acknowledge the customers at all times. Verify EMS work tasks completed by my employees,ordering material and supplies for the company, calling in work orders for our computers to be repaired, walking the blue print of the store to verify that set are being placed in the correct area, building and re-setting props."
good,"I have about 19 years of forklift experience as well as order picking, shipping and receiving and palletizing. None of which were hardly utilized at Lowes. I am also a skilled laborer in the construction arena and half owner of my own contracting company, (Jones & Jones Home Solutions). Specializing in kitchen and bathroom remodeling, also ceramic, porcelain, natural stone tile and wood & laminate flooring, but yet, I continued to get looked over."
good,"If we should go on, then delivery could use a touch up. Lowes, where I worked had one of the highest delivery records in the area, but was in an old store with hardly any touch ups or upgrades. I guess to save money or something. It was taxing working with old stuff as we were always busy."
good,"working with customers all day "
good,"I began my career when I helped open a store in Maryland. Since then I was able to go to various stores and noticed that while the company overall was terrific, it really depended on what store you were at.  Even stores within the same district were completely different.  I did enjoy my time there and what I learned."
good,"Can be a fun place to work and you can learn to do almost anything you need to know about home improvement.  The hardest thing about the job is long hours on your feet on concrete floors, various hours you are scheduled to work, working weekends and holidays and late nights followed by early mornings. The most enjoyable part is the relationships you form with your customers and coworkers."
good,Working at Lowe's started off being fun and enjoyable. As time went on we got new management and things got more stressful. Not enough workers and no one communicated with each other.
good,"Lowe's was a great part time job but not a career. I loved working at Lowe's and co-workers was great. The only problem was lack of hours and benefits for part time workers was great. It's perfect for students in school and looking for extra income, they will work around your schedule."
good,Normally I would show up for work and sign into an automated system. Assuming i signed in during the afternoon i would consult with other garden center associates about what was done in the morning and then proceed to water anything that was dry. Apart from that i would have to deal with many customers asking me prices for products that were only labeled with bar codes and no price tags. about 70% of products in the garden center had no prices or the price tags in-front of items did not match the item behind it. I found this to be one of the hardest parts of the job because i did not like telling customers sorry we have a major problem with our pricing in the store and our manager refused to let any employees spend the time needed to actually price the products. That being said I very much enjoyed my experience with getting to know other employees as well as whenever had the opportunity to actually help or assist any of the customers with problems that I could solve.
good,Interesting experience - enjoyed customer interaction. OSLG requires highly physical individual who is organized and can relate well with customers.
good,"Hitting the floor running, getting everything together to deliver, making sure everything is correct, Inspecting items to be delivered, printing load tickets, having supervisor check off all items to delivery sheets, load all items accordingly with the route of deliveries, secure and strap down load, call customers, give them a 2 hour window for delivery, Inspecting truck for pre-trip, fuel truck, meet delivery schedule time for customer, making sure all paperwork is sign by customer and making sure it is installed correctly. If there is any problems solving the problems and move on to the next customer. a usual day we have any where from 8-15 deliveries. After every customer has been taken care of, removing all used appliances from truck and put the appliances in a  appliance trailer, clean out the truck and get the truck ready for the next day. The hardest part of the job was scheduling deliveries, timing was everything. If the delivery was not timed right it could put the next delivery behind and it only made every delivery get behind. Turn in all paperwork to manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the customer smile and happy."
good,"My fellow floor associates were amazing. Upper management leaved some to be desired. Company used to be a fantastic place to work for and give its employees an amazing experience. Has been going downhill to meet sales goals for stock holders the past few years."
good,"Looking out for it self , was a great company before all the budgets cuts .Fast pace , long hours. fun and everyday was a new challenge."
good,We have alot of associates that work at our store but on alot of days we do not have enough people scheduled throughout the store to help with the customers like needed. This affects the store tremendously and it needs to be fixed.
good,Job environment was not one in which a person would want make this a place for a career. Moral here was not good because certain managers had employees who were their favorite. These people tended to get away with being late for work or from a break and lunch and nothing was done to stop this behavior.
good,I was the manager of the front end.  I did the scheduling and the training.  I really enjoyed the management the first time I worked there 8 years ago the place has changed now.
good,"My first time in retail and found it interesting. Never working in this type of job I found it interesting how people are treated when it came to working unplanned hours, how schedules were changed so quickly. The pay was also low for the amount of work expected I felt. Being in warehousing and MFG for so many I was surprised how people could make it on the salaries they were getting."
good,It is not a bad job and it pays decent. The supervisors are nice and fairly understanding. The management of the store is a little more standoffish.
good,"Drama was crazed. Management would favor employees over others. When one would be at the lowest position and were promoted to a higher position, they would go on a power trip. Unfair write ups such as a favored employee could get away with something but if another employee did it, they get written up. Too many assumptions. Part time benefits are more expensive than full time benefits. Unfair raises; management doesn't really make an effort on reviews of performance. Conflicts are not really confidential as promised by HR. Employes aren't given actual chances of moving up. Normally they are passed over."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work if you are in college and are looking for some extra cash. The management is very sketchy, especially human resources and the store manager. They seem to not have any time for an employee or a former employee. When you have a problem they tend to push it to the side and the store manager at times does not know you exist in the store."
good,"A very fast pace work area, with a High Turnover of Employees. Over all it was a Job and I looked for the best opportunity from it and will be forever grateful for the chance to work there."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's."
good,In the store im in its too many favorites. I come to find out that no matter how good you work there are some people who dont appreciate quality work. managment has favorites and more. Great work place if ran properly. co workers come in go but when here then do just enough to look ok. I enjoy working at my job. Getting the work done so we can get off and relax.
good,It is just a place to work and they put the people they want into positions they that come open with out interviewing for the open positions and even if they do interview the person they already know who they want and they get the positions
good,the pay is not good 21cent in one year is not a good raise if you are a hard worker and expect others to work hard you will be sadly disappointed the management is nice but will not do anything to fix the lazy ens that is raiment at that store. good luck if your go to work for the republic store.
good,Opening and closing.... really weird schedule and hours. Well if you were stuck as a part timer being promised a full time gig which was the case for me anyway. Trying to keep the busiest department of the store stocked at all times was a challenge specially with constant customer questions an service depending on who was working an for how long. Opening shifts were nice but working the weekends and holidays were never something I enjoyed. Management was okay... I just didn't like the way they treated the part timers wanting an needing more hours. Considered finding a second job wile working here but could never get a set schedule or enough money to support myself forcing me to find work else where.
good,it was ok not always what i was told it would be.I would recommrend in a metro market. The plans dont always match the resiourcves
good,"Too many bosses, each with their own agenda, often in conflict, makes it impossible to succeed in my position.  Coworkers all agree with their misery but are helpless to do anything about it."
good,typical day is 6 to 3pm waiting on customers and taking orders and answering questions in person or on the phone.  Job consisted of Customer Service and Point of Sale
good,"Typical day at work involved working outside of my department constantly due to shortages in other areas, areas that you were not trained in nor had the knowledge of the products."
good,"My day would be a nice relaxing day where I would usually assist customers as much as possible then do side work such as stocking, cleaning, etc. However: The managers were lazy and rather isolated from their associates. Not very supportive managers minus a few selected, and lots of drama between them."
good,"performed daily receiving of freight with no supervision but great co-workers. very cold during the winter. hard to work for as they always seem to be heading in a new direction, often seems lost as a company."
good,"Nothing to inform at this time."
good,"One store had hardworking coworkers, and great management. The other did not. The difference was like night and day. Just depends on the people."
good,"An average day well start out depending what time I come in to work. I make sure I read all my e-mails. Make sure all my cashiers are in, give breaks, lunches etc... what I learn at work is always have customer service ready. Management is a little tough on me sometimes but I always get the job done. Co-workers are great to work with. Don't know what I would do with out them. hardest part of the job is dealing with people sometimes customers/management. I wake up everyday thankful i have a job, plus my co-workers are the best. They make me fill good when I am around (good vibes) they say. That I would not change for nothing. Love my co-workers!"
good,"No Comment. Tough environment, understaffed based upon busy store and customer service standards"
good,"I worked for Lowes for almost 2 years as a lumber cashier. I got to build relationships with local contractors. I liked the hands on work; there is some really heavy lifting, but people with help you of course. The only problem I can say, and the reason I left, was the  harassment you get from customers. I would wear a t shirt and jeans to work, nothing special at all, and get crude comments, and even had customers grab me."
good,"A typical place to work not too friendly but not too off putting just enough to make you realize there are worst places to work,"
good,"50 - 60 hour work week in an ever changing fast paced environment where sales is a priority and customer service is secondary.  This company has little or no regard for the employee, only to make sales."
good,"workingl with customers, I learned how to work with the public. I learned how to run different departments by myself and be helpful to my co-workers whn they need it. the worst part of the job was working different shifts every week. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular customers that come to get help from me. The management was half good. no communication with associates."
good,looking to leave because as a disabled Veteran I accepted a position there and they never provided the accommodations agreed upon. Now I am currently off of work because of worsening of symptoms and they are unable to accommodate the mandated  doctor restrictions.
good,"worked there for over 5 years and was a model employee, even went through management training programs through the company...however, I was never considered for advancement. this was ultimately my reason for departure"
good,"Goals and objectives were constantly changing throughout the day."
good,It is an okay place to work but I was promised I could move up. I was there for almost a year and I am stuck in the same position.
good,"I would call customers that I had talked about new flooring in their home from the previous week to see if they want to go ahead with a project. then I would stock isles with new product. The rest of the day spent cleaning isles, straightening shelves,talking customers into projects."
good,"great company but very low pay, not very good management, co workers all have low morale, little to no training,"
good,Never expected to learn a lot about tools and hardware equipment. It was good experience in a good environment to work in.
good,Good place to work as long as your not going to school. I learned to have patience when handling customers.
good,Great place to work but really no advancement opportunities
good,"Day starts at 7am. You are scheduled off 4pm but you never get off when scheduled. I come into work where my mangers job is to have the truck loaded and ready to pull off, but that is never the case. Usually no items are pulled so i have to pull, unbox, and load all appliances that are to be delivered today. After i print off a invoice for all items on the truck i have to wait on a manger to check the truck off. Once me and the driver are checked off by a manger we deliver every appliance until the truck is empty no matter of time, unless you run into DOT 14 hours ohio laws! Even then they sometimes accept  the fines and make you finish the deliveries."
good,There is very rarely a pattern to a work day always something different to do. My coworkers for the most part are like a small family. The hardest part of my job is trying to get to-do lists done for managers and still give outstanding customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting customers with their needs and seeing them leave happy.
good,"not much to say. It was a seasonal job"
good,"Working at Lowes was great during the early summer months because it stayed busy and the hours were plentiful. Once the rush of summer was over, however, it was a rapid decline in hours and work to be done."
good,"Work day/week..."
good,"-Usually a fast pace work environment on a daily basis."
good,At the end of my time at Lowes the store manager was transferred and the work environment improved greatly.
good,Responsible for opening and closing procedures to protect assets including personnel and inventory. Provide superior customer service ensuring loyalty. The hardest part of the job was dealing with pressures caused by visiting corporate personnel. I most enjoyed taking care of the customer - helping them find what they need either in the store or on-line.
good,"I enjoyed the challenges of attempting to satisfy the many customers I interacted with. Quite a few would ask for me by name. At times I was given the opportunity to produce results that amazed the other managers. These situations required that I develop a partnership with a carrier or vendor. They respected me for my word and would accommodate my request. The store profited in several different ways from my ethics. In 1998 with a hurricane approaching I arranged to get the stores quota delivered in three hours. None of the other managers had ever seen that happen. I challenged myself to have a positive attitude and it manifested itself in my crew. No task was above or below their attempting it. One of the difficulties I faced was the absence of people steeped in corporate knowledge, It posed a problem when attempting to accomplish something out of the ordinary. However, as I was usually successful in my efforts this gave me a feeling of great satisfaction and pride. While some people were impressed by this some managers and co-workers just regarded it as a standard for me. The men and women I worked with were a great inspiration to me and I felt as if they could look to me for guidance."
good,"Working at Lowes was a very good job that I miss. I learned quite a bit from my experiences there and was constantly encouraged to learn more. As live nursery specialist my day started early with a  review of current plant inventory, what tables needed product consolidated, what tables/plants that were in need of watering, and placement for new product coming in. My fellow co-workers were all hard-working and proud of how well we kept our product well watered and our garden center always clean and well stocked."
good,"not a professional work environment. kind of seemed like management couldn't keep up with their employees, when they were suppose to be there or weren't. often had no employees in departments due to scheduling mess ups."
good,"A merchandiser is a great opportunity and gives you the ability to work with all parts of the organization.  It is an area where you have an idea, put together a plan to make this happen, and the greatest piece is seeing it become a reality in stores.  All of my co-workers are smart, fun, and creative individuals that make each day fun."
good,"Not a bad place to work, hours are cut often and short notice given when cutting hours."
good,"Nice co-workers and customers, busy sometimes when customers come, but most of the time it is so boring there because not many customers around to shop. but enjoyable with the technology system to help out the customers."
good,different day we were busy other times a little slow. restocking the floors allowed me to show customer what they needed to do different things also to cleanc my mind i worked alone. Nothing was hard about this job at all.
good,"I would open the store and distribute cash into registers"
good,"This is a very demanding job. a psi is basically a project manager, so it is very detailed oriented, and can be time consuming"
good,"Lowe's is a good company which compensates their worker's sufficiently, however advancement is slow. A typical day at work is punching in and doing assigned tasks, sometimes overly supervised and sometimes not so heavily supervised. Sufficient work hours are given. Lowe's as a primary job does not pay enough if it is your only job unless you are in a higher position. Most workers also have second jobs."
good,I would work anywhere from 3-9 hours a day. I loved being a lumber cashier.
good,Great job for a person who is just starting off and is learning skills of the work force. Flexible hours and good pay for seasonal work.
good,"Most employees are treated like a number, the turn over is out of control because most store managers are more concerned about the business and there annual bonus that teaching and growing people to succeed isn't important to them. The turn over is most stores is astronomical, if you last 5 years you're a veteran. You have to be willing to play the political game of kiss the managers butt if you have any chance of advancement. lastly the interview is structured, meaning all candidates get asked the same questions, but they score the candidate ""they like"" with the best score and don't always hire the most qualified or best fit.... good luck.."
good,"did not place customer service as a prioity even though they talked about constantly,worried about hours worked rather than service and giving the customer the right product for their needs  and expectation"
good,"day at work stressful"
good,"Horrible hours, can be from 4am start or closing near midnight. 7 days a week one weekend off a month, rotating schedule. Pay based on 40 hrs., but always scheduled 48. Pay is OK if your fine with the hrs. or if your spouse can handle it. If you are not a SM or Admin you will close 75% of your shifts, regardless of rotation. Have to jockey with other managers for vacation days. Again its Retail."
good,"They talked a better game than they played."
good,"Open/Close sales floor, maintain appearance, down stock as needed"
good,A typical day for me at Lowes was coming in for a shift. Clocking in and getting to work in the lumber department. Helping customers with loading and unloading of various materials in their cars. Teaming up with coworkers to take on different tasks assigned to us. Then clocking out at the end of my shift.
good,It prepared me for management rolls in future as a cashier manager I learned alo
good,i work very hard for this company i go above and beyond for my job and when i apply for a full time job i never get interviewed and yet they always tell me how much of a hard worker i am.
good,"come to work and begin on days work list while helping customers, answering customer phone calls, keeping department cleaned and stocked, cart retrieval, load online orders, keep inventory in order for easy access"
good,i was always afraid that i would loose my job. the management seemed to talk to us any way they wanted i was told the i would make a temporary move to the sales floor and was forced to on the sales floor with no raise and when i brought up the fact that i was only supposed to be temporary i was told take the job or we will  terminate you.
good,"This was not the best job I've ever had, nor was it the worst. Management did not care for the Delivery crew, and didn't support them. There was 20 hours of forced overtime a week because they didn't want to hire anybody. The Pay was pretty good for the job, and aside from the issues with management I loved it."
good,"Provide excellent customer service while maintaining  a large crew, cashiering, special orders"
good,"Worked at Lowes for about 4 years.  Most of staff are good people.  The only problem is that there is no job security as the managers change all the time.  In four years I had three store managers, the last being terrible.  The area managers changed so often it was tough to tell who my manager would be that month.  The worst thing that could happen to an employee at Lowes it seems is get promoted as you'd be fired within months after being promoted."
good,"12-15 hour days, 6 days a week. As a salaried manager this was not a sustainable schedule. Improperly trained HR."
good,Lots of interaction with the public. Have to be good with people
good,I clock in at work and most of the time we are dead so not much to do. People are rude to you especially co workers and head of management. Shifts change constantly and hours vary and management will change your schedule without telling you. Will cut hours like crazy and pay is horrible.
good,Typical day begins with with zoning and down stocking.  As the day goes on the store gets busier and you have to find balance of engaging customers and tasking. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers and trying to resolve conflict.
good,"taking care of plants. assisting customers with purchases, recommending plants that will do well in their gardens"
good,lowes will not promote you if you don't have at least 10 years exp.
good,"Not a team environment"
good,Associates were very helpful. Enjoyed the customers. Products were great. The management was very distant. The hardest part of the job was just being thrown into a position with no training.
good,"Its is a good place to work. Needs improvment in some areas. Need to rethink that people work to live not live to work. Would love to have a set down with them and  set up a new program of schedules. How to train people what their jobs are. Typical day is clock in run report on deliveries for the day pull orders to overhead door. Pull truck around to load, load deliveries for the day,if second truck is scheduled pull it around to load for pm deliveries. Clean trash up in in area. Load flatbed truck for deliveries. Print tickets for delivery for all trucks. have them checked off, fill out delivery log. then start on deliveries for next day run report on box and flatbed check to make sure specal orders are in, install are ready for delivery and then pull orders. when all orders are done call customers to comfirm deliveries and address are right and ready for customers."
good,A typical work day started with the loading of the delivery truck with the day's deliveries.  The rest of the day is spent delivering the items.  Normally we were sent out with one helper to help with the lifting and setup.  The hardest part of the job was being careful inside a customer's home.  The most enjoyable was meeting all kinds of people.
good,Will refrain from my opinion...  ...but had the best associates in the market.
good,"Lowes does not hold up to there words at all. They have a very poor training program, no manuals for the employ to have for reverences to go by. The management only tells you what they want to tell you, because they do not want you to have a chance to advance in the Lowes program."
good,"This company is different from any company I was use to. When they tell you something, don't believe it. They did nothing but lie to me from the time I was interviewed until the day I left."
good,"I am in a team of employees who roam the building helping whoever we can.  We assist customers in finding item locations and answering questions.  We help cover departments when they are short.  We even help cashier.  We do it all.  My favorite part of the job is the overall friendliness of the employees with which I work with.  The hardest part of the job would probably be the amount of knowledge we on the team have to know.  Since we do not have a set department to work it, we learn bits of every one.  But it's manageable.  If all else fails, we find a specialist who is more knowledgeable.  The management varies as the managers come and go.  They have their differences, but they make it work.  All in all, a fun place to work with all the ups and downs that every business has."
good,Lowe's is actually a decent place to work for. But the Fresno Lowe's is a waist of time and energy. Know advancement possibilities Management Structure is terrible. And The Store Manager is cheap. Cuts hours all the time.
good,"semi-decent pay and awesome coworkers barely compensate for management that is overbearing and strict, and lies to you. They claim to provide advancement opportunities but even if your more than qualified for a position, and you apply constantly, they only promote the people that are close friends with management."
good,Value employees opinions though they are not often asked for.
good,"Learned alot on the job, management isnt too good. Hours arent flexible and pay is ok"
good,While I was employed there was a large number of turn over in both management and regular employees. Some of this was due to people moving on but a large number was from termination either because of personal reasons or violations.
good,warehouse distribution center that supplies their stores with product daily
good,management is terrible and the store gossips like children.
good,"The compensation beats other retailers hands down. Management is different in each store because there isn't really a solid management system that Lowe's Store Managers and ASM's are supposed to follow. Because of lack of management organization, many stores run rampant with favoritism. The biggest example would be when a store posts a new position: they may interview everyone who applied but they were already training the person they've chosen before the job was posted or interviews were made. This is especially true at my location. This makes advancement almost impossible for those who are busy working instead of brown nosing."
good,"Mostly a day at lowes is filled with redundant work where you are told to one thing and then do it again the next day.  Selling as much as you can no matter if you have no customers.  Sell sell sell, which is what makes your job go by fast.  "
good,hard work not for everyone. nice pay. sadly its now a temp hire only
good," ¬∑       Assisted with the inventory of supplies and equipment."
good,"see last post made."
good,The best part of this job would have to be working outside near the flowers area
good,"Loved working closely with local contractors and learning new things everyday. Awesome co-workers, family type enviorment. Good feeling to meet or go over companies monthy quota, and bring in new customers to benefit the company long term."
good,Very good training program.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's may be very long hours. I loved working customer service especially when it got really busy. This was a job that kept you busy doing something. People called out all the time, so I would pick up their hours and double shifts."
good,"Lowe's is a great company. The employees are generally pretty good as well. Management varies from store to store, some are awesome and some you will ask yourself how did they get their job?"
good,"I really enjoy my position as a Head Cashier. I have good relationships with the people that I work with and supervise. Most co-workers are very friendly. The thing I enjoy most about my job is the one on one interaction with employees and customers, being able to solve conflict and provide resolution. The hardest part of my job is the lack of upper management, it is difficult to do my job with out upper management backing you. Also management is more concerned with partying and/or drinking with the employees that they are supposed to supervise than running the store."
good,do not let you advance untill you have a certain time in your current position even if you show good work
good,I learned how to worked a cash register. My day was checking out people pursing items.My co workers were nice. The hardest part was learning the refunds and returns. I enjoyed clowning in the break room
good,"Promote sales to customers, assist with any questions on merchandise and recommend proper product for customers use."
good,"Inspection of items before loading into vehicle, Delivery and installation of most household appliances. Updated daily log books. Daily inspection of company vehicles. Responsible for making appointments and educating customers on assembly and operation of products. Referred customers to independent contractors for additional assistance"
good,"May not be the best management team at times, and may not stand by there word at all times but they try.... Really good HR."
good,"I respond to emails from customers regarding experiences in our Lowe's stores, problems with Lowes.com, placing orders, etc. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the general public."
good,Management usually doesn't work together. Kind of annoying. But it really depends on which store you work at.
good,Not worth to work for Lowe's because of changing the store managers. This manager is my 8th manager since I started working for Lowe's in 2006
good,"Love to build a relationship with customers looking for their ""perfect"" kitchen."
good,"Working retail your hours are never the same, and it is never guaranteed to be a busy, or slow, day. Paperwork has to be done on merchandise along with taking care of customer's needs and questions. The hardest parts of the job are the random hours. One day you can close and not get home until 10:30pm and then you have to be back at work at 5:30 the next morning. It takes a toll on a person's body; physically, emotionally, and mentally."
good,The company at one time use to take care of there employees and now that the company has grown they no longer care.
good,"Management was ok...Not sure about nternal hiring processes as company continually hired teen agers and offered them no training....pay poor, not able to stay and make a livable wage"
good,Customer service is key
good,A typical day includes the receiving and top stocking of lumber orders. Processing customer lumber orders and other transactions. Assisting customers with questions about building materials. I am also responsible for cleaning the department at the end of the day/night. Fork truck operation is a daily task through out the day.
good,"Working for this particular company Lowes was very interesting at times never the less.My position at the time was a daytime stocker working a schedule monday thru friday 4 am to 1 pm. depending on each week.I had many conflicts tho, with some of the employees that i worked with.Although i had good benefits and they gave me the 401 k plan that i nivested in for a little while.It was a very fast paced demading job to meet customers need and put products on all the shelves to produce good numbers for sales and to make budget each week and quarter."
good,"This was an easy going job with great co-workers. Managment was not to bad. They seemed to want to work with your schedule but the company polocies make it a little difficult, at least when i was their."
good,A typical day was working with a diverse group of individulas to accomplish getting deliveries complted on time. Communicating with staff to ensure they had good metric and adherance. Also to make sure they recieved theproper training to do the job assigned. I learned how to work with many types of customers and working with store to provide thebest customer service experience to fit thier needs. Managers were generally thier to assist with any issues that the supervisors were not able to do. My coworkers were difficult at times but I found in working together for a common goal help bring us together asa a team.The hardest part of the job were the long hours and being on call in the event we were short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with many differant people and backgrounds. Teaching and encouraging employees to do the best they could and assisting wioth any issues they needed help with.
good,"Great Company / Store to be organized with, Family Values, Team Orientate, Respectful, Good Working Environment, Company / Store Staff good motivators and knowledgeable within the store."
good,Sometimes busy but most of all trying to make sure all the customers are satisfied!!!
good,"Retail is Retail sometimes. Financial compensation at Lowe's isn't fantastic. Management expects a lot from some employees, not much from others. If you kiss up a lot, you CAN climb the corp ladder; if you keep your nose to the grindstone and do your job, you don't get noticed for it. The worst part of work at Lowe's (and it could be at any retail store) is the schedule: rarely does an associate get 2 straight days off. Sometimes you are scheduled 9 or 10 straight days before you get 1 day off. And you could be scheduled to close as late as 11pm one night and open the next morning at 5:30am. For the aount of compensation, it's not really worth the grief. IF the store gets a bonus, the associates (the peons who do all of the work) get, say, $250, the specialists (the sales pros) get $500, the dept mgrs get $750, the asst store mgrs get $1,500 and heaven only know what the store mgr gets."
good,"A typical day in the garden center really depends on the weather and whether it is peak season or not. Usually though the center opens at seven in the morning. I would begin by straightening everything up at and around the registers. Then sweep and organize products on the shelves. Customers tend to start coming in at around nine o'clock in the a.m. When working at Lowe's you do get a great opportunity to learn about various products and home improvement tools. Most co-workers are friendly and polite, great to work with but as in any environment there are positive and negative people. You just have to learn to ignore the negative. The hardest part of the job is learning where everything is located since there are so many products and on occasion they are relocated. Working outdoors and being able to take an hour lunch was the best aspect of the job for me. I love working outdoors and being able to leave for lunch is an added plus for sure. At the end of the day though, this is just a job as I never like to take work home with me. Enjoy."
good,My day at work is very laid back. Most days are very repetitive. I help customers choose different window coverings for their homes. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers achieve their goals in their home improvement missions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
good,during the summers it gets busy. you learn people skills. interacting with different people and questions broadens your knowledge. does not pay that well but overall its a job.
good,I loved working here during the Holiday's. Helping people get the stuff to improve their homes and decorate was amazing.
good,"i enjoyed working with my co-worker, i learned a lot of new products and items about paint"
good,"Working with Lowes and other retail establishments is very tiring. It seems all retailers never have enough help to maintain a satisfactory customer service level. They all say the customer comes first.....it just doesn't happen....when corporate tells the managers to cut back hours and lay off people....so what ends up happening.. the employees end up doing way more than there fair share and get tired and worn out and become unhappy with their jobs. As we all know most people can not afford to just up and quit. I personally get along with everyone and don't have any problems with management, other than I wish some of them would pitch in and help. Most of my co-workers work very hard as I do...but not without complaining and putting up with the customer complaints. The co-workers I have talked to all would quit if they could.....hate to say it but including myself. I am tired of being taken advantage of and pushed to hating to go to work. That's why I am looking to go back into the secretarial field"
good,"Typical day consist of clocking in, running cycle counts, front facing merchandise, maintaining a clean work environment, and taking care of your customers. Working there, I learned to operate heavy machinery and became well educated in paint and building materials among other things. Management seems to shift often. Co-workers often change departments in order to make themselves more of an asset to the company. The hardest part of the job was always taking the time to train on the computers, but still being expected to be out on the floor at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the education."
good,"Fun, outgoing and energetic group of co-worker to work with, showed employee appreciation, the managers were not always on you, the managers let you do your job, i enjoyed working with customers, staying busy when slow the toughest part of job, cut hours really bad"
good,Taking care of the customers was my number one objective regardless what issues I was faced with day to day.
good,"Management is very helpful, easy to learn , pay is good , would go back"
good,I am the Customer Service Department Manager. I manage the front end cashiers. Hardest part is schedules they are always changing. I mostly enjoy different personalities of co- worker and customers.
good,"multi-tasking between internet orders, telephone inquiries and face to faced interactions with consumers. This job has given me further experience in communicating with people whether they are customers or co-workers. I have been given the opportunity to blend new technologies such as the i-phone and internet in order to best help people accomplish their project goals. The most difficult aspect of the job is having to work without all the staffing support and feedback necessary to do the best job possible. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new and interesting people and becoming a part of their project solutions.More importantly, I get to learn new skills and ideas through that process."
good,supervised collecters
good,Management needs some serious help. They don't know how to make a schedule. Almost half of the entire staff did drugs on the property or on the job
good,I went to several departments and sold alot of special orders and never got the credit i deserved and never got advancement and i was hit by co workers and customers
good,It could be a decent career if you rub shoulders with the right people otherwise it is just a job. the pay is okay (more than minimum wage) and the job is fairly easy.
good,Okay place to work good hard working co workers and good pay but with out your experience management would fall apart no chance to advance with in company
good,It was a part time job. It was a good experience. I loved helping people and getting to know them.
good,"I learned a lot about home renovations...plumbing, electrical, etc. Some of the management was easy to get along with while others had a ""my way or the highway"" attitude. My co-workers were great, enjoyed teaching others."
good,"Good work environment, good people but hours are up and down according to season or how slow it is. Pay was good and appropriate for the job."
good,At work I had to deal with alot of yunger people not wanting to work so a lot of things didint get done on time which made everyone look bad
good,"Lowe's was my first job. I started at the bottom and worked my way up. Just lIke many other companies, Lowe's went through a restructuring. I left Lowe's and started working with Coca-cola."
good,"This job was a nightmare on a daily basis. What I mean by that is you never had any idea how much work you would have on a day to day basis. There would be days where you would come in and have absolutely nothing to do except sit and wait for work if the management staff did not immediately send you home, and there were days that would start at 5am and would not end until 10pm at night. A typical day consisted of coming in and loading up your truck of deliveries, planning your route, and performing the delivery and hook up of the products."
good,"when you come to work you dont no what the day to day will be like.Management talks to any kind of way. I not learning,"
good,Management position for Contractors and homeowners for the increase sales of electrical products.
good,Fast Pace
good,Great place to get your foot in the door and possibly get promoted
good,"Organizing and cleaning up receiving department. The importance of accuracy and efficiency. Department managers are great. but upper managers don't follow thru. The crew I work with is outstanding, knowledgeable, and efficient at the same time. The toughest part is when product can't be taken to the floor due to peak selling hours. Best part of my day is the people I work with and a sense of accomplishment."
good,"My recent employment in retail, I have quickly experienced and learned the many challenges pertaining to this industry. Currently, my management team, is virtually invisible. Which I can conclude, reflects the quality of my role."
good,You get to work and get your daily work sheet. You go to the register assigned to you. You work a five or seven hour work day with breaks and a lunch.
good,"The best job I ever had, only thing wrong was the pay. But overall it was a great company."
good,"Lowe's was a great company to start a working life at. However it was very difficult to land full-time. Even with a lot of hard work and many hours, coming in on days off, and working double shifts. It took me a year and a half to get full-time. Even then the compensation just isn't enough for someone with a family. The management team does not listen very well to their employee's and therefore no issues are taken care of. I do like working for Lowe's since it is a full-time position and jobs are hard to come by these days. I have gained a lot of experience at Lowe's such as driving heavy equipment I.E. fork lifts and narrow isle extended reach trucks. I have learned to work well with others and to deal with customers and their complaints. I have also learned how to work well with others to get tasks done. The hardest part of my job is running around trying to get everything done in a small amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the hours I get to work and seeing my co-workers every day. My typical day would involve a 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM shift. When I arrive I must bring all of my merchandise outside and set it up. Then I make coffee for commercial customers and assist any customers in the commercial area and front end. Most of the time I am loading heavy things into or on customers vehicles. When I am not doing that i must clear the lot of all carts and keep the lot clean and clear of debris. As for management I can say that they are willing to work with you when you need time off or need to leave early. That Is the biggest plus for the management team."
good,"For the most part, Lowe's appears on the surface to be a very decent company. If you avoid all of the ""office politics"", and close your ears, it can be much nicer."
good,good pay and benefits days are long and sometimes strenuous.
good,"A typical day at work was normally dull when in the paint department, unless dealing with management who did next to nothing unless they were called to override a sale or a price. I learned a lot from department managers when dealing with paint supplies that could benefit me for other jobs in the future. I had a good time with my co-workers. There were no real hard parts of the job. There were just things you needed to get use to, like changing departments when they switched me outside during March and April."
good,Lowe's is good retail store to work for. If you need a more flexible schedule with this company it is not that easy to get it.
good,"It's a good Co to work for, It's the people that run it, that make it bad"
good,"The Lowes I worked for was very low traffic, so during most of my shifts, I found myself with nothing to do. I would get pestered by other employees for not working, but after I had stocked all of the shelves, watched every supplementary training video, and assisted every customer, I was left with nothing to do but sweep a clean floor until another customer showed up. "
good,"Low pay and not a lot of hours make surviving a struggle.  The management wasn't bad, though communication seemed to be an issue at times and corporate rules for operating the store are ridiculous!"
good,Overall poor management at my location.  Colleagues were team leaders but management was insulting of former employees in front of current employees which is extremely unprofessional.
good,I used to enjoy working for this company but my leader is not someone who motivates me to do or be better. There are to many changes happening with unrealistic expectations.
good,it wasn't that difficult but at times some of the managers put  unecessary  pressure on the associates. They some times put job request that wasn't absolutely necessary at that particular time which some times took the associate away from there true department work. a lot of time most of the managers were very nice and helpful to work for but there was a couple that you could not actuall tell what direction they were in on  any givin day.
good,"not enough help to take care of customers in a timely manner. keep taking away benefits that the company once had like bonuses and rotation of hours, used to get one weekend off a month now its every 2 months etc."
good,They pay pretty good full benefits paid vacation and sick time.. but hard work during the summer there‚Äôs a truck everyday to unload and put away.  Managers are ok
good,At the Lowe‚Äôs that I worked at I filed multiple availability sheets saying that I couldn‚Äôt work on certain days but they always scheduled me on those days
good,One of the top 50 fortune company. Company always comes up with new learning activities for employees to take care of customers. Lowe's provides opportunity to advance your career.
good,You will have managers that know less than you do trying to tell you how to do your job. Pay isn‚Äôt bad at all.  Other than most of what they hire as managers the job isn‚Äôt bad at all.
good,Love the employees I work with. Your job unfortunately is not a guarantee from quarter to quarter now a days it's a coin toss. Which is bad to say being I love working for this company.
good,"Great place to work if you have a good store manager, support mid-managers and employees that are happy to help when needed. If you find a location like that it is a good workplace culture. By the way during the warmer months they have a lot of barbecues with plenty of free food and drink."
good,help customer with questions also assist customers with credit apps an online orders attend to customers returns and exchanges which was the hardest in the company and you work different hours.
good,"There have been a lot of changes at lowes with the company and the people who have worked there for a long time, not all of them positive. But I think they are trying to catch up with the future of the company."
good,"Lowe‚Äôs is a complete enigma to me   So many talented and caring co-workers, yet so many aloof and uncaring managers   Very frustrating and sad that they value money and profits over people"
good,Most team members were pleasant to work with and performed their tasks exceptionally. Management degraded over time by ignoring responsibilities and team member accountability. Customers were loyal and appreciative.
good,Benefits you can grow up to management  and have good health benefits good atmosphere for customers the managers really don‚Äôt care about employees only care about themselves
good,I would love to stay there but my current assistant manager and current department supervisor have made the front end a hostile work environment. They have their favorites
good,"It was a good place to work, however, there weren't enough hours for me to live on, working part-time, about 12-16 hours a week. I would recommend it to someone who is just starting out in the job field and is still living at home and going to school."
good,"This job is physically demanding. You are required to be on your feet for your entire shift, and the floors are straight-up concrete. If you have foot problems, knee problems, back problems, or anything else that might be aggravated by spending nine or ten hours a day standing around on concrete, this is not the job for you."
good,leaves slot to be desired. I am just a number. You can and will be replaced if you struggle. they do not care to help you along. New managers are hung out to dry. New to roll store managers think they know everything and we seem to spin on circles.
good,The company created a position without being ready for it. Very disorganized and no training. Compensation did not match job responsibilities and expectations.
good,"Morale is at an all time low. Its the one consistent thing Lowe's has across almost all of their stores. Work/Life balance has gone by the wayside. Overall, they are failing to take care of their most important asset, the front line employees."
good,"The coworkers are cool, you feel like family, and they really take care of you during the holidays as far as food in the breakroom. Management is a mess though, what you do really depends on who's working that night and how smoothly it will go, they never seem to be on the same page as each other."
good,"It's was challenging a lot driving  and lifting work in rain and 10 to 12 hours shifts and first thing in morning was the best part of the job after loading you pre called  customers to give a time manger would have to be run down first  though"
good,"I've had issues with higher management, and corporate doesn't seem to think about how their employees are impacted as long as they make more money and customer relations. However, my immediate supervisor helps us more than even the store manager wants him to, and our dept thrives and the people in it respect him and each other and enjoy what we do. The associate level is a group of people that are more like a family. If someone leaves for better opportunities they will ALWAYS mention how they miss their coworkers more than anything."
good,While I was there we had gone through so many managers and each one changed what people did it got to the point where no one knew what they were doing and I was taking on all the tasks and as well as being pulled into other areas.. I didn't mind getting pulled over to help somewhere else but they didn't care if I was in the middle of the work that needed to be done...
good,"I was a cashier. Nothing too challenging, took about two weeks before I was really proficient with their ancient registers. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my register EVER, even when I was stationed at the lawn and garden center with zero customers. You‚Äôre expected to stand for at least 8 hours a day, no chairs. It was okay as a summer job, but it got old fast. Glad I changed jobs."
good,Loved working there.  However the managers had their pets. Some people got through with a weird sense of nepotism. (sic). I would have stayed but I believe I had a target on my back for some reason. I wouldnt go back there for 100.00 per hour.
good,"The actual work is fairly easy, co-workers are great,  however management needs a lot of help with better communication.Would recommend working there but know that your supervisor may have issues with communication."
good,It was a good job to have aftet highschool and I learned about customer satisfaction. I also learned allot about products in the house and what kind of items are available at lowes
good,"Work stress at Lowe's in general is somewhat high. But that does vary by department. Working in millworks was very physically demanding, lifting 100 pound doors for people, using a mobile lift to put them on the upper shelves, having to look for said lift because its never around when you need it. Constantly having to work by myself, full 8 hour shifts, the also trying to help customers order custom built doors on outdated software with little to know training. I will say it was the best paying job I have had so far after trying to leave twice they gave me a raise, but the confluence of physical demand plus constant lack of support in my department lead to my leaving the company."
good,If you only work hard you won‚Äôt be fired. They tend to work with your schedule if it benefits both parties. It is a steady job that will make sure to place safety first
good,"Great people, the job was good with a decent salary. New CEO came in and messed up alot of things due to greed. I dont know why they even hired him, with his recent track record. Immediate supervision relocation and we got a lazy and clueless one because of the buddy buddy relationship he had with the Regional..."
good,"I enjoyed my full time and part time status at Lowe's. It was a temporary job post retirement. The work place was fun, met many new friends and learn how to work retail for the first in my career path. I work at both Hagerstown stores and enjoyed them both. Management was solid and knowledgeable. I would recommend Lowe's to anyone want to work in retail. Lowe's is going through some changes as of January 2019 with it's new CEO from Home Depot. The only negative thing I saw at Lowe's was the antiquated computer system. Hopefully the new CEO will get it straight. The are using 70's and 80's DOS tech for the large data base. It would so much easier to interacr with a Windows based program."
good,You have a lot of responsibilities in this position given the workload. The hours can be tough as they open at 6:00 AM and close at 10:00 PM. Inventory management plated a big part in my role as a department manager.
good,Upper management need help. Lowe's can not be the next Home Depot. Enjoyed my time there would rather work for Lowes's vise Home Depot. However there new HR procedure is making that choice harder. Have been waiting for position to reopen in a Virginia store
good,"Coworkers were some of the best times at Lowe's. Working as a sales specialist in the Millwork department, sales quota was easy to hit every month, however the management was lacking and if you didn't have a direct coworker willing to swap shifts with you, you could easily have a very back and forth schedule day to day. Some weeks you would have 7 or 8 days of straight 9 hour shifts anywhere from a closing shift to opening the following day (less than 8 hours between end of shift and beginning of shift) and vice versa with some mid shifts thrown in (and day to day these shifts could have been any time block, so you might open one day and then close the following day followed by another open etc etc, which was extremely common). The days off were consistently split, so you almost never had more than a single day off before having to work another 5 or 6 days. Other weeks you would have 3 or 4 days of work with 2 straight days off back to back. Also the coverage in departments was extremely lacking. I worked in the door and window department but I was across from plumbing and hardware, so if those departments were busy (common) or understaffed (EXTREMELY common) I would find myself working most of the day helping their customers and doing some of their freight. So biggest gripe would definitely be the scheduling."
good,I've worked here for about 5 years. It's an ok job with ok benefits. Corporate restructuring seems to be turning it in a different direction which has definitely pushed some great employees for jobs elsewhere. It's a great job to hold you down until you find the right career path but not to be your career unless you are getting into upper management which isn't easy. After 5 years of being told a promotion was coming and to apply for management none of those things happened. But to each their own. This place is tolerable with decent pay.
good,"It started out fine, but I feel after 11 years it's slipping into a bad place. The work is easy and fun, but the customer service is overwhelming and never ending."
good,"-Take care of yourself (mentally/physically) the job can be very overwhelming and stressful. Ive had upset customers yell at me for over an hour while the phones were ringing off the hook and other people needed to be helped."
good,This job is what you would expect out of a part time job.  Its not great pay the hours can be undesirable but the upper store management is great.  They constantly encourage and ask how you're doing.
good,"wont hire any help for department, managers always tell you something different, when asked the same question staff not knowing limit on the delivery schedule"
good,"I enjoyed my opportunity to engage with customers. While focused in one or two departments, I liked that management encouraged us to support customers across the store and departments."
good,This job didn‚Äôt really work with my schedule for that reason had to part ways I took my job very seriously but didn‚Äôt want you ruin what the company had going on with me not being able to be there certain times so I felt it was best to part ways
good,they were majority of the time down and not excited about being at work they never seem to be happy except when they got to get off and go home.The manager i was working under didn't like me but didn't treat me badly she kept it professional and treated me fairly.
good,Pays well depending on position.  Is the type of place that advancement really depends on who your manager is. Meaning if you have a good manger that recognizes your work ethic you'll move right along. If not you'll be stuck in the same spot.
good,This chain plays the favorites games by managers as most corporations do. The employees that I worked with play you stupid and their games made me quit
good,Day offs our scarce. Working everyday. Need more pay and workers period. Fun job meet new people. Same people show up everyday. You make great connections thru contractors mostly
good,"there really isn't much to tell, no real advancement opportunities but you can do you job and go home without any real hassle. the people there are great to work with"
good,It‚Äôs a good job to start out but unless you are serious in rising up within the company I wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying for a long time                      .
good,"Changing attitudes mean less and less interest in the workforce and a ongoing policy of understaffing."
good,"The work for the pay is fair. People at Lowe's are mostly friendly and helpful. Management is a mixed bag. They can be good on a personal level, but they also make a lot of promises that they don't keep. They also don't take responsibility for problems that occur. You will hear a lot of , ""Well, that's just the way it is"". If you can tolerate that and a schedule that is NOT employee friendly, then it's not too bad. In regard to scheduling, ALL part time employees are required to work EVERY weekend and EVERY holiday. They also have a habit of working you 8-10 days in a row before they give you a day off. They don't want you to have any overtime, so they will work you only 5-6 hours a shift, so they can work you up to 2 weeks without a break."
good,"A new store manager came in after I had been there over four years, he only cared about his bonus, not the employees. Lowe's as a whole good place to work, but I think the management teams is poor."
good,"When I started there as a cashier I loved it. I also met some pretty awesome people there too who are my friends still to this day. But then I got a promotion and was sent to work in home decor. I was very excited to have a new position and better pay, what I didn‚Äôt expect was that I would be running the whole department. My time in home decor could be summed up with one word. Stressful. I had one part-time person and me who worked in that department, every time I‚Äôd ask for another person they just said along the lines of ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you run the department by yourself?‚Äù When they did finally hire someone they took him out of the department and put it in another. That was another thing, this place needs more staff. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs changed since I‚Äôve been there but I know what it was like when I was there"
good,"No opportunity for advancement in the company I have been here for four years, applied for three different positions and my application was ignored twice."
good,"Customer service is top priority.  Room to move up if you like retail.  Lots of departments and areas to choose from.  Unless you are in the Garden Center or Lumber, you are in a temperature controlled store.  Need to be able to lift at least 25lbs. Safety is another priority.  Lowe's wants you to go home the same way you came in."
good,"Atmosphere at Lowes is very welcoming. If you put in the work, you will continue to have a job there. Management is poor, but where is it not in a retail environment."
good,As a part time job it may be ok but if you are looking for a full time job do not expect more than great benefits. Most working there do not get the opportunity to advance more than a department position as a customer sales associate.  After three years the total raise amount was less than a dollar from the original hired rate.
good,"The delivery team is awesome. Cool people. If you're looking for weekends off this place is not for you. Rotational schedule. Drivers average one weekend off a month. Management don't have the backs of the driver's. They have no clue what drivers have to deal with everyday. "
good,"They have a few basic training options, but it‚Äôs mostly a learn on your own time atmosphere.  The mentoring program is a joke.  They currently work on The Who you know and what you can do for them system of advancement."
good,I was hired as a part time employee with the understanding that I would eventually be promoted to full time.  Worked for 2 years and was getting between 32-39 hours per week.  New policy going into effect was going to limit my hours to 25 per week.  Was forced to relocate to a location that I hate to get a full time position.  Currently  seeking employment elsewhere.
good,"I was a sales associate. I would walk around and do what I can to help out the customers with their needs. But since I am a woman, most of the customers didn't want my help, so I mostly just walked around doing nothing really."
good,"Standing in one place not being able to leave cash register is boring. They rarely hire full time employees and even though you know your schedule in advance, they do not offer enough hours to survive on."
good,"I worked at the customer service and there was never enough people, the managers would frequently take people to ring even though we were the busiest. My last manager did little to nothing to help us at the front until customers saw her or started to complain. I was hired part-time and during the summer was nearly working 40-hour work weeks. However, when I was told things were going to calm down and I wouldn't be working as much that was not the case. I attend college part-time and tried to tell my manager I could only work up to 25 hours a week, she refused to accommodate this while not only treating me horribly personally but also misgendering me. I couldn't have any productive conversations with her and was at my wit's end, deciding to quit."
good,Most schedules are rotating.  Schedules are available 3 weeks in advance but are not consistent.  Management faces extreme pressure that rolls downhill.  If you enjoy being busy and working hard you will be happy if you can overlook the tremendous pressure from management and the inconsistent schedule.
good,It was stressful with a crazy schedule with saturdays all by yourself. I worked at the prodesk. We were often asked to help carry the lumber dept as well as manage  20 commercial accounts as well.
good,"Great managers, poor benefits, and promotional opportunities. Scheduling conflicts are the main reason for turnover rate, and it steadily gets worse with time."
good,Poor communication and upper management have led to a sharp decline in the working conditions of the Kinston Lowes. Employees are quiting as fast as they can.
good,The store was hard to work at but once I was out of the road doing my job it was a great job. They left me to do my work and only contacted me when needed. good management style of that part. otherwise a normal retail job.
good,Okay company with opportunities for growth if ambitious.  The company is changing so this place is kind of scary because you don't know what jobs are going to get cut.
good,"I enjoyed my job and my fellow employees, but a few of my managers made my work experience rather stressful and unenjoyable. My fellow staff members outside of most of the management were quite and friendly and helpful"
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 20 years and was able to provide for my family and take great vacations.  I went on maternity leave and came back for 4 months and was let go due to reduction in job force.  I worked hard and was dedicated, but it seems that did not matter.  The people in charge made poor decision, but I learned some many skills to help me today."
good,Love's used to pay commissions bonuses spiffs and was a fun place to work! then one day I came to work and all that was taken away we had to fight them to get back some of the money and the company was never the same since then. They got to where they're letting people go and closing stores it is not a stable environment beware!
good,"People were great to work there. Only problem was corporates unnecessary rules. Workplace was always clean, such as workstation and bathrooms. Most customers that come to Lowe's aren't really a pain to work with thankfully."
good,Good place over all to work but can be stressful at times and hard to manage but the people are great to work with I have enjoyed my time there for the most part
good,was very relaxed with good people to work with. Management worked with you if you had any problems or complaints. Training wasgood and very informant. I enjoyed working with customers.Lowes is a good place to work if pay was only better with full time work and benefits.my typical work day consisted of pulling appliances and other items to be delivered
good,"int the store is okay, can get very very crazy in certain departments and can be hard to get some help, customers can be extremely rude. in delivery we can work anywhere from 7am-11am ann the way to 7am-830pm and as many as 9 days in row."
good,"You have to be flexible. Not only with your schedule but with the departments. You may be in one department then pulled to another. Pay raises are terrible! Your not gaurenteed a pay raise. "
good,"As a cashier, I just basically stand there all day, wait for people to check out, and the more people you get, the faster it goes. You are not allowed to sit at the front end cash registers (technically not at all unless you have a medical accommodation), but you can weasel your way into a chair down at Lumber or Outdoor Lawn and Garden registers, where you're pretty much by yourself, employee-wise, and head cashiers/managers aren't looming over your shoulder about it. "
good,"They Discriminate worked there on 2 Separate Occasions and because my name is unique they didn't want to advance me after they promised me they would typical day show up at 350am shift started at 4 wait around until receiver Manager checks out The store that's last about 10minutes manager unlocks inside door and greets employees at The door,you get to login and you rush to locker room get your vest on and you Rush stocking shelves until 6am when it's break Time  that's lasts fifteen minutes and you resume stocking shelves until .you logout and go home"
good,I learned about customer service. How to drive a forklift and other power equipment. So of the management was nice and some did not know how to speak to employees. Hardest part of the job is haveing people just walking around not helping the customer and not helping out other employees. The letters or calls the customer would let corporate know how we gave them great customer service.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. Unfortunately they are now enforcing you only get 1 weekend off every 8 weeks you work. I fully understand retail is an open availability commitment. Which I do have but with that and the fact they hire outside instead of promoting within I need to look elsewhere.I have a great management team and I will be sad to leave. But I have 2 daughters that need more of my time.
good,This is a job not a career. Management has a new focus and it‚Äôs not the employees that is why you don‚Äôt see long term employees anymore they all left for better companies.
good,poor management air conditioning doesn't work Job discription changes constantly. Management requires more and more output production. Poor daily schedule
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow employees.  Safety conscience environment.  Compensation is far below today's standards for what is expected from employees.  Too many job cuts in recent years leading to no sense of job security.
good,"Require patients  and alertness must learn how to operate three machines the order picker, fork lift, and reach truck good place to learn receiving work."
good,"This is retail, so the hours were never good. Depending on your knowledge of certain products, this job was either good or bad depending on the day and what department you were working in."
good,"Mandatory overtime "
good,The expectations were high when no other help would be provided. Most of the workload was heavy on the day stockers. Management is very unorganized and there is hardly any communication among each other. The job position is manageable. The hours are workable. The coworkers are nice to talk to. It can get stressful. If you do what you are supposed to do without anyone interrupting (that being customers and other associate/managers) then the job will not feel pressured.
good,Would have stayed longer if they would have hired me full time great experience working I. The paint dept. Learned a lot from their products and how to apply them and makes sales
good,It was my first job that I actually worked for a big business. I learned valuable communication skills is important when speaking with costumers and to make sure I know as much as possible to help them as much as possible.
good,"Hire you for part time saying about 10 hrs but schedule you up to 39 1/2 hrs per week."
good,"Constantly ringing phones and customers asking for things. Multi tasking is a must. Working in a fast pace environment is essential. The store culture will depend on store to store. I know my store has a pretty good culture in the sense that the management team is genuinely concerned about the employee as well as the operation of the business. "
good,There are many opertunities the store has to improve. The company itself is far behind the times when it comes to technology which makes everyone's job more difficult. There are many improvements the company as a whole needs to make in order for that store to be successful
good,"It's a ok job for high school students or college students but the schedule is not ideal for having family.The benefits  are good in comparison to other retail jobs but the pay was not exceeding  cost of living in the north east. Most enjoyable part of work was interaction with customers and coworkers repeat customers that look for you. Hardest part"
good,The workload is stressful and there are not enough employee. Schedules are not supporting work/life balance. the only hourly wage for CSR but expecting to work as specialists. training is the minimum possible.
good,"I had a seasonal cashier's job, so I had a set schedule. They didn't want us to clock in a few minutes early, because they didn't want to pay overtime."
good,"While the pay was fair for a retail sales position, the varying schedule makes it difficult to find a good work-life balance. The hours for the part time position could be as little as 10 hours per week and as many as 39; overtime is highly discouraged."
good,"Lack of communication and too many people involved in a relatively easy process led to a lot of frustration. Enjoyed working outside of the store and the people I worked with,"
good,I worked for Lowe's for almost 13 years and was laid off.  Employees used to be treated very well but benefits and bonuses lowered during the time I worked there.
good,"I really loved my job and my customers, when I worked for Lowes. I would have retired from there if I had not gotten terminated.My biggest weakness is caring to much."
good,lowes its self is not a bad company to work for. Just the store I work for is unprofessional and a stressful environment to work in. the mangers have favorites which also makes it hard to work at.
good,"It is an easy job, need to have patience, and a positive attitude always. The easiest part of the job was checking out the customers and bagging their items. Also, putting away snacks, and restocking drinks was fun."
good,its a job and I thank GOD EVERYDAY FOR MY JOB. I love what i do and helping people is something I love to do. But the only thing is that full time cashiers isn't something they offer much and thats a downfall i DO BELIEVE.
good,"Thisbis the most stressful enviorment to work in,with poornmanagement  and unfair treatment.They will lie tonyoubwith a offer to move to a different department or even force you and dont even up your pay or anything.You get hurt and they dont care you still gone work."
good,"The difference of 10 years is quite large. When I started working for this company in 2009, employees earned commission on all special order products and appliances and at Christmas every employee received $35. In the past 5 years, the commission went away, the money bonus at Christmas changed into an extra 10% off for a week, and many positions have been eliminated with more yet to come. Lowe's used to be a pretty decent place to work, now a lot of people I know that have been working for the company for years are losing their jobs because they have decided to become more third party related from everything dealing with deliveries to the daily cleaning of the store."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for 10 years. In that time I have been through so much tumult that led to so little improvement that I can't understate it. "
good,I worked as a PSI and as a cabinet specialist for Lowe's. The PSI role was far better than working as a specialist but it still wasn't great. We were pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals.
good,"two week schedule that on a daily basis was changed mostly with out my knowledge, Corp personal sales goal were exceeded by more then 25% so I was told I needed to take some of the sales goals off the other sales men so that on top of my sale goals I would also have an ""off the books extra sales goal"". Managers where constantly dropping the ball on customer service issues and then would shift the blame to the departments when for the most part they all would hide in the offices and only really cared about their $5,000 to $25,000 quarterly bonuses  where as sales associates get maybe 300 to 600 and norm associates really get screwed all while cutting Full time positions to near to zero and part slots working 24 hrs a week all and all it's another big box Walmart  styled company that is only interested in making as much money as possible with the least amount of staff at pay rates that are still jokingly low"
good,"Working at Lowe's you'll have to be quick on your feet, learn as much as you can and be able to reiterate it whenever necessary. A lot of times what you are trained for and what is required are completely different. Every employee is expected to work hard and help out neighboring departments, however in order to do that on the job training is required. Customer interactions will teach you more about the skills needed for your job than the online training so it's best to ask questions and figure out the best way to meet the customer's objectives."
good,It was great starting out but with all the changes happening right now it‚Äôs gone to heck. Not only are you overworked but things promised to you are never delivered upon. There are a few good managers but most either don‚Äôt care or get stressed out too easily. The coworkers are all great people though and that‚Äôs why I stayed so long.
good,"Been with Lowe's 15+ years, with all the management changes and benefit cutbacks, I would recommend it now as a temporary gig. I no longer feel valued by the company as an experienced, long term employee."
good,The Company goes through too many changes. It needs to get an identity and stick with it. Too many shifts in upper management positions. Taking HR out of stores just alienates the employee from the company. Lack of a culture of fostering employee development.
good,This place is a great place to work for someone that is getting into a starting place in the work field. Can be difficult for students. Requires a flexible schedule to work well for someone.
good,I was hired for seasonal work. They don't let you put in for other departments if they see you're an asset for the department you're in. It's also who does the work that they put the most work load on.
good,"I worked weekend shift. The people were decent but the workday (12 hr. shift) seems like it will never end, especially when the weather is hot. The work itself is mostly hard physical labor. If you're not in shape the work will get you in shape, I lost 50 lbs. in less than a year. If you can't keep up physically, they will get rid of you. Turnover is quite high, you're constantly meeting new co-workers. Chances for advancement are slim, but if you're ambitious you will get to learn many different jobs. The pay is decent for this area, but most workers have a second job or attend college on weekdays. Management talks about safety quite a bit, they really harp on it. Like most of these companies, Lowe's is very anti - labor union, they make that clear during new-employee orientation."
good,A great company to work at and raise a family.  Worked at 21 years and was very happy with my experience.  Deployed 3x times while there and each time treated me like a hero when i returned.
good,Lowe's offers a variety of positions.  Many are not work /life balance friendly.  Hardest part of the job is creating a strong workplace culture.  Every position at Lowe's requires every employee to be part of the team for them to succeed.
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for but little growth from within , Even with alot if change over they would promote from the outside . We have had 4 store mangers in a 3 year period."
good,"When I came to Lowe's over 5 years ago the company was great, the environment was friendly, helpful, like family.  New CEO and corporate management changed all that and made it a chore to come to work, stressful, cut throat and not worth the headache of dealing with the heavy workload to be treated like a number.  Employees mean nothing to the corporation."
good,Been in retail a long time. You have you basic people who do nothing and manage to keep their jobs while others work hard and pick up the slack. It is retail. Same everywhere. Everyone seems to start as seasonal and they don't rush to promote.
good,"As with any job in retail there are a ton of ups and downs, this Lowe's has managed to keep those fairly consistent. Most everyone works as a team and it is encouraged to do so"
good,"Can be fast paced at times. You need to multitask on a regular, if not you will not get a lot of work accomplished. Can be fun at times. There are clicks but of course they are everywhere."
good,"The company itself isn‚Äôt bad to work for. The company gives you options, and has good customer incentives. The stores, on the other hand, are run badly. Managers are hardly around, they don‚Äôt answer phones, and the favoritism is awful. There are coworkers in supervisory positions who try to get other employees fired so they can see how many people can quit because of them. I was pregnant and coworker spent my entire time there trying to get me to quit or get fired."
good,Just seeing people happy to get their product made the day worth while. There will be some good and bad days but you have to make sure that the customer gets the best experience you can give.
good,"The training is subpar. I learned more from customers than from my training, but if you want to learn about all the different departments you have to ask a lot of questions and make it a point that you want to learn, otherwise people will just do the job for you, and it is okay sometimes, but sometimes it is not that good to be dependent on people. Schedules were a big problem. The system sometimes gave people two weeks off, so you always need to be updating a manager on that situation, but it could be good if you handle it the right way. You have a lot of opportunities to get overtime but only because they are constantly understaffed. If you are looking for a job to have something to do then this is the job for you. There are good benefits and it can be pretty relaxed. When I worked there it seemed very lenient on senior team members with physical activities, but if you are in your youth, get ready to lift although even that is not a big deal as long as you are safe and not the only associate available with the ability to lift boxes of nails or toilets."
good,Our new ASM choses favorites daily. She will never comment on anyone else breaking dress code but she will dress code me and one other person constantly checking for rips and minor problems. When shes around im 5x more likely to get introuble for something another person could do and recieve no consequences. I know of other employees who are late daily but if im late i get written up.
good,"Lowe's is hard honest work."
good,"The managers punish those who work and reward those who don't. They will burn you out and make you hate your position. The people that work there were a massive benefit, good people that cared about one another."
good,"Working at Lowes was great- Genuinely enjoyed my time there. Loved my coworkers, I enjoyed two of my supervisors very much, but the management was terrible. Manager was being incredibly inappropriate to the point of it affecting my job and hours. Corporate did nothing about this and it totally ruined my experience. Not to mention, the managers are now HR, so its a huge circlejerk of managers doing whatever they want and getting away with it. It's disgusting."
good,"When I worked at Lowe‚Äôs I learned a lot about teamwork. I learnt that being an adult isn‚Äôt easy. I kind of learned how to balance school, work, and life."
good,"Started off working the whole store, all departments, twenty hours per week, then migrated to plumbing where I have been the past two years or so.  Enjoyed the associates I worked with and the management staff.  Lowe's is a seasonal employer and there have been many weeks where I have been scheduled less than ten hours."
good,"Poor management."
good,My experience with Lowe's is Fun and they co-ordinate my request time availability well. I enjoy working at Lowe's and my co-workers. I have learn a few professional way of dealing with customer as a Front cashier.
good,"Good teamwork, Bad Upper Management."
good,"They have good retirement plans as well as room for growth, but it‚Äôs sometimes all who you know @ Lowe‚Äôs and not what you know. Sometimes can be a cut throat environment."
good,Job is fun and I like the co-workers but shift is hard to get used to. Every employee only gets one weekend off a month. The hardest part of the job is the hours because they are different every day and the six days straight after your weekend are rough.
good,"Typical day is down stocking merchandise, color matches,take customers over to their designated area for their products, make sure there is coverage for lunches and breaks, put away returns, handle customer complaint then call management."
good,There is a new direction with the company and my position wasn't in it. They are trying to get out of the installation division to avoid all the legal liability and just focus on the product.
good,After 5 years of working Lowes it's one thing I can say is that I'm really burnt out. Things just don't really seem to change that he consistently offer Advanced man and then take away positions just to add under qualified people to fill holes in the scheduling and barely any of that. Great benefits really good 401K plans but the overall work-life aspects is pretty big drag don't reslly feel free she ate it in or do you feel needed kind of just a body to get an agenda done
good,"Merchandizing projects, Planograms maintenance, display signage maintenance, execute merchandizing strategies and ensure products are displayed correctly to drive sales."
good,"Not the worst spot to work,but management at the store could definitely be better, there are the few good ones. Store manager doesn't do anything to help anyone, ever. Payroll constantly cut so pay drops and hours are inconsistent if you're part time. Depending on the department you work pretty easy job, just know ur department."
good,There is potential in growing in the company. Co-workers are great and family oriented. Makes going to work something to look forward to. Management is flexible.
good,They pay you what you're worth but then work you to death. Sometimes working anywhere between 6 days to 23 days ( different person from there) without a day off in between. Some managers are awesome but others are hardly ever seen or heard from if you need them. My department is pretty stressful at times but overall air between everyone is like family we all look out for each other.
good,I loved working for the company except for the job stress. I was over the frontend for two years. The stress started getting to me and affected my health but they wouldn‚Äôt let me transfer departments
good,"You will work with some great people.  However, you must find satisfaction in never ever fully completing anything.  Constant change in policy and operations.  Flexibility is key.  Must have a love for helping people solve problems.  Must be thick skinned when dealing with the public.  If you wear your heart on your sleeve this is not the place for you."
good,"Lowes cares nothing about its associates, you are just a number to be used , abused then discarded. Very cliquish, if you are not a kiss up you can forget it. Training is completely nonexistent, it‚Äôs a sink or swim environment. The less you do the more you are rewarded. The bonus program is a joke. Everyone is out for themself. The word teamwork does not exist at Lowe‚Äôs, you are completely on your own."
good,"Enjoyed working there, learned alot I wouldn't know if it didn't take the chance to work for them. Not always the laid back job people think it is...."
good,"Keeping this short, I would say that your immediate coworkers will make or break your work experience. Mine were great, and are still some of my good friends. However, if you have other things going on outside of work (school, family, kids etc) or you give them your availability in writing, dont expect them to follow it. There is also a huge lack of direction in management, as well as a sheer lack  of professionalism. expect to get 3 or 4 different sets of instructions if you ask multiple people"
good,"Lowes and other large retailer stores are really a ""luck of the draw"" deal when you are applying to one. I recommend doing pre-survey research with employees there and online."
good,"Nearly every year, Upper Management changes to Company's Goals and Policies which leads to confusion at the store level. Decent Pay for the work required, no in-store HR Support."
good,"Before I started, there were 3 load pullers and a delivery coordinator, and 2 of the load pullers quit before I got hired. Then the delivery coordinator quit. Then the last load puller quit. So now I am the only one in my department."
good,"Working at Lowe's has good and bad same as any place, I will point out that schedules are terrible with constantly changing at your managers whim and the time of day you work jumping from 4am-1pm to 6am-3pm to 10am-7pm to 1pm-10pm or any random combination."
good,Managers stick together and won‚Äôt help you when in need. Great co workers new management would be advised. Better training would be a plus also. Won‚Äôt go back.
good,"sometimes have special events for employees all and all fairly decent place of employment,hardest part about job is being understaffed best thing is certain managers,co workers and my clientele i have developed"
good,"Where do I start. People were getting hired in at a higher rate than the current staff was making. Was told ""it's against company policy for you to know that."" The younger ones were given preferential treatment, from management looking the other way when they were running around the parking lot playing Pokemon Go, giving them weekends off and understanding when they called hungover on Sunday morning. Some of the cashiers slept with anything that moved, managers co-workers customers it didn't matter. So I guess great place to work if you're young. Not so much if you're older and more mature."
good,Lowe's offers a wide variety of benefits that makes being a part of Lowe's enjoyable. Lowe's is a hard place to advance in unless you're connected to upper management.
good,Great culture among the staff. This was not a great fit for me overall and I moved on to a better cultural fit. Learned a few things in the process about myself and moved on.
good,"The co workers really become like family but with being a mom of 3, we ran into scheduling issues, and I felt like I was being asked to choose a job over my children."
good,Lowes is a very fast paced place to work and requires that associates be able to multitask and be positive no matter what is going on around you. Also is stressful.
good,For me it's a little hard to manage work life and personal life due to my position. The hours are so different on a day to day basis. Management is different throughout the store sonit really depends on what department you are in for what you will deal with
good,"There is nothing to review, the experience was not very good overall and I would not want to work at that store ever again. The sales manager was not a good manater"
good,There is a lot of opportunity to learn how to use the products that Lowe's provides. They offer training classes for different departments. They promote from within the company so there us room for advancement.
good,"Lowe's is a convenient place of commute for me. Although, I wish to gain more income hourly and receive a full time position, it gives me a chance to refresh my skills in hardware."
good,"Lowe's works with student schedules pretty well since they are usually PT and they don't seem to mind when hours are cut to 10-12 hrs per week....There is little to no communication between management & staff. You can get away with anything without fear of being reprimanded. This is great for those that take 30-45 min paid breaks, spend HOURS (not a typo) of the day on their cells, hide in low traffic areas of the store, and avoid job duties. Some managers are great, but so overwhelmed they just don't have time to support their staff. It is supposed to be all about the customer though, and it is. Any concerns by the employees are seen as negativity, so eventually they just give up and don't care anymore. That's bad for morale and affects work/life balance. It does help in a way that so many people are affected...at least they aren't alone. I know it's all about the money like any large corporation & we all have choices about where we work. I would suggest that you make Lowe's a stepping stone toward a career that makes you feel more valued."
good,"fairly enjoyable family style work place."
good,"Lowe's has always had it's up and downs over the years. It's been a great place to work, but management always seem to never recognize the lack  of morale  among employees (or they are in denial). And the reason for the lack of morale is they expect so much out of the employees and drag many people through the mud doing it. They never hire on enough employees even though there is enough payroll to do so. They will always point out out the negative, but rarely give out a ""good job"" , or ""l appreciate your hard work""  and it's sad that it had become this. I have gotten so much experience in my position though, and know that I can handle stressful situations because of them...so I guess that's good."
good,Overall the compensation and benefits are among the best you will find in a retail setting. The lack of managerial support from Assistant Managers and Store Manager is the key problem. Without that support you are set up for failure and the view is as a Support Manager you are only suppose to work 10% and Supervise 90%. That is the fatal flaw with this company.
good,Difficult management made hours and collaborations more difficult. Often working on projects or areas on your own which can make the experience chaotic. Often seeking overtime with strenuous jobs and achievement.
good,"Never enough workers for evenings, too many evening shifts demanded to work"
good,"I worked in the Seasonal Dept. We sold all types of fertilizers, Lawn and Garden equipment,plants,trees, furniture. I enjoyed this job. I like to help people.The culture was fast paced but pleasant.Th hardest part of the job was the low pay."
good,"Great people to work with. Some mangers were great some not so. Always short handed but the work got done. One day working in assigned area , next day somewhere else.  Worked on home deliveries a lot as that dept. is always short handed, A lot of transporting heavy home appliances upstairs ( several floors) with no elevators. The appliances have to be taken apart with no instructions and put back together or doors to homes have to be removed and replaced.  There should be a question to buyers on how easy it is to enter the residence. Got injured on a home delivery and had to have surgery. Not one phone call or anyone stopped by to see how your doing.  Had to go in every week with doctors report, very cold. Doctor would not release back to work due to surgery. Between HR and insurance carrier lost the job. Real nice, they care !"
good,"Regardless if you‚Äôre a customer service associate or merchandise service associate, customers come first.  "
good,"Great part time gig if you do not need set hours. Management at our store was awful after the restructure. I had to leave in order to make a living. I couldn‚Äôt work 30 hours one week and have 12 the next. My coworkers were great and I miss them dearly. Unfortunately the pay was better than most but it was very discouraging knowing new people were coming in at what took you years to make. Also, there was no advancement opportunities unless you were close to hr. Management turns a blind eye to employees bullying others."
good,"no comment for the reasons you hire right people for the wrong departments and I don't see how that benefits everyone working or worked for!  "
good,"For Wilkesboro it is one of the top places for work. If you have a good supervisor you will succeed. The job itself is stressful and redundant. Co-workers are always nice and willing to help. Job security it terrible, one never knows if they will be on the chopping block next."
good,"It was fun at first, but after the season hit it was nothing but drama. Anything from co-workers making things up to customers trying to put their hands on me. The Lowe's I worked at needs security detail to protect us from customers who want to get physical over petty things such as discounted dirt or clearanced plants."
good,"Rotating shifts , not a work life balance at all."
good,Inconsistent hours. Not all employees are held to the same standard of work ethic. Processes are not well explained and all computer input is extremely non-user friendly.  Company bends over backwards for customers but employees are poorly treated.
good,"I've been working there for Lowe's for 8 weeks,there has been at least 15 people fired or quit in that time that I know of. I am scared of losing my job with this company. The management is horrible can't trust any of them."
good,"Fast paced job, high turnover especially with front end employees, seemed to always be short staffed through out store, advancement opportunities are plentiful, military veteran friendly company"
good,It‚Äôs ok for awhile but then you want to move up. It has its ups and downs. Overall it‚Äôs a decent place to work. Happy to be there at the moment. Hoping pay increases eventually.
good,"Lowe's can be a fun place to work. Depending on job the pay can be a big issue if you like nice things in life. If you have a family to support and personal home bills like- mortgage , car notes, kid's going to college, regular house hold bill's, or jus trying to save a dollar for a rainy day ; then you will likely need a second job and pray they work wit your schedule! They didn't work wit mine!"
good,"I had great customer service training and cross training, so enjoyed moving around a lot as needed.  Loved the co workers.  It was difficult to find managers for assistance.  Head Cashiers were ran all over the place trying to keep up assisting with cashiers scattered in all the departments.  During ""off peak"" hours customers had difficulty getting assistance which was upsetting for them.  Terrible scheduling, no day/night shifts.  Being scheduled to clopen was exhausting and very hard on the body.  Schedule was all over the place.  I think they would be able to have less of a turnover if there were set day and night shifts.  People prefer being able to choose."
good,"I was hired as a CDL Driver at Store 1071, Highland Heights, KY. Job was fun, but very physically demanding. The other delivery drivers were great, but management does not back you up at all. Supposed to be capped st 9 deliveries per truck per day, but routinely get 14-16 stops put on your truck. As well as the added ""emergency"" runs managers would force you to do. Overall, not a horrible place to work, but just not my preferred working environment."
good,it was a fun place to work but the store was all over the place. management did not know how to talk to staff. work was not good which is why lowes has a turn over rate.
good,"I work 8 hours a day at a cubicle, on the phone with customers, stores and installers. It is a high stress job without opportunities for advancement. There are hundreds of people in the office so it is difficult to improve as an individual."
good,Cashiers cannot get full time.  Hours are irregular.  Occasionally you'll get up to 25 hours per week but usually 10 to 12 if you're lucky.  Plenty of good cashiers wanted more hours but instead they hire more people.
good,"Some customers made the job fun and enjoyable. Management wasn't great, unless they saw you as one of their pets. Hardest part of the job was coworkers and some of them not doing there jab and having to cover for them. What I learned is watch what you say to people because some people take things too literally or too sensitive and can't handle constructive help."
good,The salary you are paid does not match the amount of work you are expected to do. Vacation & sick time are pretty good. Benefits offered by the company are also decent.
good,"Good pay, most everything else sucked. Lack of care for the workers from management and a lack of care for overburdening workers with the tasks of multiple individuals. A few good people and a few good mangers did not make up for the rest of the stores set backs."
good,"Assisting customers for their home improvements. Rotating stations of jobs usually by lending a hand to another coworker for customer support. Management was around when you asked for them, but usually busy doing their duties in the office."
good,"Started out full time as a Delivery Driver, but due to economy was transferred inside the store working part time. Great job, but no hours. This excluded me from full benefits, plus not enough money to support my faimily."
good,"Started as a great place to work, but there is a lot of negativity now. It would be nice if upper management could change that culture."
good,Liked solving the customers problems. Adding value to the sale. The flex time is great and gives time to family. You also keep the store front and faced for the customer as well as down stocking.
good,"High paced work environment, Learned high standard of customer service and to use one judgment when assisting with customer issues. Hardest part of job is meeting some unrealistic expectations."
good,"It paid the bills, the managers were not understanding and they have a major attitude problem with employees. I would only go back if that was my only option."
good,"I worked at Lowe's for what seemed like an eternity. Used to be a fun place to work. But depending on how good your store manager was and ASM's would dictate how your work environment would be. Could be   "
good,"Lowes is a good job to have, they will work with you but at the same time as an unloader they dont really care that much, i have been hit in the head with boxes while unloading the truck but never was able to go home and rest and some of the managers are not that nice about 1 or 2 of the managers up there are chill, also we work till the truck is done without lunch but it is under 5 hours. I do like the job i just hate when they have 2 trucks for us and the second truck shows up at the time my shift is supposed to end or management doesnt send help like they say they will, i dont plan on leaving Lowes cause i do like the job"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowes because the people I worked with were a lot of fun to be around. The hours were inconsistent and the pay was minimum. If you are just needing some extra cash then Lowes is the place to work but you need money to pay bills, eat and get gas then I would not recommend Lowes."
good,"Working at Lowe's as both a part-time associate and then a full-time associate I can honestly say that it is perfect for a part-time employee. The work required is not extremely difficult however can be stressful when your work load piles up and there is no one else in your department to help. My department is internet fulfillment and I am required to pull all online pick up orders that come throughout the day. Some days I have as little as two orders for the whole day but during special events and holidays I can be required to pull over thirty. Some orders are small and can be as simple as a screwdriver and others as much as an entire bathroom renovation which can include everything from the drywall and insulation to the towel ring. Regardless of the size of the order I am required to grab all the products in a set time frame. Not all products are easy to find and require searching an entire department for the right product. If the department I am searching makes a mistake with their inventory by entering one wrong number as a product, then it can throw the entire inventory off and say that we have a lot of one product when in reality we have none. While pulling orders I am also expected to watch the desk for when a customer comes to pick up their orders as well as assisting customers throughout the store and answering phone calls. If I am on the other side of the store it can take a couple minutes to make my way back to my desk and even longer if on power equipment. In between orders I also need to complete bay audits that requires organizing pulled orders and contacting customers"
good,"Lowe's is one of those jobs that you will feel comfortable at first, but later on you will realize that there is clear favoritism by management over actually hard work. The annual raise is literally maybe 30 cents. Only way to get and actual raise is to apply for a position in a different department than what they put you in to begin with. In my case even though I started as a lawn and garden loader and have been moved multiple times to ISLG /OSLG  to fill holes in the schedule and applied to be for full or part time position. They would chose someone who has no experience what so ever in a home improvement store over and me and pay them more. Having all certifications for powered equipment does not not get you a raise whatsoever. Truly wish things are able to change in this store or it will eventually fall apart."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for as an hourly employee, but becomes very stressful as a manager.  If you enjoy working with the public in a typical retail environment, go for it, if not, look elsewhere."
good,I was gratefully for the job and benefits but the lack of pay for the people that do all of the work is not great. And your work week can run for 8 or 9 days without a day off because of the pay week
good,"Hard work and good leadership are treated fairly, until they are not.  The company's new executive structure has caused a great deal of turnover so the equity and relationships built with past leaders mean nothing, and it seems of late that promotions are awarded politically rather than based on logical qualifiers."
good,Grateful for the opportunities I've been afforded with this company.  I have held a few positions within the company.  I enjoyed my career for the most part.
good,"The over all culture at the Harrisonburg VA., Lowes was helpful.  For the most part associates helped one another out and were not afraid to step out of their department to help another associate out.  During my time there corporate was trying to implement a lot of changes, in particular to supervisor positions, I believe the tension that was caused by that has gotten a bit better.  As a seasonal associate in retail, like most places you don't get many benefits, but the pay is not bad & the opportunity for over time occurs quite often.  Over all the working environment was helpful, but by being in retail you have a lot of people there temporarily."
good,I enjoyed working customer service while employed at Lowe's.  I always tried to make sure that when the customer left that every need was met. It's a nice place to work if you are young or in college.
good,A lot of good employees. Learned from other employees not always from management. One hour lunch/dinner break. Large company that the top does not care about the bottom.
good,"The staff is nice, but still have your buddy buddy rats. Long works days, no incentive to stay longer than needed. Work week starts on Saturday, so you can be booked for 6-7 days straight. Upper management seem like they are drowning from stress."
good,"Management is not the best. Very little information is important to the majority of employees, and whatever we happen to care about, such as cuts in hours and new policies, we don't get told anything, or misleading information."
good,Lower level management at this company is over worked and under paid.  All stores run under staffed so management is needed to cover sales floor duties in addition to their own job.  If one or the other fails it falls on that person.
good,"While at Lowe""s, my managers were always very flexible and willing to work with my schedule while I was in school. I enjoyed the work environment. lots of freedom."
good,"My direct supervisor in receiving was horrible. Did not treat employees fairly, ignored me half of the time, and did not offer any training worth knowing. If not for her I probably would‚Äôve stayed with the company."
good,The pay was good but the work place was not. Some people ;ove working in that environment I did not. I did not care this job enough to have to type this many words about it.
good,"getting  a full  forty  hour work week was few and  far between. Being  a delivery  driver  had many  uncontrollable  factors  such  as  weather, sales,"
good,"Job but not a serious career. Not enough opportunities to grow in the company.  People who do move up do so by politics and high-fiving the right people rather than hard work, job performance and having good attendance."
good,"Executive leadership is on the right track, but it hasn't trickled down yet.  There is quite a bit of potential for Lowe's in the future I think though."
good,"Very clickish when it comes to managers. The last one I had there decided I needed to be fired for attendance, despite the fact I was under a Drs care and was on intermittent leave. I was good at my job and I produced when I was there. And my Human Resources lady got in trouble for helping me."
good,No advancement or transfer opportunist  yes it is great to work full time but as a full time cashier you have nowhere else to go but down cause it seems the don't care you are just a number and are easy replaced
good,"The scheduling was not favorable and many folks were tardy or called out continuously and management did not address or correct the problem."
good,"I did seasonal work for Lowe's. The hours were alright, but the management wasn't all that great. Cashiers had to get carts from the parking lot in all weather."
good,"There‚Äôs up and downs. Great people to work with. Great customers to help. But at the same time, I need something better. With better pay and better advancement opportunities"
good,There are some things that could be done better to improve the work-life balance aspect of it there needs to be more of an effort placed into improving future managers to step into leadership roles.
good,"A typical day can range from insanely busy to the point you can hardly catch your breath to not a single customer in the store for hours at a time. This largely depends on the day of the week and time of year. Spring is the busiest; winter is the slowest."
good,The coworkers are great.  Lowe's new direction makes it very difficult to move up and pay is not very good.  Many positions are being eliminated. Schedules are terrible for managers and sales floor associates.
good,they do not seem to care about your family life and wait until the last minute to tell you that you have to work overtime..upper management is terrible
good,"I'm not sure if it was just location I worked at, but my management was horrible. If you needed help they would just walk on by. It was impossible to advance within the company. One of my former coworkers applied for the same position 3 times before she even got it. I applied for the customer service position about a good 5 times and never got it even though my supervisor kept scheduling me over there instead of being a cashier. I always kept getting the same lame reason as to why I didn't get the position. They claimed it was ""The way I interviewed."" I was great in customer service! A lot of the employees even suggested to management that I deserved the position over another employee that was horrible at it, but that person ends up getting it. My husband worked at the same location before I did, and got treated the same way."
good,"typical customer service, management was alright at some points, not always fair.  the environment was alright when everyone got along, but its similar to highschool, people tended to group off."
good,Good job for students in college.    A great job to learn how to operate different machinery.  A great place to learn how to interact with coworkers and costumers.
good,"you have to be a college graduate now if you want to advance. unknown what degree is needed to advance. great place to work if you like to work in a warehouse environment. cold in winter, hot in summer"
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing the details of the electrical department and being able to relate my knowledge to our customers when it was applicable.  I learned how to relate to all kinds of people and help them make decisions about their purchases."
good,As a whole the company has its strengths and also the is some opportunities as well.  I seen very appreciative of the opportunity to work for the company.
good,Lowes is one of the best company‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever worked for when it came to them working with my schedule and family life. Work life was sub par depending on who you would end up working with but overall a decent job for someowhone who is starting out in the sales industry.
good,"Managers can be a pain to deal with sometimes.  It's a fairly easy job, with good benefits, and teamwork oriented. I recommend working at this company."
good,It‚Äôs a great job to have but the managers are really slack. You have at least three that do work and the rest are lazy. Barely see the store manager and one of the managers is very slack
good,we delivered appliances to customer you worked a day shift and an evening shift every week you had weekend and had to work on most holidays had to deal with all kinds of weather to get your job done.
good,"Lot of change there over past few years which leads to changing priories and vague/absent strategic direction.  They're on a good path to prune the fat and get efficient, but not enough being done to lead employees through the change."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting new clients, helping with projects and building a rapport. My co workers are all great people from all different back grounds."
good,"no comment.lunches were taken in between delivery`s if time aloud.It was good i was able to drive both types of trucks,so it never got boring.most delivery`s were good but sometimes you would get a real bad one that would take you in to the wee hour`s of the night."
good,"A typical day- I walk in and no one knows what's going on for the day."
good,Lowes is a very determined safe place to work safety is there number one value which should be the case for all work environments it home work life is ok the pay doesn‚Äôt really compete with others around
good,"served customers, answered plant related questions, managed cash drawer"
good,Long hours. Fast pace. Poor management. They took everything personally. No one took ownership of their mistakes. The lazy employees always got ahead. Hardwork goes unnoticed.
good,"Fast-Paced with little help. Little or no opportunity to advance, Seniority has no advantages with no extra benefits such as a better schedule or better pay. Management seems to accommodate part-time and new hires with what their scheduling needs, instead of rewarding dependable, seasoned and loyal staff with better schedules. Hard working employees are asked to do more while the break room in full of the same faces.Management is always in constant change."
good,"Good company to work for and gain management experience. The company is changing so much so quickly, it is hard to consider any job secure at the moment. Pay is decent, overtime is offered. Work/life balance is minimal."
good,More negative than positive buy hey it's retail what do expect? A typical shift includes being treated like garbage by about 10 percent of customers and an idiot by your incompetent manager (not all of them just mine). They typically like to delegate responsibilities even if it means taking more time to inconvenience another employee (Thereby shorting the staff of a different department) when they could've just performed the menial task they want someone else to do themselves. LEAD FROM THE FRONT and by example enough said. The only truly positive I will give them credit for is their new Track to the trades program. Look into it.
good,"Consistent, steady employment until restructure of Loss Prevention which negatively impacts many employees lives.  Work schedule varies greatly and negatively impacts work/life balance."
good,"At Lowe's, I did not have the best of times. Due to the ambiguous nature of my job title, the management at my particular store would abuse their power and schedule me for jobs I was not prepared nor trained for. I will admit I learned a lot working at Lowe's, primarily about home improvement- but it stopped there. I planned on working my hardest to rise to the top and make a career out of Lowe's, but even my store would tell me that this was something I should never do... which struck me hard. It wasn't due to the customers, it wasn't due to the facility- it was due to the management. Never have I seen managers so out of touch with not only the customers but the employees as well! It is a shame, Lowe's could be a fun place to work but the bureaucracy and the management are the sole reason I left."
good,Good team to work with and you can learn and advance within the company.  Benefits are great for individual or family.  Working hours can be difficult for an individual with a family/children.
good,"insurance after 90 days, strict sick day policy and good supervisors nice atmosphere a lot of physical work not to bad of a job go for it you will like it"
good,"Fast paced and interactive with customers, I was allowed to Educate customers and help them with their home improvement Questions."
good,"Calls could be high or low. I learned empathy over the phone. The management was extremely poor, micro-management and the managers don't even know all the answers to your questions. The job is fairly easy though."
good,"Poor upper store management, bad scheduling.  Favorites get better schedules.  Very few associates on the clock, bouncing from one department to another, department managers are run ragged.  "
good,"In my almost 16 years at Lowes, I went through many changes.  Some of the changes were to streamline the business structure to better suit the needs of the customer.  However some of the changes took the business in the improper direction from an employee point of view.  There were many perks and benefits that were once afforded to employees that were taken away.  In many ways I learned important life skills that will serve me well in my next career as well as in my personal life."
good,"Perhaps a good place to start for someone just starting out, but not long term. The Lowe's business model is based on turnover, anyway. "
good,Lowe's overall is a good company but the location at Ogden Utah has very poor management and let popularity instead of work ethic govern the daily work place.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for for a first job unless you move up to management.  Managers are paid pretty well but regular floor associates do not make much.  The schedule is a fixed four week schedule but the times and days you work during the week change from week to week.  Can not work full time here and go to school at the same time.
good,meh aint bad management acted like they didnt know what to do. it would typically take about evry 2 weeks to see your schedule. and management always seem to undermine everyone. also talk about kissing the specialists butts to much.
good,"It was fun while we were staffed but then people moved on and they didn't fill their positions but kept demanding more from us. Managers don't talk to you much except for what you might have done wrong and won't help as they are also stretched thin. Trying to do your list of things when another manager might stop you to do something completely different."
good,A typical day at work as a cashier is to log in and get to the register and start ringing up people.  You are trained on the register. There are too many managers and therefore too many bosses.
good,"If the store manager would step down, I would be glad to come back to Lowe's. I was hired for the spring season. Met some great employees and made lasting friendships. Some were outright rude. Some followed the store manager around to be in his graces. Too many ethic violations to name but the number one problem for this store is the inappropriate relationships between employees-employees or management-employees. "
good,A typical day may consist of wearing many different hats. Some days require covering multiple sales areas at one time by one sales associate. This leads to losing quality associates.
good,"Was once a great place to work, but after the restructure in 2017, everything went downhill. Took on more of a work load and not much of a pay increase, or help from senior managers"
good,"It's a good place to work, not a great place to stay. It used to be a great place to think about retiring from, but know things are decreasing fast with this company. Benefits for families are too high, the incentives are not as giving as they were 10 years ago. Micro management is not healthy for any level of worker, especially for sales people that don't get paid much any way."
good,"I worked here almost 8 yrs and was never promoted, I applied many times and was always passed up for a younger person with less experience because they could pay them less then myself an 8 yr employee."
good,"had some good expernances, was very nice helping shoppers have a great shopping experance, always provided customers  with the knowledge of all products sold in garden dept"
good,Come into work on time and do your job. Take breaks as required. Make sure you clock in and out if your not on the clock. Stay customer focused at all times.
good,"The sense of community in our retail division was strong up until two years ago. Management style shifted and focus was lost. There have been improvements in technology and communication in 2018. This is a great company to work for to learn the realities of sales, and to learn the knowledge that will help you advance your career."
good,They let the other driver sleep in his truck while I busted my butt to do all the work. Everyone knew about it but did nothing about it. I was ready to leave them anyways but that kid lied and told mangament I said a racist word.
good,"I saw many problems associated with Lowe's but when brought to the attention of management, I was told to ignore it.  However, when they chose to follow the rules there was partiality.  I always worked hard and tried to stay out of the ""click"" since I didn't feel as if it benefited the store or the company."
good,"Lowe‚Äôs has recently hired a new CEO who is cleaning house, and restructuring the company. Over the last 3 years, I‚Äôve seen a lot positions dismissed. As well as many positions restructured. Frankly I don‚Äôt feel Lowe‚Äôs is a secure position anymore, and would like to tackle new challenges, with a stable company and friendly atmosphere, where employees and management are treated fairly, and with respect."
good,this is a good company to work but at will company and fire for no reason without cause. men are scared to have women take there jobs by working harder and faster.
good,"I loved working for Lowes. It was a seasonal job when i was there and i would not mind going back to work for the company. Great pay, wish i could have got the benefits but overall great job."
good,"Wasn‚Äôt the greatest company but wasn‚Äôt the worse either. Hours as an ASM iS very long, when you actually break down the salary to the hours you realize your better off as a Department Manager. I met some very helpful managers while there. Lowe‚Äôs  have some very hardworking and helpful managers. Others, not so much. It is be a very fast paced and competitive environment, you‚Äôre competing with other stores"
good,"Working here can be a hassle at times when dealing with rude customers, but it's not too bad. Just gotta adjust and shake it off. Provide great benefits"
good,"Lowe's was my first retail job to work at. At first many things were confusing to me, because we had to apply the discounts/sale prices ourselves. Also many times the bar codes would not scan so you would have to find the items item number either by looking it up or having to call the department which the item was found in. All this while being a cashier & having a long line was just very annoying. Other than that once you get the hang of things at any job it becomes easier for you.  My coworkers were very friendly and helped me a lot until I got the hang of things."
good,"Usually busy, but very customer-friendly home improvement warehouse.  Care very much for employees, and have a friendly work environment.  Above-average management team."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at lowes. Great, driven,ambitious people. I learned how to advance my power-equipment talents that'll last a lifetime. The hardest part of the job was the management! They are very unprofessional and not strong leaders. Which makes the team lack."
good,"You may work in one department of the store, but in actuality you work in your department and a little bit in every other department. which would make you somewhat well-rounded with the store. It doesn't matter if you know a lot or a little about home improvement, you will end up learning new everyday."
good,"Generally like the work. Mostly customer service, stocking and merchandising. I had a lengthy retail career prior to this job, so at management meeting as a department manager, i spoke up about issues and questions brought up by upper management. Apparently, the consensus was to keep quiet. So, I was like by department managers, but challenged by senior management. "
good,Its a decent place to work. Most employees are just treated like a number on the time clock. However working there is a wonderful learning experience and a great way to broaden your view of how the renovation world operates.
good,Working for Lowes used to be Great to me but the longer I have been there the less I feel valued. I feel as if the changes made are robotic and its been taking the fun out of all we do.
good,Cut throat management practices at local and market level. Over 100 associates left or terminated during past 10 months by new store store manager. Inappropiate behaviors between new store manager and Market level HR
good,"spent 9 years at lowe's  "
good,"The building was largely filled with low wage workers and seasonal employees who knew that they weren't staying there long because the company doesn't pay very well. But, helping customers was actually pretty fun."
good,Clique atmosphere. The jobs are straight forward. Most of the customers are ok. The only problem I have is the management. They are untrained or unwilling to help with anything.
good,My store specifically was very busy and the pressure was consistent to make productive sales and receive exceptional reviews online from customers. This strain for excellence caused management to be tough on its employees without proper knowledge of what our individual jobs consisted of. But the pay is slightly above average.
good,I worked at 3 Lowe's stores in 3 different states. Management is different for each location. Employees are mostly nice and easy to get along with. Can be stressful at times very busy with a variety of things going on every day.
good,"Generally positive work experience. Open to input from everyone and very responsive to that input. Compensation not great, but working to improve and be competitive in the market."
good,You get paid well but at what cost. Micro management is awful and they will built you up to tear you down. Makes you feel like nothing you do is ever good enough.
good,Newburgh store is really understaffed. Management is almost never on the floor and different managers will tell you to do different things which is frustrating. If you‚Äôre a hard worker you will be picking up the slack for others who don‚Äôt do their job.
good,"The store is in a good location with a lot of foot traffic , some days were easy while some days were hard , Its retail business that's fast paced and can stressful with a lack of poor staff ,  or when there's no communication for the day , managers tend to lack a lot , while very few actually are hard working but most just ride there associates and harshly criticize to get the job done. this job is not for everyone"
good,Lowe's works like the government or political campaign.  They sell employee engagement and pro-employee motto but actually don't care about employees.  Just their bottom line.  High turnover except for employee that get weekends off and work off sales floor.  Loved my job and the people but the company sucked.
good,"Lowe's is ok if you do not have any time commitments you want outside of work. It's a hit or a miss if you want time off for a class or anything, depending on how good your manager feels and how much corporate feels like enforcing their awful matrix because ""it's fair"". I would really like them to get rid of that and try to accommodate everyone's schedules at the store level which I've seen work when managers do it but then corporate will tell them they are not allowed. "
good,"Working at Lowe's, its a 50/50 ordeal. Certain managers are great, there is one, however, has no regard of personal lives. And with a Assistant manager like that, who will alter schedules without asking if a employee has a event, whether family or other, causes problems. On top of that, having favorites and singling out certain workers cause of certain things they don't like? That is a recipe for serious implications later down the road. Other Managers are more considerate for people's lives, but some aren't as good as others. My tip: you get a job at Lowe's, its a 50/50, if its the bad 50, start looking for a better job with more reasonable hours, pay, and lets not forget managers."
good,"I learned how do help customers and keep them satisfied. Hardest part of the job is getting help to pull a product that weighs over 75 pounds, but it is nice when employees come to gather to help each other out."
good,"For the most part the management teams for the 2 stores I have worked at have been decent, with the occasional bad apple that turns up because of store transfers.  The worst part of the job is the lack of work/life balance.  They don't want you to have a live outside of the company.  If your lucky enough to get one of the few permanent full time positions then requesting time off becomes impossible.  There is also zero hope of having ANY kind of regular schedual.  All full time staff need to be availve the 120 hours a week the store is operating and work all shifts in one week period."
good,"Lowes use to be a great place to work for, everything is about making a dollar to them now. They want you to be efficient but they do not give you the proper tools to do so. Big example is staffing, they give you the least amount of staffing possible and they expect you to assist customers in 2 or 3 different departments with just one employee. I feel that hurts customer service a lot."
good,"Working with the public directly is definitely a good life lesson.  People are so different in so many ways and being able to learn and adapt to peoples individual needs is a pleasure as well as a curse."
good,Lowe's is not for everyone.  You have to put up with a lot of nonsense. Quite a bit of turnover. A good mixture of age groups. You must have open availability.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for the benefits that they offer are very good. Good work environment for the most part. Hardest part is having to deal with difficult customers throughout the day .
good,"Disappointed with the equipment, belts break, poor lighting in trucks. Loose safety measures. When equipment down, employees are penalized. Pay is higher than other companies."
good,"While I was at Lowe's we had a very difficult time. We lost an employee and a store manager, they both died. Did not have a new manager when I left. They were trying to hire new people and they were transferring people. I felt like they forgot why they were there, to help the customer."
good,"Every day was very fast paced and tiring. At first it was getting used to spending 10 hours on your feet on top of lifting heavy product consistently. Coworkers were always willing to assist and they made to work place better and over time became a second family. The hardest part of the job was just the fact that it was physically exhausting and over time just wore your body down, especially if you didn't follow proper procedure for lifting, and or operating machinery.  A job where you could very easily get hurt if you weren't paying attention and it was imperative that you did. They did show employee appreciation with big events, but I felt as if they should have recognized more of the small things to make us feel like we mattered. But all in all it was not a bad job, they had good benefits and raises approximately every six months."
good,Management is only worried about the dollars. Nothing else. They let stress levels get high and morale get low and then just get rid of people to try and fix it instead of helping to fix the morale and stress issues.
good,"Lowes could be a fun fast paced environment. Management is sometimes lacking. Benefits are decent. Overall good place to work."
good,Ok place to work if on a set schedule and full time. Pay could be much more competitive. People not on a set schedule have a poor work life balance. Good for the experience.
good,I would say that Lowe‚Äôs is a great starter job unless you are looking for a management opportunity. I started at Lowe‚Äôs after high school and stayed there until I finished college.
good,Though the corporation has a set of viable programs this particular store did not follow them. Though corporate plans were put into place this particular stores manager felt to operate in his own agenda thus causing much confusion and discord within the management team which in turn caused questionable follow up.
good,"Started off as a seasonal employee in outside lawn and garden with about a $10.80 pay. Started off mostly as a loader helping customers load their cars. Eventually moved towards a closer role where I helped close the department. Keep busy anyway you can and management will notice. Phone it in and they will eventually talk to you. After the summer several employees seasonal and part-time were let go, and some left for school. They raised my pay to $11.90 and offered my a part-time position. Took it with the intention of soon getting another job. Overall the people were nice, management is about as honest with you as you are with them, HR is a bit phony and noncommital."
good,Lowes is a physically and mentally demanding job. They constantly move product which makes good customer service and shopping in a huge warehouse nearly impossible.  Atmosphere is extremely loud with constant loud overhead intercom. Work atmosphere is akin to high school socially.  Very cliquish. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the garden center. Being outdoors with customers who were generally in a good mood.  Lowes does not protect their employees from any form of customer harassment or physical altercations with customers.  Customers at this store can be hostile and difficult to handle especially with little or no support from management. Lowes constantly dangles the carrot of free money bonuses which it rarely gives out.
good,Micromanagement. One manager tells you one thing and the other another. No one seems to be on the same page at the moment. Store Manager is becoming cocky and going on power trips. It is time for a new one.
good,"typical retail environment, expect more for less.  very demanding credit card goals.  most low level managers are very young and have little leadership skills."
good,Retail hours and like all retail jobs the compensation does not meet your financial needs. There is a lot of heavy lifting and ladder n the Seasonal department along with constant shelf resets. (Seasonal Department)
good,You can definitely grow at Lowes if you are willing to sacrifice your work/life balance. Your work experience will vary depending on your position. It definitely keeps the bills paid.
good,Management did not promote the best people for new positions. Favoritism is a HUGE downfall at several locations. No one is being held accountable for mistakes so associates do whatever they want. Hardest part of the job was busting your hump everyday and not getting recognized until you finally take an easy day. BUT those associates that skate under the radar everyday are allowed to.
good,Good health insurance. terrible rotating schedule. Undue stress from management. REQUIRED HEAVY UNASSISTED LIFTING. Constantly changing the in store management structure
good,"This used to be an excellent company to work for with great benefits, a laid back atmosphere and an appreciation for dedication and hard work. Unfortunately, things have changed and it has started feeling like a clique and where you rank in that setting, rather than your job performance or abilities, determines how likely you are to advance in your current role."
good,Lowes use to be a fun place to work until they decide to restructure the company. Now they think they can get the same productive they did when they employed 120 employees out of 80 employees and its not fair to the employees or the customers. So basically their cutting down on experience to hired employees with less experience and pay them less.
good,the morale at lowes is very low. hours are all over the place which makes it hard to keep employees. so the employees that do stay usally are covering multiple departments.
good,Managers were hard to find. Customers were difficult sometimes. Always something to so. Training is tedious. Hours in front of computer. Fork lift training is fun.
good,"A typical day at work begins with the clock in, then immediately to your post. It is usually cut and dry, you have your responsibilities so there isn't much guess work involved. Do your job, you get an hour for lunch as well as two fifteen minute breaks. I appreciated management to a point, they were understanding when I had to go on leave to have my daughter, however it was not paid leave so I was out a lot of income to take care of myself and my newborn. Workplace culture was quite amicable, with plenty of support when you needed it, everyone really had each other's back. Though you do have the occasional individual who always seemed to make the job into a social call. The hardest part of the job has to be the variability of the work hours. Since my shifts changed daily, it was difficult to balance my work life, personal, and prenatal doctors visits. Considering the cost of living, I personally do not think the pay was enough. Not only that, but i knew individuals who had been employed there for upwards of six-ten years that had not been advanced in their field at all. When it came to hiring a new manager for a department, there were qualified individuals who deserved the position, but they chose to use external individuals."
good,"Poor supervisors and lack of leadership and no transparency, no motivation  ,very reserved  when it comes to properly engaging associates demandis...."
good,Rough way to make a living. VERY stressful. Someone from another dept always has something for you to do. Customers line up to talk with you and there is no add'l help. Staffing is way too thin. So many things require a manager override and managers are few.
good,It was great working there but a lot of micro managing and very bad working with upper management and they are just the worse . Had to see upper management fraternize with certain employees .
good,Decent..the problem is local.management.  overall top.management is ok.  Rules change store to store with local management.  The hierarchy of things only apply to the upper management in the store.
good,"doing the same things all day. A lot of people you work with don't really care about what's going on. A lot of heavy lifting. Concrete and lumber. They don't pay you enough for the strain it puts on your back in my opinion. Only males ever seemed to have to do that kind of thing, never asked females to do anything like that. Equality right? "
good,"In support roles, there is coverage for all shifts, so there isn't the expectation of being available 24/7.  There is a lot of turnover in the environment."
good,"Inconsistent schedules, only one weekend off . You may open, you may close or anything in between, including the dreaded ""Clopen"" (close at 10 or 11pm then open at 5 or 6am the next morning!). They push the boundaries of the employment codes and they know it. The employee discount sucks - 10%, the same as a the Military Discount they offer. BUT the benefit opportunities are great."
good,"Training is poor, software confusing, and policies poorly implemented.  Empowered, interesting environment where life skills are available in every conversation with customers"
good,Working at Lowe's was nonstop. It felt like you ran constantly and still couldn't get everything done. The store was extremely busy so there wasn't any downtime. Communication was not the best due to lack of training and employee turnover.
good,"Hours caused a lot of problems with full time and part time alike, many of the managers are great people but because there are so many people trying to manage the same thing everyone's opinions tend to bring everything to a stand still because nobody can agree with what should be done and how to do it."
good,Due to restructuring of management being content with your job was near impossible. No job security.  Unable to keep good quality help.  Very fast paced which was great in making the day go by.
good,Lowe's is a great environment if you're not in a position of authority. If you're in a position of authority then it can become stressful. Not flexible
good,"I made a lot of friends working for this company, but I want to make money not friends. When I first started out even though I was part-time, I was still working at least 30-40 hour and now they have me on for 1 day a week."
good,Ok place to work if you can handle the stress. Management varies widely from location to location. Constantly evolving so be ready to embrace changes every day.
good,"Maternity leave is very less"
good,receiving a truck is a little difficult everything is loaded from floor up and everything is unloaded by hand with the exception of pallets that are wrapped. and everything has to be unloaded before the night stockers get in.
good,"I loved working at Lowes but, I worked hard and didn‚Äôt get the full time position. I worked as a seasonal employee. This was a great and fun environment to work in."
good,Lowes is a great place to work to learn more about the home improvement business. It also offers discounts to its employees. However there is little more for growth.
good,Some of the best people that I have worked with are my fellow associates and specialists at Lowe‚Äôs. Unfortunately this does seldom carry through to management as there is a great deal of protecting and promoting one‚Äôs self in management. This poor culture and lack of support for subordinates greatly undermines the company‚Äôs stated purposes and causes lower than normal morale as well as inflating stress and anxiety.
good,working at lowes is like working for management that dont know what they want. One manager tells you to fix one thing and another tells you to undo it.
good,"Being a telephone ""operator"" is just not for me. If you like being on the phone, then this job is for you. You are constantly on the phone trying to help customers with their repair issues. You have structured breaks. You also have the ability to do community service (which I liked)."
good,"Not enough team building, and people who worked hard did not get nearly enough praise. Customer service is extremely stressful and management expects you to do their job on top of doing the job you're already doing."
good,There are awesome and fun workers at Lowe's which make you enjoy your job there but the job security is low. The managers are kind of strict to work with.
good,"Between constant changes and not being fully informed if at all during these changes change is something Lowe's apparently does not know how to properly implement, being given so much work that you can't possibly finish it all within the given time frame because management keeps adding more to your list of things to do and doesn't help with any of it at all. Lowe's was not a good place to work at when there were changes happening."
good,"I used to really love my job. My only issue is the lack of help. There is zero accountability for those that are not team players. When there is more than one person scheduled in a department, there us often no overlap of hours."
good,Lowe's is a competitive company but if you really want a job with great benefits then Lowe's is the place to go. i've learned a lot at Lowe's and i thank them for teaching with alot
good,"In general, Lowe's is a fair place to work. Starting out they offer a competitive enough wage to entice people to begin. The trouble begins when you seek advancement or if you just don't get along with someone in your department. The struggle many have with Lowe's is that it is basically like returning to high school. The rumor mill is so very present here that if I tell a juicy secret to a person on one end of the store it likely will spread to the entire rest of the store before I could walk the length of it via the interdepartmental telephone system. There are a lot of tasks you can take on and learn within a Lowe's that are beneficial to you like the individual tasks within each department, but Lowe's does not give you any real reason to try and learn those tasks by means of raises or promotions. You are stuck where you start unless there is an open position you happen to acquire. This job does not give raises based on merit. They may tell you otherwise but it is simply not true. Unless experiencing a job title change you will only receive an annual raise. Usually pennies."
good,"Constant surveillance of store to ensure smooth running of store and client satisfaction. Majority of people were fun and hard working, but most management were not supportive to stand by you when you did the right thing for the customer.  Store manager was extremely chauvinistic (has since left). I enjoyed my people and helping all departments, other than my own, throughout the day."
good,"Typical company that is understaffed. Pay is low for seasonal workers so you rarely get any quality personnel and management realizes. Lowe's fails to realize that if they spent more $ to acquire better help that was dedicated and qualified, it would eventually result in better customer service resulting in people wanting to shop there more often."
good,"i liked my coworkers and the environment, and the customers became family-like too. management totally unorganized sometimes. took them over a year to get my appropriate rewards points"
good,I enjoyed my job at lowes and being a team with the coworkers I met. There is opportunity to learn different parts of the store. My only issue was with management and usually I get along well with people telling me what to do and getting it done in a timely manner.
good,"I would love to work for Lowe,s again.  The customers were great.  Working in Tools & Hardware I had the enjoyment of discussing something that was very easy for me."
good,hours sucked pay was median. my managers were awesome. moving schedule. and it didn't work well with a family life. would be good for a single person.
good,"I loved working for lowes until the did a reconstruction of the whole company. They laid off most of the asms and let go of 90% of department managers keeping only 5/6 and making them service managers. It was very stressful for everyone because asms were doing store manager jobs, service managers were doing asms jobs and associates were left trying to get threw the work days with no support from any managers, they were too busy to help employees let alone customers. Anytime you would ask for help they would snap at you or catch an attitude."
good,I was given a very large workload but not given adequate raises. I was also reprimanded if I had to work overtime to complete workload. I was promised a raise when my annual review was due and when it came due I was just given 0.35
good,Started out well with the company and eager to work with a new team in a Big Box environment. Daily duties and responsibilities were good and associates were a pleasure to work with.
good,Job was fast paced and management was not helpful. If you needed help with a customer they would take awhile to answer your call for help. If I asked for help it would be  minutes before I got an answer.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people."
good,"Lowes is a high paced environment, in which I enjoyed working. I did not like the lack of communication shown by upper management. Policies not followed on a consistent basis."
good,Lowes is an alright place to get your foot in the door to job expierence. You'll learn how to act and help customers with any question or concern that may happen as it will also help you with product knowledge.
good,"When they were expanding aggressively, there were all sorts of opportunities to be had. Now it seems like they restructure their store management every 2 years."
good,"At my store we had a lot of great people working there, it was very nice if you don't mind the manual labour. Their systems are in dire need of an update as it can be nearly impossible to use their computer system without someone showing you around, as it still uses a text only based operating system."
good,"I have been with this company for awhile now, and the work place enviroment although fast paced, is complimented by the fun and witty management that has been placed there, I think if you needed a job at a young age this is a good fit for you."
good,Its long hours but the over time makes up for the time lost with your loved ones. Management needs improvement a lot of them don't care about the workers. Just worried about the deliveries going out.
good,There is always something to do and your shift is always seemingly jammed packed with activities. The compensation is much better than soem other summer or part time job locations and that is very godd.
good,Management /hr won`t work with you. No one wants to there job. Or it`s not in there  job descriptions.Hr wouldn`t help for relocation. Employees when your not around stab you in back.
good,"Lowes is a ok company to work for, I enjoyed my time there. I would suggest they update their technology, they are light years behind other companies.  I would also update their Policy's and Procedures manual. What worked 10years ago is no longer the most proficient way to run a business."
good,"Lowes motto is Love where you work.  Although, there manager motto ought to be ""do as I say not as I do"" there are a lot of double standards for employees and managers. Other than that Lowes is Ok to work for"
good,"Your experience working at Lowes can vary depending on who your store manager is. Lowes does not do a very good job at hiring store managers. The two I have dealt with have poor people skills. Meaning, they do not know how to really talk to people when there is a problem. It is a good place to work to gain experience and learn new things about the department you work in."
good,My work experience with Lowe's Foods was thirteen years ago so much has changed since that time.  The store I worked at had a management staff that supported my full time school schedule.
good,Management could not get a grip with the schedule. Every weekend we where understaffed. Only place to check out was at self checkout.  Customers always angry because of long line. Managers could not get the schedule right to save their lives. Overall a good job love the people I worked with but poor management.
good,Hours are inconsistent and unpredictable starting out just as you'd expect with most retail jobs which makes work-life balance a challenge.  Senior associates have more control of their hours.  Good job for someone who needs part-time hours or 2nd job.  Pay is very competitive by retail standards.  Working with a large inventory of diverse products and customers in a fast paced environment is fun.
good,"Management is awesome at my store"
good,"average retail, you will have to be fexable in hours its never the same shift, you have to be a bubbly kiss a** to get promoted now matter your expieriance or work ethic."
good,"Management puts in conscious effort to create positive corporate culture. Under staffing, high turn-over, antiquated inventory software (DOS) and stringent safety requirements, make for impossible performance expectations."
good,Lowe‚Äôs has been falling apart. The restructuring we have been doing is not well thought out. It‚Äôs going down slowly and I‚Äôm not gonna be there to see how the company turns out. Always short staffed on busy days and too staffed on days not needed. It‚Äôs just poorly ran.
good,"Overall, I wouldn't have stayed with this company if it was entirely bad. They do offer benefits (medical, dental, etc. - that you pay for), decent pay for the field, and some other bonuses - like discounts at specific other places. This company saw me through a LOT of life events."
good,"I liked working at Lowes, but there wasn't room for advancement once the company made changes. The employees were nice and I made many friends there. The company as a whole was ok."
good,"The job is busy and non-stop,   It is a more of a task driven company than a customer focused one, it may be the market, because it preaches something different."
good,"Very poorly managed."
good,"There is a lot of nepotism, and if you want to move up in the company, you have to have a degree or too much experience for what they expect. They want too much for the positions and the pay they offer. They care more about how well you interview than if you are actually qualified for the job. Will give a job to a person with less experience if they are related to somebody. The company itself is great. Small town = small town problems. It is not the company itself, just the small town people that work there that are the problem. Meant for college students and retired people."
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, but management wasn't as professional as i would of expected. For the most part i enjoyed working at Lowe's. The atmosphere was great."
good,My thoughts on Lowe‚Äôs is it is a very welcoming job and it keeps u moving with out the day some days you might have the easy stuff but other days can be a rough one other then that this place is pretty good to work at
good,"A typical day consists of really having to rely on other members of your department on different shifts. The hardest part of the job was that very few individuals were doing their jobs, but the team was looked at as a whole, therefore there was no accountability for those not doing their job. The environment was fun however, lots of interaction with coworkers as well as customers. I did find that the workplace culture at my store was specifically homophobic. Most managers worked alongside their employees which was refreshing."
good,Is not hard work but not good on having coverage in departments which causes stress in the work place. Still a good job to have but management does not back up there employees if in a stressful situation. That is some of the mangers I had really good mangers that would help me and back me up to a customer if the customer was hostile. But the others would not help or back up there employees.
good,"The little time I worked there, I had problems with a certain head cashier. The head cashier would try to belittle me and pick with me and nothing was done about her. I was actually the one who got in trouble and instead of trying to handle the situation professionally, they let it go on. I learned to ignore them and leave it alone. It was a lot of favoritism going on in the line of work. But it was a good pay at the time."
good,"I Love that warehouse and have always wanted to work there, I used to love to just browse and look at what I wanted, the job was good but wages were slim."
good,"I don't like the managers who will not back policy because they believe it's good customer service or are too lazy to deal with a problem, and the ones who don't do anything."""
good,It's ok want to try something new. It has been good to me. good place to work. fast pace learning to take family in consideration. people are great to work with
good,Its face paced but since the shift is understaffed we are required to do more which in turn turnes the workplace more stressful. There have been a lot of bad management moves that are affecting the workers.
good,"Typical retail setting.  There is a certain amount of independence in performing your duties.  The scheduling is the weak point, if you live to work it is good.  The schedules are all over the place day to day and week to week."
good,I like lowes I just didn't like my store. managment was inconsisten and they don't pay you more or less for moving around the store to different positions
good,Live for Lowe's.  Don't have a personal life.  Managers don't want to help.  They expect you to do everything.    Not enough help.  Keep cutting hours to keep up with payroll.
good,"I worked for Lowe's just under 15 years. It is not always the easiest place to work, being understaffed most of the time takes a toll on the good solid employees. Management tried to help as much as possible, when they where free to do so.  My direct service manager however was amazing and I miss working with her greatly. You must be open minded and able to adapt to change quickly and efficiently. Lowe's is an ever changing environment and will consistently challenge you."
good,"This was a post-retirement part-time position for a few extra dollars.  "
good,"The store manager was so bad the company fired him shortly after I got a new job.  My direct supervisor was a good guy.  I enjoyed working in the tool department.  Yes, I would work there again."
good,"Customer service is uppermost. Department managers must be efficient in multitasking, training and delegating tasks. Dealing with requests from the store management team can be trying at times. Most enjoyable  part of job is recognition from customers"
good,"No script required at the Lowes Corporate Call Center.  Weekly meeting ocurred to enure employees were informed of any corporate changes, current promotions and trends."
good,they don't want to provide help when need it. expect drivers to work long hours when they need and then they send you home early next day.they expect employees to take vacations when convenient for them.
good,I have consistently was stressed on a daily basis. There wasn‚Äôt really a day that I came in to a relaxed day at work. Although work is not supposed to be easy this job put unneeded stress on my home life.
good,"Lots of organizational disfunction and very political. There is a fierce resistance to change that permeates most IT departments. Being a full time employee feels like being a contractor, generally no regard to how work gets done, just get it done check it off the list. Poor to mediocre performers can play the political game and thrive at Lowe's."
good,"At first I had a great team. 5 guys, we all got along, had great conversation, worked at a good pace and for the first time ever, I was excited to go to work everyday. But each member eventually moved on to better things and I was left with a team that just couldnt compete. Some were always on their phone and some kept leaving and would be gone for long periods of time. I had to hold everyone's hand and for $10/hr that just wasn't going to cut it. This job does ask for much all while giving very little in return. If you're lucky, you'll have a good team to help you out. Also, pray that management decides to put you with guys who are at least somewhere within your age range and that your forklift driver knows what he's doing. "
good,The store I worked at there was a manager who didn't know how to lead our team and constantly demoralized us as we worked. Other than him most of the other managers were extremely helpful and knew how to lead.
good,"my problem with Lowe's is the manger that makes the schedule, purposely lets the staff be short handed almost every other day and never hire enough people."
good,"I would wake up at 4 A.M. to go to a factory with 600+ employees to load trailers into trailers into walls. I learned how to manage mt time, work fast and efficiently, and also to multitask. Management did not manage just insulted all employees. The whole factory is stern on safety. Hardest part of the job was the hours. i hated doing the same thing for 12+ hours. I loved finishing my day and knowing that i made it through a tough day and weekend."
good,Some associates are great and helpful. Management changes a lot and things are not kept consistent. Not enough support from managers for certain departments and events.
good,"Management is the downfall of this company. The regular associates and individuals in non-management positions require occasional assistance from supervisors. However, management falls short of their duties when it comes to helping out the individuals who keep the store in operation, i.e. the regular associates."
good,it was a fun seasonal job for the few months I was there. the people were friendly and helpful. my supervisor worked well with me on my hours so i could take my son to and from school
good,"PROS:"
good,Just an  average place to work. There are mostly younger people that work there so under the age of 35. It‚Äôs a fast place to work so you‚Äôre never really bored.
good,"Lowes is overall a decent place to work. However, in recent days, staffing has become an issue which has caused problems with general morale. Most employees feel overworked and coverage in a given department is generally low. At the same time, management is constantly on top of their employees which creates a more stressful environment. However, there have been recent hiring events and there seems to be some attempts to remedy the situation. Time will tell."
good,"As far as retail companies go, Lowe's is in the middle of the pack, not necessarily good and not too bad. It is just a job to pay the bills. The dress code is fairly relaxed, so that is nice."
good,"ITs a pretty good place to work it does have benefits but doesnt give you sick leave, for advancement they pick who they want to not who deserves or is qualified for the position."
good,"always felt like you had to worry about having a job, customers are never wrong, not enough help, very minimum training for tasks that were required to complete job"
good,"Everyday was the same. The coworkers were kind and positive. Downside, you stay there for a long time. Very few people were able to progress after 6months. They would typically hire someone new before they would promote you."
good,If you want a family life dont work here. To get promoted you need to work all the time. Depending on the manager that may not be enough. Employees i worked with made it tolerable.
good,"Terrible employees, poor management, changes being made are horrible and bad for business, employees are out for themselves and not to better the company"
good,"It's good because you can learn a lot from the products and customers if you take your job seriously.,"
good,"This company will keep you working.  The general policy is that each associate is to help cover neighboring departments.  This will expose you to some amount of knowledge of many different aspects of home improvement.  The work can be fun, when interacting with the public, however, it is also a physical job at times.  Team spirit is always promoted and generally intact.  Overall, it is a place for a younger employee, as the pace and physical aspects of the job are very demanding."
good,"I loved working for Lowe‚Äôs in the almost two years that I was there. Coworkers were absolutely wonderful, and so were some of the managers. And I loved the departments I worked in. However, store management at this particular place expects you to be able to live on ten hours a week if you are part time. I was passed over for full time jobs multiple times, even though I was qualified for most of the positions. The store manager does not care about anything except cutting hours to get his bonus and lining his own pocket."
good,I really don't wish to give an opinion about my former company and I feel being REQUIRED to give one by your company is rather presumptive and invasive
good,"Understaffed for the amount of work that needs to be done.  Not really any chance for advancement.  Some folks do most of the work while others are hiding and checking out their phones.  Management does the best they can with what they have.  Hardest part of the job is the non stop lifting, Most enjoyable using the powered lift equipment."
good,not a hard job to perform day to day but improvement in day to day operations are nonexistent. People you work with are good folks who are trying to make a living.
good,"Lowes offers a lot more opportunity for advancement, IF, your store has openings and IF your managers like you more then other people. "
good,Needs a lot of management by the right person.  People work rights were always violated.  Other employees were given the job of some one that could finish it . I would have stayed only if the bad language would stop.  .
good,"Lowes is s good company to work for, the benefits are really good and the pay is above average until you get to management. The new management structure does not give a lot of room for growth and development and the pay for SSMs is not enough when compared to the job load"
good,"I like Lowe‚Äôs as an employee and I love the people I work with, the management doesn‚Äôt seem to be on the side of the employees and the pay is very little for the work and labor that we put in. Great environment and team members"
good,No communication between managers and employees.  Job description changes daily depending on who the manager is.  Complaints are never addressed.  Rotating shifts make it hard to plan anything on your off time.
good,"Management is hit or miss and the constantly shifting corporate structure does not guarantee that good people will stay in their positions.  The morale at my particular location was constantly poor and employees were kept in the dark regarding pending changes even when they impacted their earnings or roles within the company.  Overall not a bad place to work if you are just looking for a paycheck, but certainly not a place for people who care about what they do - the environment will prove too stressful for such employees."
good,The hours were whenever they needed you. They pull you from one department to another when they need help so your feel like your literally working the entire store!
good,"Inorder to be a good leader you have to be a good follower but Mo at importantly a good listener. This is what they lack. Overall the pay is decent, and they start off well. The raid isn‚Äôt that much though"
good,"All employees treated each other for the most part like family. "
good,Lowes is perfect for the teen or college student that is looking to start working.  Plus you get to drive a fork lift.  The stock options are nice too.
good,1. Long hours and stressful situations.
good,"Good job, good people plenty of work The upper management cares about looking good for corporate office not the people that do the job. Supervisors are good for the most part."
good,"Not too many people to chat with or make friends with, but my workload was fun and kept me busy.  Manager who is very understanding and easy going, allowed me to work from home 2 days a week and whenever need be. No automatic paid holidays, but you are allowed to work on a holiday and get paid."
good,"Unload a truck scan product into inventory"
good,I was a supervisor that never had enough help.  It was stressful during the holidays with no help.  Managers never helped enough and always went to talk or hide some where.  One even had some my cashiers crying on the store floor.  They never did anything to him. I had enough.
good,I'm currently employed part-time for a position as a Truck Unloader. It's a great job when productivity is flowing smooth. But the store im located in has terrible management for the receiving department. HR manage hires terible co-wokers who are lazy and text non-stop. Many more issues for white marsh lowes I noticed from working there for a year and half.
good,retail work at its finest. non stop always moving. helping customers on a daily basic. great meeting people thru all walks of life. lack of advancement.
good,"I spent almost 2 years at the same location and received exactly what I expected from a retail chain, big box store, focused (barely) on customer service. It was a job, but very unfriendly to personal life or personal advancement/ improvement."
good,Great place to work with great benefits. I wish management was more compassionate and more avaliable to associates needs. but overall liked this job..
good,They have their pros and cons. Pretty stable schedules. Store Managers dishonest. They give out assignments with deadlines and then make them impossible to complete them!
good,"I worked as a cashier at Lowes. I learned different skills such as being a cashier, learned how to take care of tax exempt (commercial customers). As well as varieties of responsibilities, stocking shelves throughout the store, assisting customers and so on."
good,"While I have nothing to base Lowe's off (since this is my first ever job), I've been told that the way they do things is different from any other employer."
good,"If your a hard working and outgoing honest person wo knows how to leave your home problems at home. This retail business is a blast. Not every customer knows what they need or where to find it. I in particular have a comfort level in any department I walk through or into and could answer any problem and get them the solution to any issue they had. I would get dozens of customer satisfaction letters. The store wants 5 star associates, its so easy just help the customer period. And when its quiet fill the shelves with merchandise so more can be sold. "
good,"I have nothing to say. The customers complained about everything ,for no reason. One customer told our department manager that I was like a dog.,and I got reprimanded."
good,"After the corporate restructure, there was a big change in the moral with everyone at Lowes. It has now become a very stressful and inconsistent workplace."
good,for a temp job it was alright. The management was not very friendly and expectations were never very defined. fun job but definitely underpaid for the work.
good,When I first started working at lowes it took care of their employees and as time went on the less they cared for you and more about the bottom line which became more important than anything else.  Bottom line got smaller per store once employees were not important you worked or got replaced by someone else.
good,You would serve customers at the checkout and direct people to products. The best part of the job was the flexible hours that you could work and the worst part was the management.
good,Great team environment. Management still struggles with the treatment and following procedures. Working with a strong team on sales floor makes the job more enjoyable.
good,Depending on the area you get put in will determine how your work life is. From the start you will notice a lot of team members getting favoritism. Then some areas have harder time meeting goals then others.
good,"Depending on what store you worked for. My first store was a fantastic place to work for. Second store was just unorganized, demeaning, and atrosious."
good,"initially i was hired as a temp worker then was hired as a full time employee,worked with a group of good people management thinks you should try to get people to buy items that you know they dont want ,extra warranty,etc..."
good,"Loading contractors and customers. Learned different types of wood products and garden plants. Management was alright, it changed a lot over time. Hardest part was having rude customers that came in with an attitude. Easiest part was having fun employees to work with. They come and go, some nice, some mean."
good,"Learned forklift operator, I like the people I work with, I‚Äôm running around one end to the other, the hardest part about my job is help people that need help and just not enough staffing there to help out when needed"
good,Managment was awful. Pay was above average. Customers are usually in a bad mood. HR was never there when you needed him. Poor structure. The company just is not the same.
good,Good place to go although can be competitive.. Have to find your flow within what they require for all employees.. I enjoyed several job position Ive held there and almost attempted to move up for Performance Instructor position after former coach entrusted me to train new hires/temps
good,"The upper management did more delegating than assisting when it came to working, also they will believe a customer before they believe an employee in a complaint filed. upper management was very unhelpful the only time they would talk to you is if you were under review or they found a complaint was filed and they wouldn't tell you when it happened or what to work on. hardest part of working there was being constantly monitored and watched. The people that work with you can be good or bad it goes both ways depends on the person."
good,"Lowe's can be a great place to work, but it all depends on what the management is like.  What you had to do constantly changed on a day to day basis, but there were regular things that had to be completed on a weekly basis.  The catch was to balance the two."
good,Great place to work if your retired not a career move for anyone. Management was a rotating door and the large majority of them did not treat the people fairly. The company as a whole has been finding ways to cut jobs and lower wages since I got hire.
good,it was an okay job nothing more or less hours wasn't that great especially for my position only good hours for the summer pay wasn't enough they're supposed to pay based on experience
good,"Difficult job, lots of ppl to please. Rules change often management is not fair and consist with all. Managers  often use overhead paging system to manage folks"
good,overworked and fast paced work environment. lack in communication and coverage for breaks and lunches. never got out of work at the time I was supposed to. the hardest part of the job was garden center when it was still cold out.
good,Come in to be ready to sweat a lot since I work in the back unloading the truck trailer full of items. Job can be a little stressful since you are dealing with heavy items and fragile items as well not just regular boxes.
good,You can bust your behind and the people who do not even do half of the work you do get praised. Everyone has poor attitudes. Everyone is rude. I do three times my job and I don't get paid enough for what I do and deal with. Very disorganized.
good,I am not interested in writing a review of my typical work day.  I have learned how to operate an order picker and a narrow aisle fork truck.  I like driving and being on the road.
good,Easy paced atmosphere. Hires mainly young people with little availability. Some area for advancement. Good Benefits. Job security is pretty good . Over all decent place to work.
good,"My store has poor management, inconsistent scheduling, preference in scheduling and hour depending on how they feel about you.  Hardest part of the job is no set schedule or hours.  Work culture is preferential. The most enjoyable part of the job are some co-workers. A typical day at work is busy.  I learned customer service, patience and team work."
good,"Fast paced, small town with no workforce.  Moved from Houston to Kerrville.  Very little job opportunities for someone not retired.  Need to get back into a company where I can use my experience and education."
good,"Work a long 10hrs a day getting product to the stores we service in a timely fashion."
good,"It's a smaller store so a lot of time was spent sweeping and trying to constructively occupy time with very little work to do. Co-workers seemed more lax about productivity. Managers offered very little training and had a monopoly on expertise. There would be between one and three on duty, so all real questions from customers had to be directed towards them. This meant customers having to wait while managers were tracked down for answers or keys or forklifts. Only one manager attempted to give valuable information about products to employees so that we could provide better service. It was a relatively easy job if you didn't care about learning anything or actually being useful to customers. Very stressful when you tried harder than others."
good,"I learned a lot but always knew no security........I was constantly told "" we will be up-front and honest with you"" I always expected that they knew for a year I was training my replacement."
good,Moral is extremely low and the associates are clearly not valued at all. Compensation is decent but we are all so overworked that it does not feel worth it in the end.
good,"As a product service associate, I was responsible in making sure all the planogram were up to date.  I was also responsible for building and setting up the new displays for the products.  Once the new products were out, my responsibility was to a make sure the stock was available to the customers on the shelf at all times."
good,Lowes is a good place to work if you are a people person and you don't need supervision to much. The associates are friendly and very helpful to the new comers.
good,"Overall, Lowe's provides a positive and consistent work experience. While the store demands a great deal of physicality and multi-tasking skills, it is generally rewarding. Particularly in my current location, the team is supportive and understanding. I am frequently acknowledged for my contributions and effort."
good,"overheard supervisors talking about people they interviewed very unprofessional if you ask me. for the most part you come in clock in and sit down and wait for angry customers to call you, about problems they've experienced in the lowes stores which always seems to upset customers. the people there think we're still in highschool not the worst place to work but dont get sunken to the bs"
good,"It was constantly busy at lowes from the time if opened till we closed. I would work a 14 day run with only 2 days off from working 14 days straight, it was very tiring. I learned many things not just from work but from the customers. Management at my store was all about the men! women no matter how well or how hard you worked didn't get the advancement men got them all the time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the sexism."
good,"The Asst. Managers hid most of the time so hard to gets help or answers to questions for staff or customers . Associates were working more than their department, sometimes up to 4 or 5 departments trying to cover each left no time to complete tasks that were "" vital "" in the ASMs eyes. Restructuring of management made things even harder, less DMs also means less coverage."
good,Over time the company have took certain directions that I do not feel is great for the company. There has become little too no advancement in this company. I think that it all depends on the direction the person is looking too take.
good,Lowes likes to get rid of the people that work and keep the people that don't. They also don't really care for the employees and there family's to much between hours and shift changes and also the way they treat you. And have a restructure to get rid of there employees that have been there the longest we lost 19 postions just in our store alone. Also try to cover it up to say its just 1 percent of the people that work at lowes that will lose there job. So the investors don't pull there money out like the last restructures.
good,Salary management is very stressful as cuts in coverage require managers to work open to close and days off are never the same.  Good people and secure job but zero work life balance
good,I enjoyed my time with Lowes but there was a lot of changes and I didn't feel that they treated their employees fairly. With my store if you wasn't in the management click they were set out to make things harder for you. Coworkers were ok there was the typical high school feel drama in most areas. The work is hard and you are on your feet constantly. Overall I stayed due to the pay but the company overall doesn't care about their employees at least in my store. Each one is different.
good,"Great place to work, however work hours are never consistent... Especially for new employees... Employees with more seniority always seem to get the most hours...."
good,"good job, enjoyed working everyday. there was no where to grow in company so had to move on to a better job.great place to work amazing people.hours were great"
good,Assisting customers with purchases and returns. Answering customer service calls and routing appropriately. Promoting loyalty programs and credit services to customers.
good,A typical day is fast paced and most of the management are great to work with.  H.R manager needs to be changed. There can be a lot of heavy lifting but several great people to work with
good,"Employees work hard, but the management is too strict for our position. Co-workers cause issues with others and no management steps in to put a stop to it. Management stresses training videos but will yell at you when you get a chance to get it done that you are needed to work."
good,"I loved working at lowes ,but they didnt always treat you fairly,I feel that they did'nt appreciate how hard i worked or how much i cared about getting things done ,they have there picks  when it comes to employees,"
good,"Maintained visually appealing and effective displays for the entire store."
good,blah blah blah blah bllaaaa blah blah blah blaaaaaahh bllah blah bllllllaaaaah blah blah I really don't want to write the review about it but it is making me do it so yeah
good,You meet all types of people from all walks of life. From all corners of the world . Some nice and not so nice . But at the of the day it was very rewarding when you knew made someone happy when help fine what they needed.
good,"Start the day with having to do someone else's job just so I could do mine. Certain employees could violate rules and get away with it but most could not. Some of the management, store manager, think they are a god and can do as they please. The hardest part was dealing with the ones who were lazy and got away with not doing their job and me having to do it for them because management didnt want to deal with them. Most enjoyable was working with some of the people that did do their job."
good,a great and friendly place to work. depending on the season your work load will change.i work at the service desk which is a lot of work more than normal cashiers but it doable. my only complaint is that i make just as much as a normal cashier but do twelve times the work.
good,"Busy, stressful, helping customers in a timely manner, learn different departments, how to special order items, cutting blinds, cutting keys, cutting carpet, cutting shelving etc."
good,"The pay is not bad for retail, but you work so many different hours that it is hard to have a personal life. It has good benefits for full time and some for part time."
good,Great people but held back due to company policies (requiring a manager to open back gate?) and the fact they got rid of department manager positions.
good,"There was lack of communication on the leadership part, which made it a very difficult place to work. The management were very mean-spirited and and did not show much kindness to their employees."
good,"After close to 1500 IT professionals laid off, it is an untrusting situation right now. The trust can not be won back. and most people are looking at other options."
good,"Lowes can be a great, relaxed and relatively easy place to work but it all depends on management. I loved it until management changed and became incompetent, messing up my schedule and making up stricter rules for no reason at all."
good,"the job as a manager was to train new hires about customer service, to know the products in the department and to know were the product is located. I have learned much from asking customers and thru learning center about different products.The management team at a local level is very good. We have become friends and co-workers after years of working as a team. Corporate level seems to be not as personal and only seems to be interested in the bottom line.The workplace culture in good at the store level.The hardest part of the job at lowe's is working the mixed hours and mixed days off. The best part of the job is helping customers with their project and to get them what they need to completewhat they are doing."
good,Lowes is great with giving me flexible hours to work around my other job.  I am able to switch hours with reasonable advance notice and that is a huge bonus.
good,"A typical day of work consists of working transaction reports, conducting internal and external investigations, monitoring and ensuring safety protocols, and driving an engaged safety culture throughout the store."
good,The best thing about working here was always working with people and getting to meet and help customers each and every day. The people that you work with are more than just co workers.
good,"Excellent training was provided on the floor, and in the outside lawn and gardening area. Training was provided and I learned how to operate a forklift."
good,"Although the work itself is as expected and can be rewarding at times, upper management is more concerned with overall hours than providing a healthy productive environment. The turnover has been disappointing in the years that the store has been open with many of the best and most dedicated workers moving on. I fully understand the adage that ""everyone can be replaced"" but that should not be the daily attitude of the management staff. It creates a very negative environment."
good,"Long hours and stressful environment in Delivery Department. Typical day started anywhere from 6-11AM depending on shift and finishing when done with that days' deliveries. Can be anywhere from 8-12 hour shifts. Management could research options before answering questions by employees with non committal answers. Rather than offering options for non existing advancement opportunities, and be open to suggestions."
good,"The typical work day is cool and laid back sometimes. Majority of the time, we lack associates so the ones we do have in certain departments are placed somewhere else. The management is terrible, they do not know how to talk to you as a person. They talk to you as if you are beneath them instead of talking to you like a human being."
good,"I was let go after about a month and a half for not meeting their needs. But in reality the management did not want to work to make sure my training was done, nor would they give me the time to do so. Im sure other departments are better but this one is poorly managed."
good,I enjoy working retail I'm good with the customers I have had 20 years experience the hardest part of the job is Corporate America makes it very difficult for you to be able to give 100% customer service
good,"We started out as a great company.  Over the past few years, our CEO has adopted an attitude of only looking at the end of the month profits.  He has taken steps that will cause this company to fail in the long term.  At the moment it is still a decent place to work because of the benefits offered and the employee stock option.  Be aware thought that many things are changing and the company, I feel, is up for sale."
good,"management showed favoritism,very disorganized,unprofessional"
good,"like my manager, employees some ok, nothing hard bout job,"
good,I think it's working with the customers that make it most rewarding. Staff and management  were always nice.  Not allowed over 30 hrs a week though and pay isn't much
good,Hard job to work for a single mother and a small child in elementary. No holidays off and required overtime sometimes. Management not very supportive.
good,Store experience should carry more weight when applying to corporate positions. Multiple attempts to advance into a HQ position seemed to be penalized by time spent in store management.
good,Make sure when learning their computer program you take ample notes. It is very outdated and it is a lot of on the job training. Be sure to ask lots of questions.
good,The job was very competitive and I loved that part but Lowe's managers made it hard to work with customer's. Not being able to see a project to the finish or sometimes see the area of the project and design the space without mistakes very hard.
good,"Working at Lowes had its ups and downs.  Some weeks would be good, and then there would be other weeks that were tough.  All depending on the direction that the company, and market staff wanted to go.  Had to be able to balance a personal life and a work life, but that's retail management, and almost every place that you go that is retail that is the story.  Your day's off were based on a 4 week matrix, but the shift could vary depending on the coverage that was needed."
good,I love my old manager when I work there but they were very particular about certain workers and favoritism was a big factor in who advanced and who didnt.
good,I deal with customers and employees that fuss and curse you out for not wanting to follow policy or not wanting to do their jobs. I have learned a lot and gained tremendous experience in so many areas. The management could be a lot better if they believed in helping and working with their peers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with attitudes and keeping a smile on my face and not saying anything. I enjoy most of the people I work with and doing my job when I have the resources to do so.
good,"while I worked there i got to work in different departments, I got to learn something new about all the products we carried daily as well as new special order items. I got to learn different skills from different departments. It was nice knowing that if I had a client with a very detailed question there was someone in the building that knew the answer."
good,Working at Lowes was a good experience because I learned a lot of good work ethic and a lot of skills there. The employees and management were all lovely people to work with and I am glad I got to work there.
good,I was a Pro service department associate. I worked with people that were not hard working and would leave without telling anyone. Management did not work well with our department.
good,Could be a lot better but they don't care about your life outside of work unless you are about dead. They change your schedule and place you withuot telling you or have any regards about what you want they don't ask they just do it.
good,"This job was kind of all over the place. While it was busy most days, there are days when it is quite slow, but you are never out of things to do. There are plenty of tasks to catch up on in the store, but the lack of employees hired is always an issue at stores like this or at least of this size. The management isn't very attentive to worker needs, until it comes to something you did wrong, so learn to rely on other workers and yourself for most things. It's not a glamour job but you don't work here for that. You work here for the paycheck and it's a good chance to get in shape on the clock."
good,"Typical work day is blue vest  talking about someone for some reason, lots of gossip, and cliques here. Very disappointed working with a bunch of adults who want to talk about everyone."
good,"great co workers, fun enviroment"
good,"As a Java Developer, I completed my work on time to my team. I Typically learn a lot of things which I don't know earlier. My team was very good and knowledgeable."
good,assist customers pull orders unload and load the truck I learned quite a bit about carpentry work management was ok the hardest part of my job was taking orders from people that wasn't managers or customers
good,"Lowe's is an enjoyable place to work, providing you are a go getter, and is willing to train yourself. As for management, they do have their favorites and many are unapproachable."
good,It's an alright job for someone starting out trying to get a few bucks to do something better with themselves nothing to advance into unless you particular don't want to do anything else.
good,The facility is very nice and most of the employees are nice that I have met. After only 2 weeks of shadowing several workers I was thrown to the wolves made to fly by the seat of my pants without hardly a bit of formal training. It took forever to get all the necessary tools but by then it was too late. 4 10 hour days were not too bad but without quality guidance and support from management it makes the job too much of a challenge and if you don't catch on and keep up with the employees within a month then they will terminate your contract without even telling you. I had worked on Monday and that evening at home I got a call saying they terminated the contract with the company that hired me to work there. I say if you can make it work then it is a good job but you better be able to learn really fast on the fly or you are out.
good,You just go in and do your job. You make sure the customers have everything they need. The most enjoyable part was to just talk to the customers and make sure they were not ignored.
good,Its a retail job with a lot of bullsh*t and politics amongst the employees. Management is a joke. most employees are just looking for a paycheck and not caring about what they do.
good,I had schedules payroll and HR on a daily basis. Checked receiving paperwork. Checked off drivers going out and coming in for deliveries. A lot of 24hr shifts for District Staff inspections. A lot of restructure. In charge of accounts payable all audits.
good,they have done nothing lately but try and save money for the corporate big wigs.  There is not much for job security in an place like this.  The reason I am on indeed is because i currently work for Lowes and don't know when the next wave of cuts are coming.
good,Decent place to work.  Nice people.  Management willing to work with you.  You can request additional hours if needed.  You do have to keep on top of the schedule if you need hours and follow up on requesting additional hours
good,I enjoyed what I did but got tired of working with people who stood around and did nothing.  I work hard to do a good job and be the best at everything I do.  My managers never had any issues with my work.
good,"This sums up the place in its entirety. ""The hierarchy of management tends to only have leadership skills without have an actual leaders capacity for direction resulting in a lot of mismanagement of human resources and counterproductive back and forth of one manager over another in the convoluted chain of command that their flawed system supports."""
good,Lowe's has been good to me for the last few years but lately it has gone downhill they have made some changes and the work atmosphere isn't the best the people at Lowe's aren't happy.
good,Used to be a great place to work competitive pay due to corporate restructuring working at Lowes has become a challenge overall morale across the country is at a low
good,"I'll start by saying I love the job that I do and the company that I started working for in 2004.  But, I have so many doubts in the direction, or lack thereof, that it seems headed. Constant changes in direction leave one wondering if the company's leadership has a vision for the future and a strategy for reaching their goals.  We waste money and resources on some really questionable programs and overthink what should basic no-brainers in our line of business."
good,Fast paced and stressful. Co-workers very friendly and helpful. They are always ready to help. It is rewarding to be able to make customers love where they live.
good,"Working for Lowe's wasn't easy. At first the pay was decent, but working in a department by yourself and not having a spotter to assist you was hectic. Management was no where to found and pro service desk was too busy in their own hands. Building materials was the hardest department to work in."
good,Responsible for processing returned appliances. Included interfacing and coordinating the return of units to manufacturer. Also scheduling units for repair. These lead to various challenges which meant I had to make decisions as to the disposition and/or availability of inventory.
good,Steady pace on a daily. I learn things about the products we carry and what they are for. Our management could use a lot of team building skills. Everyone works together because they have to and not because they want to. The hardest part is dealing with unhappy people all the time. The most enjoyable part is hearing fun stories from customers.
good,Lowes has changed alot since i worked there so i couldnt really give an accurate review of it. It was a good place with good pay when i worked there. Family orientated.
good,"It was one of the most enjoyable, fun loving places I have worked . I learned more life fulfilling practices in the plumbing department assisting overjoyed individuals with stopped drains and clogged septic systems then I will probably use in two life times."
good,As a service manager you will be asked to do everything in the building and be responsible for everyone in the building. You will have to open and close the store alone or with one other manager and every upset customer or associate will be directed your way.
good,"Just stocked the shelves and then top stocked the rest."
good,"Under staffed for many important sales (Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.). Cashier training was severely lacking and most often I learned by experience as certain situations presented themselves."
good,"People here are friendly, but you need to be on your toes the first 30-90 days, if you have any sort of back injury or anything, I got fired, because of a previous back injury I worked through even though it had gotten better. Also a far drive if you don't live very close."
good,I loved working at lower but management doesn't care about your life or what you have going on in your every day activities. They are not caring or open minding about a lot of things that can happen in your every day life.
good,"Working for Lowes has been fairly enjoyable. I work about 9 hours a day with 2 breaks and a lunch. "
good,I worked hard and did my best to help all my customers. Management did not work well together. The employee moral was low. management did not communicate with employees the way they should.
good,Good starting pay and ability to grow. But leader ship/managment do not help and are not organized. You will learn new skills and have fun but only with and from other teammates.
good,Management was constantly changing. Lowes policy changed for the worse while I worked there. Never felt part of a team more just an individual. Felt that the staff reflected the management and was constantly lackadaisical in their everyday work.
good,Not a bad job if you're young. The pay is not good. Up and down shifts make it where you can't do anything except work during the week. It's an easy job.
good,"When I first started working there it seemed everyone got along.  Then people started leaving - quickly.  It became obvious the tension among the co-workers was terrible.  It is mainly due to the Management structure - you are encouraged to go to your team members for assistance, not your supervisor - and everyone is 'too busy' to help you.  You are left with a customer that is frustrated, not to mention yourself.  I would suggest to others seeking employment there to stick with the front end (cashier) or back end (stock) for a smoother work flow."
good,At most times it is slow paced with short bursts of activity. Mindless and repetitive work environment. Hard to deal with customers expecting very personal attention.
good,Pay is decent.Good benefits available. I like working for Lowe's until recently. Corporate changes are leaving stores short  staffed. I think I  would want to stay longer if there was more help. It just gets very frustrating when you are the only one in the department all the time
good,"The job is a high turnover job. Management doesn't really interact with you unless its to tell you that you did something wrong. Typical day at work is just standing at your post all day. If you wander a little bit or lean on something for support, you get yelled at."
good,"A place where the new restructure allows for the upper management to sit in the back office and stay on their phones, or just surf the net and this is allowed by the district staff WOW."
good,"Like many retail companies being squeezed by the likes of Amazon, etc ., Lowe's has begun the long slide towards becoming obsolete. Many of the people who once made the company great are now gone. Either retired or they were retired."
good,"The managers  in the two locations that I worked; in the cash room, and as a Head Cashier, were not very professional. There was far to much gossip and cut throated attitudes, mostly among the managers! Very unprofessional. After 4 months at the store in Chandler, Az. I left and moved back to California. The reason I left the position in Poway was due to the front end manager. She was a bully who enjoyed putting others down. To much power for this immature young lady."
good,Working in the paint department was such a rewarding job.  I got to see peoples excitement when creating a babies room or a remodel of a home or painting the outside of there home for an overall new look.  It was really special.  The only downside to working for this company was that it was really hard to get full time employment and some of the management just didn't seem to care. Or maybe they didn't like their jobs and would take it out on associates.  Co-workers were always friendly and helpful.
good,They do not have the full respect of the employees because to them it seems only upper administration is the most important.I have been there long enough to see how we r being treated and it's not fair at all .many have left Lowe's much like I'm trying to do .very few coustemers visit this store t I look for maybe a closing of this store soon or one day in the not to distant future.  I on the other hand I stayed oil bit to long it's difinantly time to move on.
good,"This is the best LP department in retail. We are assimilated into the business, and are not just body catchers. Our business knowledge is unparalleled, and we are involved in every aspect of the business. Extremely fast paced, a lot of responsibility, and high level of expectation. No room for slacking or low attention to detail!"
good,"Overall, a great place to work for ""people"" interaction and fellow employee interaction.  Customer interaction is a typical day at work.  I have learned many aspects about the home improvement industry."
good,"Understanding of employee needs, however managements hands appear tied by corporate headquarters.  Generally good work environment on a day to day basis.  Always UNDER staffed in customer service and out on the sales floor.  Computer system is old DOS!  Customers were great by and large.  Pay is on the low side for the responsibilities."
good,The day consist of making deliveries to customers. To many management changes and policy changes. Makes it hard to complete task. We break policy to please customers and no leadership in the management. Someday are short and some days are long.
good,Overall it was a great place to work in and the staff was amazing but unfortunately the store doesn't offer much financial opportunities or any incentives such as higher paying positions or opportunities to move up to management
good,"Not a bad place for a summer job. Simple, mindless labor. Coworkers were very nice, management could be easygoing or very strict on an unpredictable basis. Three weeks before I was supposed to leave to return to school, I was informed that I was accidentally deleted from their system, and thus no longer worked there."
good,"Initially I enjoyed working at Lowe's. The managers were nice, the job was simple and I respected my co-workers. When those managers were fired however and replaced with new inexperienced managers, things began going downhill. We were getting overstocked with nowhere to move freight, and they had no clue what they were doing most of the time."
good,"Day consisted off being assigned a particular area of the store (outdoor garden, front end, lumber). I was required to stay there until I was given relief for a break. I would ring customers up and help point them in the right direction if they needed help. Workplace culture was relaxed but a little disorganized."
good,"I enjoy being busy.  The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet on cement for 8-9 hours a day, having to clean the bathrooms.  (All front line had to clean the bathrooms), no work/life balance.  You only get one weekend a month off."
good,"Spent 13 years in management. Lowes had a restructure and I got kicked out of position. It is an ok job for temporary or part time work, I would not make it a career choice. Decent benefits, and decent pay considering the level of work that it is."
good,good place to work part time but as a full time employee its hard only get around 20-25 hours per week meet alot of people day just consists of cashing out customers an cleaning
good,"Love working with the people at lowes. Corporate has a tendency to make abrupt changes involving management, sales and customer service. I have been at lowes for three years and have gone from part time customer service associate, to sales specialist, to department manager over millwork, then to department manager over plumbing, back to customer service in lumber, and then specialist again, just because of corporate changes."
good,"The work is good, even enjoyable. The high turnover rate makes for a tense work environment. Easy to lose job over minor issues. Company restructuring"
good,"Mostly taking care of Customer Complaints and Deliveries."
good,"Enjoyed working with the team i worked with, management treated you like a number instead of a person.  "
good,"lowes in an ok company, always something to compalin about though, getting a raise is hard to come by, and even when you are doing your best it still isnt enough"
good,"I started as a delivery driver,delivering anything from lumber,patio furniture. a lot of appliances. And anything else they needed.I learned a lot and how to hook up all appliance except gas. I .I enjoyed learning the area and making new friends.I just could not  take the heat and pine pollen. After my husband finished his job we finally moved back to Michigan."
good,"good place to work. long and hard days. overall good. fun people, nice customers. Good benefits, fun meetings, comfortable clothing. Bonuses, vacations."
good,"Easy job"
good,The work is customer oriented and not that difficult. The people are all nice to work with. The hours were not the greatest. An entry level job at best.
good,"Come to work, get the job done, go home. Rethink your life. If you're going to school, it's pays your way for the time being until you can get into something you want to do as a career."
good,"Corporate America..... this store when it opened was great.... great management above & beyond customer service..... made a difference in the community...... but as time goes by, like everything else it has to change..... management, staffing & the big guys needing more money in their own pockets......"
good,"A typical work day involved making sure my department was clean and safe, down stocking product to the shelves, managing all my orders for customers as well as calling on estimates, putting away freight, assisting customers all over the store, and specifically in Flooring. I learned all about the different types of flooring, and how to install them, as well as putting together estimates and contracts for installation of those products. Management was good when I started, but changes in the structure of managers, and staff in those positions, led to fewer people being asked to do much more work, and it affected employee satisfaction and customer service. The hardest part of the job was trying to do my work as a Flooring Specialist, and cover the surrounding departments as well. There was just not enough time or help to do all that was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing from customers about how much they enjoyed their experience with me."
good,Not many chances for advancement which is based on how well you know certain management.  Changes happen although the company is not very good at implementing the change.
good,"My day varies depending on what comes in the door. Some days very busy and hectic, while others were slow and boring. Transactions could be quick and simple or extremely detailed and sensitive. Overall my day depended on the people around me. Days I am working with friendly and helpful managers and reliable coworkers tended to go well. We would all help each other out and work through whatever came our way. When we are not able to work together we tend to get in each others way and complicate tasks for each other."
good,"Good work ethic, good customer service, good management. Good hours , mainly hot most of time. Was able to fit time in to do things I need to do during the week."
good,Fun working environment with flexible schedule. Outgoing Co workers. Enjoyable shifts and managers. If you wanted to work outside in the garden department they would make it possible so you can enjoy working your shifts.
good,"The pay is better then minium wage, and the other associates are decent, but Lowes as a company has declined within the last few years. Management lacks. Little to no job security. No experience necessary."
good,Would not recommend  to anyone wishing to advance to a higher position. Very repetitive work and schedule is not conducive to quality family life. work early and stay late.
good,"Workload not evenly distributed "
good,"As stated in the above summary, ""just a typical retail/big box store"".  Have to deal with guests, and managers.  The managers tend to ""Micro-manage"" a little too much."
good,"As a Kitchen Designer, I put away more freight and sold more appliances then I did designing kitchens. "
good,"To much drive for change, even when is not needed.  Yearly rollouts make it difficult to be comfortable with job security.  Good benefits and associates."
good,"The best people to work with."
good,"Good company. It is retail. Be prepared to work without support. Full time can work as early as 5AM or as late as 11PM. Only one weekend off a month, one other Sunday. The other days off come in the middle of the week. There is a two week period where you will only be off a Sunday and Friday."
good,"If you like a high school work environment this is the company for you."
good,"Good place to work if you want a first time job , but hard to move up and usually short handed. management is okay, just not the best. ive worked there a year and a half and its time to move on"
good,"As a customer service representative, a huge amount of the job was taking returns, processing online orders, and taking phone calls. The pay can be okay as well as the benefits, however the management team is not always there to help you help others, and the tasks can be extremely stressful."
good,"Working with other co-workers is a fun part of the job, but the hours could be longer; other than that the pay's not too bad. Also having a set schedule is pretty cool."
good,"One of the largest recycling centers in the Southeast, processing an average of 500 tons of single stream material per day with a three shift operation and 100 employees. This facility maintains ISO 14001 Environmental Standards Certification, one of few in the United States."
good,"Alright work, workers were hard to find, contract ran out and the kept the worst workers and laid off the better ones. Money was laughable for what was required of the workers"
good,"Its an ok place to work if your in high school or college. Not a great life/work balance, lots of weekends to work and you work till 5 pm on the shift I worked."
good,hard work but people are great  day to day was complaining from staff about management.  HR only one who cared and she left because of the bull going on with Store Manager.
good,Lowes  was a fine place to work at . Over the years they have been slowly sliding into the same rut as other companies. Lowe's is still a good place to work at compared to other retail Companies. They have recently restructured their management program and all managers have been sent to the selling floor. We have 1 year to find a position in the store or we well be released. The pay cut would be quite drastic. I see no future there.
good,While I was there the management left much to be desired and they were very unwilling to work with you on hours when you had an emergency like a funeral. There were some long-standing employees who were kind and great to ask advice from but the atmosphere was pretty dramatic and the bedside manner left some to be desired.
good,"Just go to work and back home.  The Management is just so-so.  The work is not too bad, can't get help as needed with products weighing two hundred #."
good,"Good place to work, very friendly managers and coworkers. Work schedule is great and they help work with you to build on moving up in the work scale. Also, very encouraging work place."
good,"Word freight for 3-4 hours. Stock shelves with product or put in top stock."
good,"I love how I have job security. But I now dread going to work everyday. Since corporate changes in February things have gone down hill. Lowe's is a great place to work if you are a part employee who has another job, however if you want full time with flexibility go somewhere else. The policies are contradicting at times, and sometimes things are not that great. Overall I hope that I can find a new job soon so that I can start my career in the medical field."
good,"Working at Lowes has me on my toes with learning new sales and regulations. It has taught me to adapt fast with learning new management, sales, and programs."
good,"Good place to get started in the workforce"
good,Lowes is a great place for entry level and beginning a career in a retail environment. In a typical day you will interact with customers and associates working on a variety of tasks. The employees are mostly satisfied and the hardest part of the job is the constantly rotating schedule.
good,"A typical day would be assisting customers with product and answers, putting stock away and keeping your dept clean.  Customer service is imperative.  It's retail so there's a high turn over rate."
good,"Lowes is an Ok place to work at a great entry or College level job. To many old A-type personalities trying to cut each others throats to have any real chance of advancement. I f you want low wages and Managers who know nothing of the industry, great job for you."
good,Its great as a part time job. There was not much room for advancement in the work place.  They continually hired part time people to replace the full time people that left. Rarely ever worked more than 6 hours a day.
good,"Basically I worked for Lowes for 10 years or so. The pay is decent and usually above many other retailers including Home Depot. The raises are OK until you're maxed out for your department and then it's 1% every other year. Want more money? Become a manager. Oh yeah, they restructured so there are half of those positions available to obtain when someone doesn't already have it. You see good and bad managers as well. Some very helpful and then they'll become frustrated when they get called the most because they are so helpful. They're kindness can be a weakness. "
good,Very little interaction with management or other workers. Picked up work orders as available.Hard part-had to rent my own warehouse to house supplies. Cost of doing business was high.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of unloading boxes, stocking shelves and watering plants in garden I was Temporary/ seasonal so I was only there 1 month. I learned how to water plants properly. the work environment was okay for the most part."
good,management is terrible. job was good. you get professionally harrassed. my job was fun and pay was good. the structure of the company was always changing and made it very difficult to succeed.
good,Worked there for a few years and loved the people I worked with (well most of them anyway).  Some people don't want to work and most of management doesn't seem to notice.
good,Opportunity to do many different jobs and work with many different types of people. Very interesting dealing with a host of unique customers and their differing needs.
good,"This is a classic corporate retail company. High employee turnover and shuffling of store management. Its all about who you know to get promoted, versus the hard work you put in."
good,"Lowe's used to be a great company to work for. Over the last few years, they have gone from being employee centric to all about how much profit they can make, at the expense of cutting jobs and employee morale."
good,Decent place to work management is horrible but other employees generally pretty cool. Very fast paced work environment. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have no other option....
good,Healthy work/life balance among coworkers. Good teamwork atmosphere. Great use of technology. Employees are challenged to go above and beyond. Sales can be sometimes too pushy but overall a good place to work.
good,I worked for Lowes as a seasonal employee and was not kept on full time with the wonderful knowledge that someone less experienced  and less knowledgeable then me would be taking my position
good,Honestly working at Lowes has its ups and downs. There's some great personalities and nice people that work there but management & the higher ups make things uncomfortable.
good,The company takes care of employees as far as compensation goes but do not acknowledge the long hours put in by part time employees. management is disconnected from rest of staff.
good,"I worked my heart out for this company from the time I was 18 and still in high school. I worked there for 4 years at three different positions. The final two years were as a major appliance tech. I went above and beyond the call of duty based on my job description. There was a change in management and I found myself filling out paperwork for incidences that are just part of the job. No issues with my work until the final couple months I felt I was being pushed out. All of the paperwork which was to ""protect"" me turned into evidence to terminate me I believe because I was teaching top pay and they could hire someone to do the same job cheaper."
good,"Lower its a fun and great place to work with. when i worked there i was a unload associate , customer service associate, sales specialist, department manager. the best part is the people you work with management team is off"
good,Very high paced environment with varying age groups and ethnicities. Not to be taken lightly if you cannot lift 70lbs or more easily for 12+ hours a day. Wages vary based on performance.
good,"Staff was very friendly at first, depending on which lowes location the culture of the staff and customers was very different. Lowes as a company is very good, they compensate well, just be mindful of the location you apply for and how the staff communicates with each other before you decide."
good,"Some days you would deliver for 10 hours, some days 16 hours. Sometimes you would deliver a lawn mower, and some days you had to pack a washer or dryer or refrigerator up 3 flights of stairs."
good,"I only worked weekends, also the management there wasn't very consistant in teaching or guiding there employees, you would have to work there a long time before you were able to get full time."
good,"I love my job & co corkers but with the layoffs of several associates there is no job security here. Rumors swarm daily about the next group to be let go. We are all being replaced with part time help. It is  very unfortunate that Lowe's has decided to take this route to save/increase revenue. Many excellent workers no longer have careers."
good,"Typical day was to manage all cashiers. Upper management and other employees did not give needed/appropriate support. HR department is on site, this can be good or bad for employees. Large disconnect from corporate and store level employees. This is a large corporation and employees are disposable."
good,"Ok company to work for, hire outsiders above current employees. Sticklers about overtime. If you have a bigger store I hear it isn't as bad but small ones don't have enough employees vs customers"
good,Lowes is a awesome company to work for especially if you don't have a life outside of work.  When they hired me they said we have a rotational schedule that way you are sure to plan appointments and family time with your schedule.  That never really kicked in.  I had a coworker that was always out sick and there was only 3 of us in the department.  The manager always worked early so that left me for months working second shift. The pay was awesome and you basically had to know how to operate all the store machinery.  Many evenings I was the only person on the floor during lunch breaks and customers always complained that there is nobody around to help  them.  In the early part of the day the managers flood the floor with help and after 5 pm it is a ghost town
good,Changed management structure to hire more part time people.  Hiring is difficult to get people to pass drug and background checks.Experienced people leaving as over worked and little chance to move up.
good,"Lowe's has good benefits and decent pay if you're willing to fight for it. But, there is never enough coverage and you are expected to do others work."
good,"Working at Lowe's was not an ideal setting if you want a steady group of managers because they changed managers over the course of a few months. The managers usually would quit to leave for another job elsewhere. However, they would occasionally have free food for one reason or another."
good,"In 2015 Lowe's was still a fun, viable place to work with many advancement opportunities. In January, 2017, after a double digit comp year the CEO decided to restructure laying off over 2500 employees initially, and the number keeps increasing as the year progresses, all in order to report short term gains with, in my opinion, a very myopic look to the future of the company. "
good,"A typical day for me was being on some sort of power equipment pulling grills and lawn mowers down all day. The managers like to treat you awful too, but money is money."
good,"Great experience in retail, good sales training, and customer service training. Company has excellent required and optional training to help you grow and improve in order to move up in the company."
good,"Good place to work, but no room for advance unless you work there for 10 or more years, but i do like the 4 day 10 hour shift, Dont get much overtime especially around the holidays"
good,The best place ever when I was part time but you'll see what happens when your full time and your view may change or may not but all I can say is good luck
good,"This particular store is not extremely well run and is often times shorthanded with the exception of weekends and in the spring. They do, however place a great emphasis on safety"
good,"-typical day at work is down stocking building displays making the "
good,"Good company to work for, the people are even better. You must be open to an ever-changing retail environment with the ability to prioritize your work."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's its a fun environment, i enjoy working at a structured work area the only thing that was wrong with lowes is i want something else that i can advance in lowes is a great place but not much room for growth. I am personally looking for a job i can advance in to make a career out of not just a job. a typical day is the same as everyday there we get to work log in to our systems and our phones and start talking calls. the calls are usually help customers find products and set up delivery for them. Working at Lowes has given me better sales skills. I think the hardest part that was not being able to advance quick even if you are a good agent it takes a very long time.i enjoyed communicating with people, answering there questions, and giving them confidence in there purchase and the product."
good,"No chance to advance. Good place to work if you only need part time. Starts at minimum wage, 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.. Late nights, can close and open the next day if scheduled."
good,"there are many likeable people to relate to, however sometimes its easy to get caught up being told one thing, then having to be told another like you been doing all the hard work you been doing for nothing. there are benefits available that is only if they hire you on fully after having you for some time."
good,Under non- compete contract with the company.  I would prefer not to talk about Lowe's Companies.  Lowe's had a mass lay off in January of 2017 which affected thousands of people nation wide.
good,"Love the co-workers and fellow management staff, but the company recently has shown us that the room for advancement is very slim. This is good for sa part time job but would not recommend it for full time."
good,"Fast paced. Retail sales and seasonal, cashiering, inventory, loading and unloading, customer service. Good first job. Get to move around and try different departments and responsibilities."
good,The store I worked for wasnt the best location for me. When I was at the store in NJ I had a better experience. Being on register is annoying but it beats not having a job.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.  Pay is decent   Just very hard to grow in company. My store doesn't have best management.  A lot of favoritism.
good,"Not enough help"
good,retail sales/management.I enjoy the daily customer interaction and problem solving. Scheduling was always a problem. There are some advancement opportunities. Definitely requires team mentality.
good,"Working at Lowe's was a very eye opening experience. It changed drastically within the 5 years I worked there and most of the changes were good. The company offers competitive pay and benefits compared to most retail companies and while there are always short-comings most of the staff was well trained and helpful. My largest complaint was the upper management group. While they were nice and helpful to your face they back-stabbed constantly and would intentionally pass over qualified employees for promotions and ""promise something better they couldn't talk about was coming"". I personally knew there was ASM level managers that were sleeping with subordinates and using their power to either make things happen or ruin peoples prospects. "
good,not a enjoyable place to work at. Management was nreliable. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help help customers
good,Great people to work with. Lack in advancement. Management was not hands on. Lack of communication. Work not decided equally.
good,"very diverse company, gives all sorts of people opportunities to work."
good,"Day to day you never know if you are going to be fully staffed or running around covering several departments. If it wasn't for the few of us that were/are dedicated there would be days that when you pull into the parking lot you just decide to turn around and go home. The management is good at times but going through a rough point in time currently. "
good,"The first 11 years were great, was like a family.  I love working with the public and problem solving.  Every day was like and adventure.  Felt good when I left for the day.  The last 2 years were just not the same, it  was time to focus on my family and move on."
good,Great employees and support from all departments. It is not too fast pace but mainly steady. The managers do not manage as much as they should and rely on the employees to fix things that go wrong. The system of the store is more reactive instead of proactive which leads to a lot of customer service issues.
good,The company is very family oriented. They were very caring about there employees/Manager's they allowed you to spend time with your family and friends during holiday's.
good,"My review at Lowes was very interesting i worked up the ladder at Lowes i worked with many people enjoyed every one of them as a coworker . I enjoyed the challenges i faced daily with coworkers and customers  hardest part of job was you never new when the next challenge was going to happen , i loved the culture  and i got alot of exp . in different postions there ."
good,It is a fun atmosphere the people you work with are great.  However there is absolutely no room for advancement.  They also just laid off over 2500 employees.
good,Atmosphere was an awful experience. There was little accountability and those who tried were met with resistance. Training was negligible and there was very little commendation for successes. Personnel were downtrodden and attendance was awful. The operating systems do not communicate with each other and generated a great deal of consumer dissatisfaction.
good,"You cannot be a manager here, hold someone accountable they run to HR then you are being told they don't like what they said. "
good,"Lowe's creates a good work culture and goal setting for each store.  Retail budgets are difficult and creates a lack of employees to customer ratio at times.  If the store manager has a good attitude towards the corporate goals and ideas, the entire store seems to do well and that attitude reflects down to the employees.  However, if not then the store and staff suffer greatly.  This environment requires teamwork from everyone."
good,"Long days and rate of pay overall does not compensate you for your time and efforts.  Staffing challenges.  To be effective to the role that you were hired for the company needs to review staffing and ensure that there are ample associates to provide the ""Customer comes first service.""."
good,"Good place to work if you need to have an adjustable schedule. The location I was at seemed to have poor management and employees, not all of them, that did not belong in certain departments as well as trying to hid from customers. The location was also to relaxed on how the handled situations with employees. I would work for the company again, just not at the same location. I will say that a certain HR employee was outstanding when dealing with individuals."
good,"They have restructured me out once I was one of the lucky ones this time. I had stepped down a month before it happened. "
good,"Helping customers with their shopping needs, working the freight in between. Selling special orders, ie. water softeners, plumbing product. Setting up installs for the customer."
good,Working at Lowes is typical of any retail place. Loved my immediate manager and everything he brought to the workplace on a daily basis. If you can handle working in retail at part time this is a perfect place to work.
good,"I have only been with Lowe's for 3.5 years. It has changed dramatically for the worse as of late.  When I started, the future looked bright and I felt as if I was FINALLY in a company that truly cared about me and my family.  However over the past 18 months I could not be more wrong.  Benefits are dwindling and the balance between work and home is shifting away from my family.  I would not work here any time soon."
good,"Poor job in communication"
good,Company doesn't care about employees  only upper management.going through restructuring all the time and never know if your job is safe
good,"Good place to work for a couple of years, young management that has no ideal how to keep morale up. Needs better training before new hire go to the sale floor, need more training for managers and how to talk with there employees"
good,Not a bad place to work. Very strict on hours..no overtime. Mostly part time workers. Pay could be better. Delivery is a very physical job and pay doesn't match the work.
good,A typical day as a cashier at Lowe's is cleaning off your work area to prepare for customers. You turn on your light to signify that you are open and ready to ring up groceries. If your line is empty then you help your fellow employees with bagging. When you are ringing up guests you should make small talk with them.
good,"My day started quickly.  Usually from the time I walked in to the time I left my day was completely full.  I did come away with some valuable life lessons as well as technical and mechanical lessons that can be utilized at a later date or job.  The middle management spent entirely too much time micromanaging instead of giving instructions and expecting them to be done so that their managerial duties can be satisfied.  We were all adults that knew our jobs, there was no reason for management to look over your shoulders like a prisoner while you work.  In my opinion if you have that much time to watch me, pick up a tool and give me a hand, while you watch.  The hardest part for me was conveying to managment how impractical some of their demands were in the busy seasons.  Ultimately my deadlines were always met but only after i physically showed my managers the imposibilities they were asking of me would they secure help for me."
good,One of the good parts about working at Lowes was it gave me the opportunity to earn my certification for forklift operation and be able to move on to higher paying jobs to gain more experience. I never had problems with co-workers but ran into a few issues with management. The hardest part of the job wasn't the work but it was trying to remain professional in a non professional environment.
good,"good and bad, some stores are extremely close knit and provide a family like atmosphere, others are strictly stuck on old ways and not focused on the customer as they should be and the company has directed. overall good job,"
good,"Moved up many times in my career, still room for advancement, but cannot afford to live on my own...this company needs to do cost of living raises."
good,You are well paid for department managers but no communication with upper management. You are treated like just another employee. You have no power or control over your department and can not influence anything of change to increase sales. It is very structured and no leway to showcase your talents on merchandising. No room for advancement once hired for a position you are stuck.
good,"I was not a fan of working at Lowes in Gilford. My store manager was incredibly nice and a great man to work for. But the job itself was extremely difficult. There was no one in the store one minute, then the next minute there was a line of 6 or 8 people. The customers got away with way too much. They could scream in your face and still get what they wanted. Therefore more customers did it because they knew they could get anything they wanted. Of course there were many customers who were absolutely wonderful, but the few who weren't ruined it for me and I will never work in another large retail chain because of it. The pay is great and breaks are definitely long enough but definitely don't work here if you area a sensitive person or unable to hold your tongue."
good,Delivery manager was great to work for and the other employees in the department were always helpful and went above and beyond to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible/
good,"Loading/unloading Freight trucks in a safe and efficient fashion."
good,"In my 18+ years at Lowe's I had the opportunity to work with some wonderful teams that brought much business knowledge and technical expertise to the projects.  The teamwork and execution was enjoyable and exceptional.  My greatest interest has been learning the business, working with external partners and seeing the automation through to completion.  Being in the Integration/EDI arena, has enabled me to learn volumes about Lowe's business.  I have enjoyed working with seasoned, professional and diverse support groups as well."
good,"I have repeat customers who I enjoy helping, they know whatever they need I will make sure it gets done.For example I had a customer that purchased tiles and were waiting for more than 20 minutes. After several phone calls the tiles were brought up and loaded into their vehicle. They thanked me very much and brought me pictures of their finished floors. I enjoy working because of them."
good,"Lowe's can be a great place to work if you focus on the customers, support your coworkers, and don't take things personally. Advancement is possible, but can be difficult to facilitate."
good,"Nights are usually rough, because we're always expected to handle more than we can clearly chew."
good,"Like all big boxes, Lowe's is now consumed with the bottom line. People used to retire from the company as millionaires, receiving adequate pay, compensation, and job security. Now it's all about hours, low salaries, and revolving employees"
good,when management changed the store customer service and overall outlook change ed a lot of the customers were complaining of service. the new manager started in 2016
good,3am until 1pm  shifts started. Unloading trucks  and taking merchandise to sales floor. Afterwards putting away merchandise and clean up entire store before opening .
good,"The job was nice and the pay was good, but if I didn't have amazing co-workers like I did, I probably would have quit a lot sooner. The MOD had their favorites and if you weren't one of them you would always get the short end of the stick where they wouldn't answer calls if you needed help or they would put you in a position that they didn't have to see you for the whole shift."
good,OK to work there. As a delivery driver the management couldn't care less about you. No ot then they tell you to go deliver more. I don.t know what else to say.
good,"It was great experience working at Lowes,I meet good people there and learning different things is what I was looking for."
good,"The upper management team was very complex and not very willing to work with single mother's.  They promise they are willing to work with you and in the end write you up if you miss work because one of your children get hospitalized or sick.  They falsely keep you believing in advancement without following through. They don't stand behind policies and make them up as they go.  "
good,"I love working at Lowes, its because of the people that I work with and the customers. There is only two problems, one it some of the asm think that they are god and they can never be wrong. Second is you are just a body you can always be replaced is what I was told when I asked about hours."
good,"fast pace job co-works are supportive overall friendly environment it's a self train job you learn at your own pace while on the job. The hardest part of the job is finding a manager to help you, it's busy they mostly answer customer questions on the phone"
good,Lowe's is not a long term employer for most. It experiences a high turnover rate and the hours are variable including weekends and most holidays. The environment is always good for working and emphasis is put on safety. It is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
good,"Good employees, but they cram as much as they physically can into your work day whether its working 3 departments at once or doing tasks that logically need more than one person to complete"
good,"Was very safety concise. One of the few places I've worked that seemed to actually care about their employees safety. However, supervisors and team leaders were lacking in skill and knowledge."
good,"Employees do not leave jobs. Employees leave managers. This is the case at the Lowes in Prescott, AZ. Approximately 6 months into my Lowes ""career"" the store management changed. We went from a people oriented manager who made the store #1 in our market to a numbers cruncher. 110 employees left 1157 in 2015 and zero bonus were ever awarded during my tenure. "
good,"Retail in general is tough. Working holidays, weekends, and strange hours can make a person realize what matters most in life. Great for kids/adults who are either going to school or looking for training in people skills/"
good,"The management at Saugus Lowes leaves much to be desired, the ASMs and Store Manager tend to ignore what the lower level associates say. Overall it is a pretty friendly place to work as the associates tend to make sure that everyone feels included, it is rather easy to connect with coworkers."
good,"The work was quite tedious, but the most important thing that job will teach you is to learn patience. There is quite a bit of customer service involved."
good,"Decent place to work.  If you are lucky enough to get hired on as a full-time employee, the benefits package is pretty good.  Upper management has a difficult time communicating to the lower tiered employees making it difficult to provide excellent customer service.  Easy to get along with employees."
good,Non productive & extremely slow. I ask for more to do but nothing more is given to do always on the same position very stationary. Looking for a more productive and out going job/career
good,"Stock merchandise, water plants, assist customers, clean garden center, load merchandise for customers.  Fill internet orders.  Keep garden center clear for safety of customers."
good,Working with the public is rewarding. Upper management needs to show more interest in helping employees advance if they want to. There is to much politics as with any large company. Promised one thing and get something totally different. Co-workers are great have had no issues with the working grunts on the floor at any department.
good,"Very busy, very productive, learned how to cut wood, learned different types of wood, and different types of concrete mix. Hardest part would be nothing, everything is easy"
good,Lowe's was an overall good work environment with reasonable work requirements. The efficiency was largely determined by which managers were responsible for your individual schedule and work load.
good,"Close coworkers were all like family to me, had alot of regular co workers that were great to see and take care of"
good,"Hours of work beyond human standards.  Very little time off, difficult environment to enjoy your work.  Tension level very high, training was completed on my own hours."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's Home Improvement. I enjoy our motto ""Making Customer's Love where they Live"". I also have enjoy establishing repeat customer business with our great customer service. A typical day is stocking the store with the freight that arrived on the truck, assisting customers with questions in the Window and Walls area which also includes cleaning supplies . Tracking orders and keeping customers notified at all time of when to expect their products. Setting details and processing sales contracts. I am blessed to work in an area which has great ""team work"" although I can't say that is true for the entire store. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers repeat customers and becoming life long friends. The hardest part of my job is the rotating schedule from days to nights. It would be nice to have a consistent schedule."
good,Many seasonal employees that are not very motivated. Many people who have been there for a long time are very protective of their job.
good,"Working there was an experience, but I suffered many downfalls in the end. I got injured on site and I was only offered workers comp for one weeks worth of pay without any means of cooperation for approval through my administrator."
good,"hile working at lowesi obtained a new manager that had never worked in the field before, sinceihave for a while now i had asetway of doing tings fast and efficient. this manager however was on of those ""point finger and bark orders"" type of managers, so because she would constantly  give wrong directions, i didnt follow them."
good,"the job will require you to do mostly what is included in the job description. A forklift certification does help greatly, however getting a forklift certification can be a hassle with some associates fighting for over a year to get one, one must have a job that directly applies to forklift not all jobs that require forklift will allow you to get this certification then after the courses are done one must find a time the only person in the store who can certify has free time. the schedules can change at the drop of a hat sometimes half an hour before clock in time, when asked the managers have no idea why the schedule they made was changed."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work for, I have been working there for almost 3 years and the experience has been a blast. For anyone looking for a part-time job and enjoy people this is a good choice."
good,"slow paced work environment if you're looking for something casual. not much room to advance but if you can stick with it long enough and gain experience learning your trade, there may be promotions available"
good,"I started my dental career here, it was fun at first, it was just hard for me to get there seeing as it was in west valley and i did not have a vehicle, The dentist was great and fun people to work with in the office."
good,"Day starts off with a work-list larger than one could possibly complete. Attempt to juggle customers, stocking, receiving, ordering, shop keeping, placing advertisement, and keeping a positive attitude at a mediocre wage. The hardest part of the job is going day by day with little to no appreciation, you must find some way to make it enjoyable. The most enjoyable part is helping a customer that actually wants and appreciates your help. Being able to guide someone through the store and helping them make changes that will greatly improve their life is very rewarding. If the job was only helping customers, it would be better on an unbelievable level. You learn how to keep calm and prioritize. Management is pretty typical. There are department managers that issue out tasks and order materials. Assistant store managers take care of paperwork and make suggestions to department managers of an assigned zone. The store manager reaps the rewards of store sales and drinks coffee while sitting on a throne made of seasonal employee spines. Your co-workers become a second family, or in a lot of cases a part of your actual family. Overall it was an experience I am happy to have gone though. It has showed me a lot of ""what not to do"" and has given me some fond and awful memories to look back on. I suggest everyone work a retail job at some point to get a better understanding of the environment and to get ten percent off of purchases made in the store."
good,"I worked at Lowes for one summer and enjoyed it. I left and went back to school because all the people above me seemed chronically stressed and unhappy and I felt that was a bad omen for any kind of future career there! Knowing what I know now, I'd imagine they were working a lot of unpaid overtime. That's bad."
good,"I begin the day with my lists of multiple tasks and sort them by priority and begin the work day. Management was always available"
good,It's great until you get in management. Never enough staff to get help customer and get work done. Usually only one person per department most of the time. Poor training.
good,Lowe's is just like any other retail company. It's an employee mill. People complain about stuff on the job and higher ups don't care to much because there's always someone else out there that they can hire.
good,"You can only sweep, deadhead, and follow planograms as a merchandiser for plants before the boredom kicks in. Though it is fair enough that it pays accordingly to the duties involved, it is better to take part-time hours and have it supplemented with a another job."
good,"I worked there for 8 years and when i had my heart attack i realized that this store was literally going to kill me, Im only 29 yrs old.It can be an OK place to work if you dont care about ever seeing your family and friends or if you are in college because they will work around your class schedule"
good,"I started out as a part time worker, while going to school at Skagit Valley College. I then got a full time position when I got my Associates degree. I led a team of guys in receiving and was known to be one of the best teams Lowes ever had there."
good,"I come in the morning or afternoon. Look over the delivery board, plan my route. I ll drive the truck around to the dock door to load up. All appliances for that day are stage in our delivery bay where we unpacked all appliances expect the one with special request. I load on truck strap down get accessories. Manager signs off truck."
good,"Days some times got stretched out a little too long.  Management doesn't really get very involved when needed. Seems like corporate does not really care that much about the employees, more about the customers.  Pay was not bad, they expect a lot for what they pay."
good,Worked there for 3 years and learned a lot about Home Improvement. I interacted with some positive people. Worked as a team to provide customer service.
good,"It is a retail job, everything that you think you know about working in this field is correct for the most part. It is my co-workers that make this job enjoyable."
good,"I unloaded trucks, so I don't really have experience with the store as a whole. What I do know is that the job paid decently; you started out at around 9.50 and hour and got raises based on the number of vehicles you could operate. "
good,"This district manager had her favorites and never listened to anyone elses ideas or gave them an honest chance to succeed. Real training was non-existent but you were still punished for not doing things to expectation. If you made one mistake your career was over just like that in her mind, even after multiple years with company. It was like walking on eggshells. It was never fun. Too much worry caused and causes issues. I am assuming not all areas were like this, but you never know."
good,"lowes has its ups and downs, just like any other job. Nothing to really get excited about unless you are able to move up but doesnt really happen."
good,Like any work environment working hard to achieve the company's goals is the focus.  They hire great people who do make it seem more like a family than a corporation.
good,"A typical day at work would be to help any customer in need that approaches you or comes into the store, give them a kind, valued approach and find out all of there needs while they are with us in the store. Second comes to beginning and completing your tasks throughout your day, whether it be down-stocking product from our steel racking, to doing tasks around the store your manager assigned to you, to helping out other departments with there tasks, usually your days consist of a work list of some sort."
good,Stocking / Receiving /  Customer Service / Inventory Control / opportunity to train for new skills . Opportunity for Department management . Development in people skills and concerns .
good,"It was a decent place to work. I wouldn't call it an incredible career opportunity unless you have management or regional skills but it could certainly act as a place to acquire some great overall experience in customer service and warehouse. The pay wasn't great, but that's to be expected in retail, and for the sales support team (maintenance which I was on, receiving, load puller, etc.) our pay was no better than your typical salesman. As maintenance, the demands were incredible, the compensation was awful, and you've got to look over your shoulder constantly."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me was ensuring schedules was completed and coverage was across the front end area. Administrative office was processed daily with cash deposits and counts for the day before. My managers depend on me alot to make sure the store was running in a smooth manner across the front end. The hardest part of my job is the outside life, I have rotating schedule that consist of me working mostly all day and every weekend I wouldn't be albe to enjoy full days off unless I request or such."
good,When working for this company its a lot of differnt things you can learn at lot of different do it yourself in all areas of the store
good,Lowes had one of the best job work/life balance I ever seen you have time to have a personal life and it's great if your a college student you work 4 10-12 days and off the weekends the pay was ok but not great but it's a paycheck they also give bonuses at the month of the month base on production   the work was stressful but not bad if you not mind working hard and being on your feet the worst part of working there was the management not good at all very racist and they all talk about everybody felt like high school all over again the warehouse was full of Hispanics who didn't care if you were of another background which I didn't like this job would of been good if they had better people running the place overall average place to work god thank I found something better
good,"The store I have been working at the last three years has had major problems with upper management in 2015 (Store manager, LP manager, HR manager, and select assistant managers). Too many good knowledgeable employees have left or transferred to other stores. Only have a skeleton crew on the weekends most of the time, customers complain about lack of help on the weekends."
good,"Perform monetary transactions, refunds and exchange. Provide exceptional customer service and help customers with Q&A."
good,"This job requires a set performance each night which build towards a bonus at the end of the month. The higher your performance for the night, the higher the bonus."
good,"Lowes starts everyone just about as a Seasonal employee, I was a seasonal employee in the Lawn and Garden department and then applied as a Permanent Part time employee in the Hardware department. I wish that I could be full time and have requested this but due to Obama Care, they keep the full time staff in low numbers. This is frustrating."
good,"The company doesn't allow you to grow to your fullest potential. If they like you in a position , they keep you there. I would recommend this job to a single person. They are not very family friendly."
good,the best part about lowes is helping customers get what they need. the management has no respect for its employees they are treated like they are expendable. in front of customers and everyone else they smile but behind closed doors its alot of backstabbing.
good,It was okay. Not good for advancement. Management was horrible. Job schedule was crazy. Benefits are not even worth talking about.
good,"Lowes is a great company, but is still a""retail"" operation, with little to no experience in the ""real"" construction field. They struggle with getting quality contractors, and have a real hard time in enforcing the policies and procedures to their installation workforce. This has caused me to lose a lot of commission. My background in construction and construction management is very different from theirs. I believe the people they have in charge, from experiencing first hand, their M.O.D. suggests to me the people in charge have no strong aptitude in the construction field, but mainly in retail, two different worlds. I am treated well, and the benefits are great."
good,"My typical day at work included straitening my department, helping customers with what every they needed, and moving merchandise."
good,There is no chance of advancement especially for seasonal help. Managed by fear as opposed to mutual respect and loyalty.
good,"Overall a decent place to work. I enjoyed my job more prior to my transfer from Georgia to Florida . I originally worked as a Delivery driver the delivery department. is now contracted outside ,prefer to be on the road instead of in the store."
good,"its a fun work environment everyone has a positive attitude. the managers are always willing to lend a helping hand with disgruntled customers, if i can get everyone going through my lane to leave with a smile i know ive done a good job"
good,good job. not a good career. typical huge company attitude. you are a number. mine is 7 digits long. happy I got a job when I did but cant wait to get away from all the politics and become a person again
good,IT in this company is so unorganized. Too many divisions. Could not get things done for all the red tape. No documentation and everyone did not see to know procedures.
good,"great individual employees to work with , but management especially the head of the store , is in constant rotation and rules as a tyrant without care of employee moral"
good,"The environment is rollercoaster style. Depending on the associates available it can be very friendly and productive for customers, or it can be treacherous and outrageous. I learned how to handle each individual differently, but still keeping the rules in play. I am considered a problem solver and an efficient worker. The managers look forward to the days they work with me. They have the sense of security and that the day will be a great one with less conflicts. The only downside is there is no room for growth. Instead of allowing the associates to grow and develop, the management team prefers to hire outsiders into positions that can be growth for another."
good,"Relaxing enjoyable place to work. I enjoy working with the public, so this was a great job for me. The other employees and management were very supportive."
good,Being Lowes is a Home Improvement Store they have changes going on as the seasons change. The most enjoyable time for me was the Spring with all the plants and flowers being on display.
good,I like the place but their was very little room to move up in the corporation because they rarely ever hired internally. I really enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,"hard to move up in company. Always cutting hours but good to work for. benefits are great. Stock option at discount rate, medical eye dental insurance even part time employees get healthcare."
good,"Very good company to work for."
good,"Awesome company as long as you are a hard worker. The delivery Dept needs some real help the people above you don't do their work and are lazy and don't care about their drivers, but it boils down to leadership overall a great company unless you work in the delivery dept in this store 497."
good,I enjoy the job because I am a people person. I enjoy the people that I work with and like doing receiving . I like dealing with numbers and balancing out accounts
good,"Starting pay is great."
good,I loved the people i worked with for the most part but management was absent a lot of the time. Some of the management team was very overbearing and hard to deal with. There was a lack of staffing and in result there was always angry customers and it became very hard to deliver the exceptional customer service that people deserve with the lack of help on the floor and or management.
good,"The co-workers are wonderful and are always cheering you on as you succeed. Management is poor for when you take on more tasks and do they exceptionally well, you should be recognized instead of being disciplined with more work. The harder you work the worse management treats you. This is because they realize you are a hard worker and will do anything for the company."
good,Hired on to do a specific job but they send you to other areas to work or clean for the person who is in back visiting or talking on the phone.  Have clicks and if you don't belong you don't last long.  Learned alot about plants and dirts and mulches.  dealing with upper management was the most difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. They were great.
good,"They take good customer service employees and grind them down. Customers are dishonest and managers  just don't care. The hourly rate of  pay is good for retail, but when you have to cover 4 departments because there are no employees in the store, its easy to get over whelmed. There's no spiffs or commission so there's no reward for working hard. Managrs leverage their pay roll by reducing the number of employees on the floor to the point where its almost inoperable."
good,"The benefits are good. 15% stock purchase plan and a 401k Matching are very good."
good,"i really liked my job, moving to north NC and trying to secure employment in the corporate office proved to be difficult, after being considered for a position since 4/18 to find out almost 3 months later that you are no long being considered for that at position is heartbreaking."
good,"I usually begun by operating the forklift at 5:30 in the morning, then cleaning my department making sure there are no safety hazards. After that signing off on the daily safety checklist."
good,Lowes was a good place to work.  The co-workers were nice not as much lifting as it was detailed work. Best part of the job was the environment and the people the worst was the pay.
good,I would say that they could do better. When management doesn't care then neither do the employees. There could be better guidelines and much better communication. Overall it is a great place to work if you maintain relationships with the right people.
good,Work can be very productive. There is always something to do. Most of the employees are kind with a few exceptions. As an unloader my job requires unloading freight trucks that can have loose items or heavy items that can cause injury yet I do not have any benefits due to being a seasonal employee.
good,Great team to work with. Allowed to to work in different parts of the store if you where qualified.You get to work with a wide range of different customers.
good,"Lowes has a E2 performance program that causes an unsafe work enviroment , with this program workers are paid by their work performance that make a lot of people drive around on equipment to fast and sometimes unaware of their surroundings"
good,"Coming into work was a great experience. Everyone says hello and I go back to my office. I have to get my book of tasks done and signed from the manager on duty for the day. I work on my tasks until I complete them all. My installers come in for the day for their assignments and for their materials for their installments. I walk back to receiving and I retrieve the product and materials for each installer who walks into my office. I sign them out and they are off to their customer/install for the day. I take phone calls from installers/customers on how the install is coming along. If there are any issues bad or good I have to either apologize and take action and make my customer happy, or thank the customer for giving credit for the installers great workmanship. I also take calls from the installers home office good or bad and take heed to their requests, and make sure everything is in order and everything is running as it should be. I make phone calls to customers for install reports, for materials and products ETA dates or if they have arrived, call manufacturers to check on materials and product for ETA dates, and just make sure everything is running smoothly. I have to get  the product and materials ready for the next day installs. I have to run the floor to make sure desks are informed of any changes or if the sales person has any requests. Sometimes I have to go onsite to see how installs are going... make an assessment of the job being installed, talk with the customer and see how they think the job is being done. Get the reports ran and filed for next day. Clean up office"
good,"Pay was excellent for the work, however management did not communicate between departments.  Manager regularly scheduled me outside of my availability, did not inform head cashiers about any corrections."
good,"I come in, I look and see if there are enough carts for the customers to shop, I go down every aisle and see if there are any safety hazards or if merchandise needs to be put back on the shelf, clean and dust mop the whole lumber department"
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for but the the particular store I worked for I did not agree with the way they handled employees.  Cutting part-time employees hours down below 10 hours is ridiculous.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of daily chores within my designated department along with tending to customer needs and requests. I learned, through a system taught, how to initiate good customer service. I also learned through working with professionals home improvement skills. Management around the time of my departure was not the best; I believe it could've been better in some areas. My co workers were great; helpful. The hardest part of the job was time management. The most enjoyable part of the job were the friendly customers"
good,"My first CSA position with Lowe's was in the Seattle area.  Job was great and training terrific.  Co-workers all worked hard and followed the rules put in place.  Management was superb."
good,good company to work for but hours might be limited based on seniority. staff is knowledgeable and is always willing to train new and veteran staff.
good,"As far as retail jobs go this one pays better than many.  However, it requires a lot of technical knowledge to work on the sales floors and a lot of physical work.  Full time employees also only get one weekend off a month."
good,"You come in at 7am and do everything yourself because nobody did anything they were supposed to do to help out. Then you get yelled at because you took too long to get things ready. You worked through lunch because there isn't enough time in the day to do everything. Your tired because its dark now and you work and average of 10 to 16 hours a day. Because your tired you accidentally scratched that customers floor when you rolled their new fridge into its hole. You get back and you get yelled at because you cant do your job effectively. You go home and eat a late dinner alone and try to get to sleep for the next day. You never know when your going to get off work so every day is shot unless its your day off, but you only get one weekend off a month. You do this for 9 years and now you want to further your education but you don't have a good schedule to go to classes consistently. So you ask about changing you schedule only to be told they would have to move you to a different position where you make less money. Now you cant afford your everyday expenses so you opt to just stay where your at. Then you come in the next day and do it all again."
good,"It can be a fast paced place to work and I like that, but I do not like the hours, but with any retail job, the weekends are the busiest."
good,Was going good until my fianc√© went into labor and I got fired for leaving early to go to the hospital. The work was hard on my back.
good,"Una empresa joven en M√©xico que tiene bastante potencial y de igual manera mucho por aprender. La empresa ofrece cambios inmediatos basados en experiencias de los mismos empleados. Los altos mandos no est√°n conscientes de lo que sucede a nivel tienda, de manera que el corporativo y Lowe's no est√°n bien comunicados."
good,Not to much balance with the job and my life with hours being so scattered at part time.  Full time would be ideal. Overall the management is good and so are the employees. Even the customers were were a delight to work for most of the time!
good,There is very little room for advancement and it is a physically  demanding job. The hours versus manpower ratio is huge.
good,I learned different types of wood for different projects. Hardest part was pleasing every customer. The most enjoyable part was working with some close friends.
good,Its an alright job but theres is no room of advancement whatsoever . They rather hire employees who never worked for lowes then even considering their own employees for the same positions or better ones.
good,"My experience in Loews Shared Services started out decent enought but they were just opening and there were alot of 'bugs in the machine'. Over the years, it seemed to get worse however, with management changes that ruined what seemed to be initially a fun cultured environment. They also do NOT pay well at all! The only perk is the hotel discount. If not for that, I'd have quit within my first 6 months."
good,"Benefits are good, but they are not adaptive to different personality types. You need to fit their mold, or you will not advance."
good,"Sole plumbing needs, maintained department by keeping shelves and bays stocked with product. Organizing and cleaning at all times when not helping clients."
good,it's an okay place to work the management needs a lot of work and training though. I hope they don't get too many to quit. I had to stock many of the shelves but most of the time I didn't know where it was supposed to go.  I often times end up doing a lot of the work by myself and my co-workers never seem to want to help.
good,"Like with any retail job, compensation is low and management is so so.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience and met some great people along the way."
good,Wonderful face to face customer experience . Loved to see familiar face and help aid customers with all their home improvement needs.
good,"A typical day in the garden department consists of watering all the plants multiple times a day, and stocking all farm/outdoor/gardening products. I learned a lot about seasonal plants working in the outdoor department, but in addition I learned how to operate a sit-down forklift, a stock picker, and how to count inventory. Management could be better at Lowes, many managers don't communicate between each other so often times employees get too many tasks at one time. The co-workers were very knowledgeable about their departments, and a majority of them were friendly. The hardest part of working at Lowes is keeping up with all the tasks assigned throughout the day, but the learning experience can be worth it."
good,"Always learning and worked with very considerate people. Also, it was very flexible and they worked around my other employment."
good,Lowe's is a decent job for those either in transition or in school. I don't recommend it as a career if you want to make more than $16.50/hr. It takes 4 years to max out at that pay. The schedule and job stability is nice.
good,mucha precion pero no de ptabajo  favoritismo no es pareja la carga de trabajo
good,"The employees make working there great, but the company itself is flawed.  moving up in the company is not as easy as one might think."
good,"Working for this company was a good learning experience,got the opportunity to learn products, working with co-workers was  nice ,different cultures, I enjoy  mixing paint and give customers ideas of colors and faux finishes, enjoy sales events in blinds."
good,"I worked at two Lowes location.  Where I was first hired at, I loved the management and job culture. Management were eager to help floor employees, and consistently gave encouragement to work harder. The store I am currently at is very disorganized, biased management, preferential treatment, (but again nothing due to company's policy, just managers in place are not up to task on hand). It is not a career, in my opinion, but a job."
good,"challenges include outside regardless of weather.  Customers are friendly, and most want to be treated properly.  Management wants rules followed.   Usually not much is difficult."
good,"Enjoyed working here great co-workers not so great management"
good,"They were ok, wouldn't work for them again though. The other employees are good guys but the management needs a lot of work."
good,The work environment at Lowe's is friendly and inviting.  Management is a bit hard to talk to at first but then they are quite personable.
good,"Very well over worked, never time for your family.  Too many long hours and the management staff is awful."
good,I had a great time working at Lowes. Being a head cashier was a great learning experience. I had the pleasure of working with and counseling cashiers. They are all about pleasing the customer and they are sticklers for great customer service. I learned a lot in the time I was there. All employees got along and it made for a great work environment.
good,"I loved my job. I processed returns and gave refunds. I learned how to talk to people in a way that leaves them happy and satisfied with products. My managers were always friendly and helpful. There were a few too many of them and at times they would all give different directions on things. My co-workers were always friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, but it was always nice when they left happy."
good,Retail can be tough and the position I held was demanding but I enjoyed it. I worked very hard to make the store safe and to increase the profitability of the store. I enjoyed being independent from the store side and using my own discretion and having the ability to problem solve.
good,"Sold flooring materials/ jobs to customers."
good,"Wake up  at 2am to be to work by 3am. I learned a lot about how to read ben numbers and Location numbers, Management we never see as a freight team member because we should up earlier then anyone else. Most my co-workers are older then me but they make me feel like apart of the team right off the bat, the hardest part of my job is only having four people working morning freight when we are supposto have 8-12 people"
good,"decent entry level sales position"
good,"A very fast-paced, detail-oriented position that included communication with stores, clients, and vendor negotiations, cost analysis of programs, setting up new stores and items for stores, and balancing multiple tasks and programs."
good,"A usual day consists of providing customer service to customer throughout the store, while maintaining good store appearance by receiving and processing freight, stocking shelves, and keeping aisles clean. Also, assist delivery team in delivering merchandise."
good,"Stocking"
good,"Very fast paced job and you are always playing catch up with orders and customer issues, install issues take most of your day and also driving the sakes side of the job can takes its toll at the end of the day. Managing Associates is the best part of the job, the interaction and celebrating the wins are fun and bring life the store. Management has no direction, always out on your own trying to figure if we are all on the same path that we should be."
good,A typical day at Lowes was pretty good.  Customers were great and friendly. Most of the management were great.  Enjoyed working with my coworkers.  I was mainly placed in the garden center running the register and answering customer questions.
good,Lowes good place to work for after high school. But very little advancement in the store I was in. Management didn't care about employees and really didn't care about anything except themselves. Good company to work for if your in the right store and good friend with management.
good,They have good benefits for part timers. Lowe's feeds employees on holidays. They offer online training courses for current employees.
good,"It's a typical retail establishment, but I was able to move up which made it exciting, but it was very hard to work there during the economic downturn..."
good,"Day is very hectic.  Management rules on the fly.  Sometimes doesn't know which end is up.  Too task driven, always has to answer to Wall St. so there will never be enough help in the stores.  Now down to one cashier most of the time at the front.  What ever you do is never enough.  Mgmt. cuts payroll on Friday so Saturdays always start behind and never ready for business on Saturday morning. Advancement is by who you know not what you know.  Some employees are on their 3rd or 4th final notice.  Mgmt. is afraid to fire anyone. Corporate office doesn't listen to field personnel.  Good people in the ranks...some managers couldn't find their way out of wet paper bag.  Used to be a fun place to work, but HD is leaving them way behind in sales and service.  Employee surveys are done to make management aware, but then no action is ever taken."
good,great people doing great service management can be tough also will be pulled in a lot of ways at once
good,"Moving up is tough for certain kind of people, too many supervisor, bosses, managers just a few regular employees. All bosses above you go different directions."
good,Loved the travel aspect of the job but did not like not having a steady work schedule throughout the year.
good,"As long as you are good with people and are patient, working at Lowe's is easy.  Once you learn your department, and the layout of the store, providing customer assistance is easy.  Stocking and closing your department is where the difficulty can come in; it all depends on your store and your staff."
good,Started as seasonal employee. Avg 20 hrs per week. Hours may be cut due to lack of business.
good,"Greet and assist cumtomers handle money, credit/debit,check transaction est."
good,"Arrive to work ON TIME, maintain cash registers, keep a clean and tidy work space, and assist customers. I learned about different items sold in the store. I really enjoyed scanning things."
good,"A day at Lowes is always a new and different experience. My job title says that I am a Kitchen Designer but due to staffing I may be required to cover a number of other departments at a time.  My co-workers experience the same thing.  Most try to do their best to do their job and help the customers.  Like other places I have worked, there are good managers and some that need improvement in a number of areas.  I enjoy helping customers with their projects.  It is frustrating when some customers take advantage of the system to get money from the company."
good,"A seasonal position."
good,As a major retail store I like the training and structure of the work place.
good,Customer service was expected to be the best and I believe I delivered that. Product knowledge was required and I would strive to learn as much as possible about the products we carried.
good,A great retail environment.  Co-workers work as a team. Lowe's is a rewarding job.
good,Great group of employees to work with. I had great support with the employees because of team work.
good,Starting out it was a different experience because I had little knowledge of hardware materials. I had a good crew to teach me and mold me into a great customer service associate.
good,Lowes is playing catch up to the internet age. The programs and systems are out dated and the new ones are full of gliches. Management is pushing forward dispite these issues. Communication on goals and focuses are conflicting and contradictory. This makes for a frustrating and stressful working enviroment.
good,"I began at the Lowe's in Grand Junction, CO.  Awesome staff and management.  I had to transfer to the store in Superior, CO for personal reasons.  Very disappointing as the management was terrible and ultimately was the biggest reason I moved on."
good,"You can learn a lot about Retail and big volume stores.  You will most likely cross-train to learn different positions (e.g. cashiering, hardware, flooring, electrical).  If your managers like you, you can be promoted quickly and have the ability to travel to other stores."
good,"a typical work day was ok, I worked primarily on my own, beginning of the day shift was Inventory Replenishment reports and restock. do order management on special orders, call customers and follow up on any order changes/updates. my co workers and I as well as department manager were like a family. Hardest part of job was conflict of what customers needs and managements needs. The most enjoyable part of job was the customers. I have met and befriended the best people I am still friends with today."
good,"When management changed the entire work ethic changed,"
good,help with customer service until close then unload trucks then restock lumber department and set store for opening
good,"no room to advance with this company, seems as though they only want to offer promotions to much younger staff"
good,Lowe's Home Improvement has taught me a lot of skills. I know how to run departments alone with providing great customer service. I enjoy interacting with customers and employees.
good,"I didn't like working for Lowe's for many reasons. There was never a set time off, it varied from week to week. There are too many managers involved which makes it hard to make a final decision on anything. And, most of the policies and procedures are unreasonable."
good,"While it is a productive environment and the associates are great, but communication between the employees and management is very weak."
good,"Good work environment, good job advancement, it is easy to transfer to a different department once you have the proper training"
good,"fast pace, co-workers are friendly in your department, learning about  plants, do your job the correct way and you go only to your immediate supervisor, loading large items into vehicles, going home"
good,"A typical day started with cleaning up the backroom to begin work and then opening up the truck to unload the freight mostly by hand and some palletized products."
good,"At Lowes each day provides new and exciting opportunities to learn and grow, while helping customers with their home improvement needs."
good,"They seemed to really appreciate their associates, which means a lot to their associates."
good,"Operate gas and electric forklifts"
good,"worked at numerous lowes locations for over 11 years, raises are harder to come by, but increased responsibilities are innevitable. upper management is almost non-existent, (hard to find on the sales floor). training, direction, and evaluations (these are self evaluations, score yourself whatever you want, its pointless) are almost always done on the computer. its a very disconnected work enviroment due to the hard push toward technology. a company that netted 2 billion dollars in 2012 would rather buy trinkets than re-invest in its employees."
good,"just a simple but strict place to work. i loaded and unloaded cars, got buggies, ran a cash register, and did other minor stuff."
good,Wonderful place to work with wonderful co workers only thing i didnt like was the management team.and how they dont pay attention to anything thats going on in the store unless they don't like a specific person
good,Load trucks for delivery then when out on the route that's when all is good but as soon as you get back that's when things get a little shaky! The problem isn't so much as management working but its when things go bad they tend to throw everybody they can under the bus rather than take blame for their short comings. Its just at the Southlake Texas location!
good,"Night stocker- Unload delivery trucks, stock shelves, read planograms, reset and clean shelving, label new product, build pallets of overstock and use machines to top stock over flow."
good,"I liked working at Lowe's it just didn't work well with having back issues.  With all the lifting and getting up and down from the floor to stock shelves it put a number on an already messed up back.  One day my back suddenly got so bad that I couldn't bend over let alone move.  But since I was only Part-time working just shy of Full-time hours I couldn't afford to not show up for work since I didn't get any sick days.  I asked for Full-Time almost every month but management just ignored me or got rid of the full-time position in my department.  I didn't want to work other departments especially ones I knew nothing about, because I would be asked specific question about the products and I couldn't answer them and the person in the department was on lunch and I couldn't ask them.  The downside of Lowe's is they want everybody to know everybody's department so that they can put you were ever they want you and not where you want to be.  I liked working Paint and Home Decor and I didn't want to work anywhere else, mainly because of my back.  The other departments required typically more and heavier lifting.  The other problem with Lowe's is if you go full-time you have to have complete open availability or they won't hire you unless they have a part-time available and you go for that.  So if you want two jobs this one would have to be part-time."
good,"A typical day at work involved me greeting the clients as they came in and walking them to the treatment room.  I would then draw up the vaccines for the veterinarian and prepare fecal samples if necessary. I would go into the room with the veterinarian and restrain the animal while the vet looked at it and gave the vaccines. Afterwards, I would go prepare any medications that the veterinarian felt the animal needed.  I would then go back into the room with the client  and explain how to use the medication and answer any questions the client may have."
good,"I loved my co-workers, but unless you want to suffer being management where everything is your fault, not much room to advance."
good,management were unaware of what was going on at times. learned to work as a team not individual. co-workers were better working as teams then indiviual like the management wanted.
good,The job was very mundane; there was very little motivation amongst all employees. There was a lot of busy work that did not mean anything and corporate was always breathing down your neck.
good,Worked to get credit lines or increased lines for contractors.  Learned about the building industry.  Management was pretty good.  Co-workers were nice.  Hardest part of the job was getting credit lines increased.  Most enjoyable was learning about the building industry.
good,"I did a lot of different types of jobs working at Lowe's. I learned how to do their spread sheets and how to do job orders. I also learned how to look up records and talk to venders. The hardest part of the job was learning the scanner and how to run it. I drove a verity of tow motors and worked on team leader jobs. I would deal with other employees on a day to day basis and not just my team members it would be all over the whole area, like building, shipping, electronics."
good,"My time at Lowe's was a great experience overall.  The store managers tend to set the culture of the store which determines the happiness and enjoyment of the store.  Out of the 5 stores I was at, I would say 4 out of the 5 stores provided a positive work environment and success was developed out of that."
good,"days were filled with lots of work which I loved, and seeing the same customers all the time was enjoyable and building relationships with them was a plus. Loved my coworkers. However, the management made it very hard to do the job. There was a lack of communication within management and they always promised things they did not deliver later on."
good,"typical day is fast paced always on the go during summer months, and i learned communication skills with the public. the management was good and there wasn't entirely hard about the job. the co-workers were great and the funnest thing about the job was that you could make it fun through out the day"
good,"Although the training and advancement opportunities were impressive, the retail environment became a bad fit for my personality."
good,"At the beginning of my career it was a great place to work but the goodness of the jobs fades away...it hard to move into a promotion...once you get in to one and you find something else they are reluctant to let you move....this is because you know too much or are too good at the current position and they just want to sit there and let you spin your ""wheels"""
good,corporate buy the book. not a big fan of how they treat their employees. kinda like walmart.
good,Customer service is the core of what Lowes is about. The company makes sure that all customers are taken care of no matter what the issue is.
good,"I always enjoyed those I worked with, though advancement opportunity was underwhelming. Working in one area for so long made me weary."
good,Not my carrier choice to work in warehouses.  Co-workers are not educated and the work is menial and redundant.
good,Job allowed opportunity to interact with customers.  Learned a great deal about building materials as well as other household items.
good,"loved working with the customers "
good,I will simply say that I am looking for a work environment that values hard work and rewards it.
good,While Lowe's is not perfect it is one of the better retail environments. They tend to hire older people for their staff and tend to avoid hiring teenagers which leads to a more professional environment.
good,"CONSTRUCTION PRODUCT SALES "
good,"Great place to work, but no support from company in job training."
good,Great benefits.... employee discounts..fast pace....able to transfer from one store to another .. opportunities to advance
good,not very fair or friendly to employees. definitely not worth the stress
good,"Daily reports, opening and closing swap accounts, checks and balances, resale list...."
good,"Lowe's is aiming for PT workers with a high turnover. If you are a hard worker then they will expect you to pick up the slack from those that are not. If the managers really like you then you can advance, if not you will be PT for years no matter how many times you apply for FT positions."
good,"All in all, it's a good company to work for. Co-workers were a GREAT group of people. Management had serious issues. Zero opportunity for advancement. Management did not back associates up. Benefits were not much to brag about. A lot of stress on the job."
good,"I would greet customers at the checkout and ring them up at the register. I would also ensure I performed all proper loss prevention procedures properly and help with the loading of merchandise and tools. Hardest part of the job was every once and a while I would load a water heater all by myself. Other than that staff was helpful, management supportive and I learned a thing or two about home improvement."
good,"Lowe's doesn't really work with your family life if you have a family, its pretty much their way or no way."
good,"Enjoyed meeting all types of people. I enjoyed working with my co workers and still have a friendship with some, I enjoyed working hard at lowes"
good,"Interesting work, direct management listen to suggestions."
good,Management was racist. Hours were good but the people were not
good,"Never having the same schedule. "
good,"Lowes is, from what I've experienced, the best 'job' you will find out there as far as making decent money. But for someone like me, who has never been really confined by strict rules and regulations when it comes to assisting guests, I find it difficult to say that I will make this my career. It's not a bad 'job', but it's not something that I will say will benefit me as a person for a career choice. Overall a stable company and reliable income; just not for the individual who enjoys moving around and doing as much as possible when assisting guests."
good,Company could be run better if the requirement of management was higher
good,Working as a delivery assistant consists of a substantial amount of lifting and moving product ranging from light to heavy. Slightly stressful days involved moving appliance and delivery to various locations daily.
good,"After many years and not a lot of pay increase, I decided to leave to look for employment with better pay and benefits."
good,Good company to work for if you're looking for part time work or to pay off college.  Not the strongest with team development though.
good,"A retail store that has home improvement items for sell. Very fast past store that deals with orders(special and in-stock), returns, installs, and purchases. Enhanced my skills in customer service, administrative work, and sales. Gained experience in pricing coordinator positions and Head cashier. Even though Lowes is a great company to work for. Management is a little difficult to work with. Co-workers are very easy to work with. The hardest things about the job is keeping up the day to day past of the job. Once a individual has that down packed, then the job was is fun."
good,"a typical day at lowe's was fun look forwards to go to work and work with my co-workers, Trained on the following order picker power equipment, Power Tools, Computer and warehouse operating system"
good,On a typical day I kept a friendly and helpful attitude while ringing out the customers purchases and answering questions if they needed help. 
good,nice place to work training is top shelf alittle unorginized
good,"Busy ringing  customers, answering phones. We really didn't get our breaks or lunches on times especially if we were short staffed. Pulled a lower back muscle and they didn't want to give me a position to accommodate me.   "
good,The company itself is good to work for although as with most other places certain people in management pick favorites. The job itself isn't bad at all and the people I work with are good people. I enjoy dealing with the customers because there's always something different to deal with and when there's a problem the managers are usually good at dealing with the problems.
good,To load and unload customers.  to maintain the cleanliness of my canopy area. to control the inventory.
good,"Crazy schedule, meet fun people. Unrealistic expectations sometimes with workloads. Upper management doesn't listen well to lower level employees. "
good,Working at lowes for the most part was great i enjoyed meeting new people they just didnt have the best staff whats so ever i loved my employees that i worked with i just thought it was time for me to advance and some what mainly just get out of the atmosphere that was present in the store its one thing to work for a company but to be able to come to a place and know that there on your side to help for the best is the greatest and at lowes i didnt recieve that. im a hard worker and i love working just being appreciated means alot at times.
good,A typical day at work is fast-paced and there is always more to learn.
good,"First hired as WE Team, moved up to Lumber and got lees satisfaction within the job. Transferred to another store that was 50+ miles away just to get a full-time position. Did exceptional work with nothing but bad publicity. Management was unsuccessful with hiring the right people and unruling when it came to firing people"
good,Our store manager was straight out of school had no experience with how to run a store which made it hard for not only the employees but the customers as well
good,I was quite happy with my job. I enjoy Cashier work and always have. The people I worked with were very nice and always helpful until I need to have time to sit for my fibromyalgia then half my manager were never told I need to sit and the other half refused to let me even with the doctors info and all set forth. It was just a mess to get all done
good,"Good place to work, southern mindset, though. More reactive than proactive. "
good,working there is ok they pay ok over all is ok for some to make extra money
good,"I would not work for lowe's again because of broken promises and managers that only looked out for themselves. I was promised a raise after 3 months that I never received, because our HR manager was out for 2 months. Also, certain people thought they had a lot more power and were never reprimanded for their abuse toward subordinates."
good,Everday was instresting never a dull moment. I loved my job and my customers. 
good,"Constantly understaffed (understatement), very stressful work environment. A lot of physical activity, including rigorous lifting of heavy material. Upper management members do not get involved with the departments in their areas. Upper management does not communicate with members of lower management. Upper management using poor language and inappropriate tones with lower level associates. No mentoring or attempts to ""develop"" lower level employees with potential. Having to deal with difficult, self entitled customers. Limited to no organization with communication methods, delegation, and even current promotions. "
good,"My typical day consists of: helping customers, receiving and processing freight trucks, talking/working with vendors and management to improve customer experience and sales, and resetting merchandise on the selling floor to boost are sales along with our margin.       "
good,Its good except some managers. store morale was not good. job security was always iffy.
good,"Providing schedules,worklists and customer satisfaction"
good,An excellent company to work for with good benefits.  Hardest part of the job is the retail setting and dealing with complaints. 
good,"-Receive daily work list from Store Manager, and complete them before my shift is complete."
good,PSA Set up displays through out the store work with customers. a lot of good people on the sales floor to work with Management had this attitude like they were better then the sales people on the floor who did all the work and made them look good .Managers would not back up there own people if something went wrong. in this store anyway Concord NH I see why most of those people were managers because they had know work ethic most of them were lazy to be a manager at Lowes all you have to do is delegate my own boss could not do my job LAZY PSA MANAGER know work ethic at all likes to shop when on the clock but she is management that is ok but don't you do it you will get fired.
good,"Could be better with promotions,higher incomes will be better,more hours also,better benefits would also help,more appreciation for the task we do as an whole team day in and out."
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced sales environment with a lot of multi-tasking required. Customers are ever present, so completing day to day tasks required in each department can take a while due to providing good customer service to each person."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is most of the coworkers.
good,"Workig with customers o a daily basis i have worked at the service desk helping customers with any problems that may have arised, running a cash register, maintaining customer focus throughout the day."
good,nice place to work. gets kind of boring though depending on your job.
good,Good place to work except the pay doesnt balance out for the tasks you have to do everyday.
good,Good benefits. Enjoyed working with contractors and customers.
good,"I was working full-time and also attending school.When i was finished with school and spoke to my manager that I needed to do an externship, she gave me an decision to either continue working at Lowe's or I would have to be fired because they could not work around my schedule."
good,"Lowe's was a company that was very customer driven. I enjoyed working with customers who were repeat customers. A typical day at work meant standing at the register, but the customer interaction made it go quickly. I enjoyed helping people and finding out about their projects."
good,"Well, I was laid off after a month, so I wasn't too happy. It seemed to be an ok company to work for other than that."
good,had a few issues with sexual harrasment
good,typical day at work was good
good,busy but was productive
good,"A typical day consists of zoning stock, assisting customers with projects through sales and information, loading wheat straw, pine needles, and other outside/plant soil or fertilizers, tending to the plants located in the garden center, and safety checks throughout the store."
good,"It's very fun place to work. You get to meet many different people work with different people. Its a learning work place, also a very busy work place, but over all it a very good job."
good,I did my job to my best ability that I could. I had good days and not so good days.
good,"I worked for Lowes for 5 years and most of my coworkers were really great to work for but the management was very hard to work for, Each manager seemed to be on a different page. So it sometimes felt like you were torn on what to do in any given situation."
good,"Basically Lowe's when you start they treat you very well, but the longer you stay they start to treat you worse and worse, reasons for this are unknown to me. Managers don't seem to be qualified for the positions they have been given. The customer service aspect of the company is mediocre at best. Their main focus is to push sales first and customer service is second or third in terms of importance. Their ""open door"" policy is almost non existent. If you have a complaint the best thing to do is to keep it to yourself. If you complain about ANYTHING managers will immediately dismiss your complaint saying that you are simply upset. Even other employees will rat you out at the drop of a hat to get on a manager's good side. Overall a good company to work for I guess, but a very frustrating one!"
good,You are in or you are out. It all depends on the store managers. Mine mostly didn't care about you just what you could do for them.
good,The benefits are great and the pay is better than most retail positions. It is a really nice place to work with co-workers. However the management is very poor with little communication and rarely do anything.
good,"The typical work day was a fast pace work day. We just packed out the out the freight that comes in off the truck. I learned how to work different kinds of machinery. The management was so so, they really didn't help out when they needed to. The co-workers where come i didn't have no trouble with them. It really wasn't a hard time doing the job. The job was really simple. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of the employees that worked there"
good,"Reviewing associates performances, working with associates selling skills. Reviewing sales goals and performances by department."
good,"Learned a great deal about the heartlessness of the corporate mentality. I understood the reasons but, could not understand the disregard of the corporate managers for what the loval managers did to the staff. Overall What ever Corporate promised it delivered if you could get the local management to acceed that corporate had it in policy. Most of the time you had to take it to the corporate level in order to make it happen."
good,"Crossed trained in all departments which gave a greater opportunity for advancement throughout the store. Fun place to work as far as floor associates. Working with the management became easier as time went on because at that point what was expected was clearly stated during the many store meetings. I loved that I learned so much in this job. I can now install tile flooring and a toilet, I can also measure the space for doors and windows."
good,i more or less help with getting everything together and help with the mainly manuel labor task's i work under somebody else they do the more technical things
good,Good employee assistance to newcomers
good,Poor technology. Stressful and managment does not appreciate it's employees.
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 3+ years in two different stores, in two very different parts of the country. The company as a whole is pretty good at taking care of their employees. The benefits they offer are some of the best in the retail industry if you can get full-time hours. My first store wasn't bad, and I made a lot of friends that I still chat with every now and then. My second store wasn't as good. My department manager couldn't manage anything, and the store management didn't seem to care. That might be the one weakness for Lowe's as a company that I saw a lot of. The entry level management is poorly developed, and it creates quite a bit of frustration for employees."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers, completing tasks in a timely manner, zoning, and cleaning. I have learned that I work with an excellent group of co-workers even though the management could be better. The hardest part of the job is the high level of stress especially when not able to reach budgets on time. The most enjoyable part is working with such good people and meeting lots of new people everyday."
good,"The job itself is pretty easy to get a grasp on, and most of the people that you work with are nice. The draw back being that sometimes they ask too much of you at one time. You have to put all these questions to the customer(that's not the hard part), but then the customer gets angry and just wants to leave making it hard for you to do your job and make sure they aren't steeling anything either. If you are a people person and can handle grumpy people this job is for you. Oh and don't get sick, even once, or you become a pariah."
good,helping customers. How to lay tile is what I learned. Management helps out. Co-workers are great. Not enough hours. Helping customers is the best.
good,"In this position, I felt my abilities exceeded my job position, but to move up, a business approach was needed."
good,"Great co-workers with a true sense of team work within departments. However, departments work independently of each other and do not communicate enough with one another. The leaders of the company do not know how to get the company where it needs to go. The future of this company is in question."
good,Lowe's is the perfect place for an older person or a college student.
good,"Lowes is an overall good company with a promising future that is leveraged by the MyLowes program. Their willingness to improve customer service is commendable, but the willingness to increase the hours to have the proper floor coverage and maintain store conditions is nonexistent. There are many days that the total of 12- 15 employees will be scheduled on the salesfloor to take care of every customer in a 95k-120k square foot store. IF everyone shows up, it is still difficult to cover lunches and provide the superior customer service that is demanded, but with one person in each department, multiple customers is common. The managers work a 4 week rotation that does not take into account for quality of life or balance with family life. Points of the schedule will have you close 7 of 8 days, covering vacations or special assignments will make the shifts and store coverage even worse. There was not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything they would ask the managers to do on a daily basis. The training is good and the associates want to help, just have to be patient if they are busy. The compensation is market comparable and the benefits are top notch. As an employee, you have to make sure that everything has a price label!!"
good,"I spend the first 4hrs of my shift on the power Equipment, Order Picker & Reach Truk."
good,selling on an active floor up selling the customer by meeting there needs and exceeding them schedualing deliveries following up on quotes tracking product sold
good,"The management was not very understanding. Hours were NOT flexible at all and they ignored most of my requests, not personal requests, I had to attend school certain hours. I was the only one in my department and I didn't depend on any other departments but I was still scheduled around other department schedules. I would have work at 6:30am and there were No customers that early, by the time customers came, they asked me to stay later because they needed help. I told them to schedule me later since I come in so early and do Nothing anyway, they ignored it."
good,Fun Environment key is team work. I learned Working for Lowe's is a Job were you can leave all personal at the door the people that your surround with are so kind as well as the customer there is no way you could have a frown. Although You do have your management team that have there favorites so some work harder than the ones who are most liked by management to move up. The hardest part of my job is dealing with people who make more then me and do nothing i feel Lowe's should give raises to those they see working harder than most.
good,The hardest part of the job is watching your superiors 'deligate' their work to others yet taking all the credit.
good,"There are days where I absolutely LOVE my job. The people you meet, the things that happen makes it an exciting place. It can be rough however, management is disorganized and inconsistent, of course customers can be a handful, but that is to be expected. The hardest part of the job is that when management has a meltdown, and go on the hunt, you start to feel insecure about your job. They make you feel as if you can be replaced at a moment's notice, and the turnover rate proves it. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting genuinely nice people who are kind and knowledgeable."
good,i worked ant all four stores. it was i ok ob but for the time i was there i was not makeing the money there was not i lot of people that came in the shift that i worked
good,"My postion is in customer service.This is returns, sales, internet orders, research past purchases, answer phone calls and middle man between customer and department. This is a difficult job because this is usually the first place the customer goes. Many customers come to you to voice all dissatifaction."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company for the most part. I do however wish that they would have been more understanding and caring to their loyal employees. These employees are some of the best out there in t he retail market. It would be great if this company would realize that they are and treat them with more respect.
good,"I loved Lowe's at first, but I have found it very hard to advance. I worked 2 days a week and submitted 9 applications to a few Lowe's locations in the district. Needless to say, seasonals were hired and I was stuck working just 2 days a week."
good,"Great people to work with, the company had more of a inventory state of mind rather than Loss PRevention."
good,The people are nice employee's and customers. The managers are laid back about scheduling it's not hard to request time off.
good,I mostly enjoyed this job.
good,"Was hired in seasonal...very hard to advance to full time. Management seemed to be a little disorganized. I interviewed for a full time job, but was never contacted after. The two managers that interviewed me left. When I asked the new HR manager about what happened, she told me she could not find any record of me applying for the job or interviewing for the job? I was subsequently laid off."
good,"Customer service is the main portion of the job, if you can provide that your good to go."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a nice environment when working with people on the same level as you. Upper management usually had impossible expectations and would always berate you about not getting them done. Also, there was more external hiring than internal advancement for higher level positions."
good,Lowe's is all about helping customers. They are very good to work for if you have a good supportive management team.
good,"Lowes is a great store really and there are a lot of hard working men and women who do there best to help the customers. But there are also just as many selfish workers as well. Its not surprising that in a larger store the managers will not see that someone is only working when they are around and that there is more corruption in a store that will not be dealt with. The system need some updating but the programs are fine. Its really hard for anyone to advance in because Lowes keeps hiring from outside of the company, and it only seems that they keep making in harder on there associates. Especially when there are extremely good candidates within the store and they hire some idiot who is in a high position that doesn't know anything and is trying to control a dept. but often needs help from the people below them."
good,I like working there but the chance of becoming full time is not happening.
good,Front End Manager managed 40 to 50 employees. While I was employeed at Lowes I took a Entry Managment Training Coarse. Gradated the program. The hardest part about the job was being a single mom and working so many hours and never knew your schedule. I enjoyed working with all different types of people and their personalities. Lowes had great benefits for my family.
good,I learned a lot about different hardware products working with customers
good,"Decent company but wayy too much corporate oversight, not enough room for decision making for store management. Even Interviews are based on computer entrys based on potential candidates answers. Relocating used to be a lot simpler but now its like reapplying for your own job with little chance of success (seen it happen many times). Overall the experience is great, learned more from engaging customers than any training can provide. Depending on the store and its Store Manager, advancement may be rather difficult."
good,Great customer service! Liked seeing people throughout the day.
good,11+ hour days. Recent cut-backs in upper management limit opportunity for advancement.
good,"Very high Customer Service Demand, Can be fun at times, customer make you feel warm and productive at times. Helping with a customer build there dream kitchen or give them product knowledge in appliance is fun. The management is very knowledgeable. The"
good,"My typical day at Lowes would start out as me clocking in and analyze my department and what needed to be done with my department manager since most of the time I was the closing associate. My co-workers in my department were excellent I could not ask for such a perfect team. The hardest part of the job would be at the end of the closing shift when everybody is trying to shut the store down there would be miscommunications with other departments on who would need a helping hand. Most enjoyable parts of the job is seeing customers smile knowing that you took care of their needs. Management to me was a little unorganized and needed some leadership. I have learned here at lowes great customer service, and communication with leadership of a great team."
good,Hard to really explain. They down size yearly and let go of people. Age is a definite issue.
good,A good place to work for entry level people who need experience. Though they are a bit difficult to advance in.
good,"I did not have a great experience with Lowe's. Although they do pay a little better then most retail companies, their availability to work with their employees for time off and requesting early days out is ridiculously bad. They will only promote an individual if that individual is good friends with a member of managment. For me, it was not a good experience."
good,"working here was very fun at first, unfortunately the particular lowe's that i was working at was a little bias towards certain people. it was hard enough to work an hour away from home none the less hate it while i was working. i feel i was treated unfairly amongst my management."
good,Great training and co.workers. Enjoyed work place and the customers. Management was a bit murky at times.
good,"a great place to work at, the benefits are good, the people you work with are okay, you stay busy, the pay is okay"
good,The company has had it set backs in the recent future but I think it will come out of it ok.
good,It was fun in the begininng then idk what happenened. Management got moved around alot and I always ended up with the not so good ones.
good,"The company cares about it's employees and retails feedback from employees. However, management tends to lean towards favoritism at current store. Policy's not enforced unless person violating them was unliked."
good,Employees are nice and friendly. Benefits are pretty good but since the economy went bad the started to take away a lot of the incentives we received such as bonuses.
good,"Their are days where the managers go above and beyond to help you and days where you feel unappreciated. Good pay, but a lot of labor. It's pretty busy throughout your day so it goes by fast."
good,Lowe's is not much different than most retail home improvement. They are geared more towards the homeowner and remodel style. Unfortunately they have tried to become something they are not and are beginning to struggle with what the public image of the company is.
good,This company prioritizes the customer above all things except their bottom line if a customer says one thing and an employee says another the employee is going to be out right disbelieved
good,"Overnight is a great shift to work because there‚Äôs only a few of you working and you can kind of go at your own pace. The only problem is that the hours fluctuate all the time. Some weeks you‚Äôll work 4 days and another week you‚Äôll only work 1. The pay isn‚Äôt that much either. If your looking for a solid part time job that gives 20-25 hours a week, then this is a good place to start. Coworkers are good though."
good,"Unless you are full time of have been there for a while the hours are scarce. Moving up with the company isn‚Äôt as fair as it seems. I was moved to a department after being a cashier but got less hours, no increase in pay, and way more responsibilities."
good,Overall the job was easy. But I was not in a great place mentally and my manager determined that me not trying to make small talk ONE DAY was me having a bad attitude. As someone who is major depressive being told that I was giving a bad attitude for not making small talk with managers only helped to further put me in a bad mental state.
good,"For me, there are a lot of cons to working at this place, however if you're planning to get a part-time job or work exclusively in the summer during the temp season this is always a good fit."
good,Lowe's has good employees and are customer oriented . The pay is not adequate and some of their policies are not fair and some employees are not treated fairly by some of the managers.
good,"All of the time stocking doesn't work when you are supposed to be helping people. Spacing between the plumbing department rough in fashion you get caught helping other people why the people in your department aren't getting the help that they need. And when asked for help with heavy appliances, assistant manager did not complete help! One person should not have to move 20 pieces of washing machines trying to help a customer get out the door out of a tote in the back no help from assistant manager I toted the washing machine and put everything back luckily the lady was still there after extensive amount of time"
good,"A higher pay for being an MSA would be much more enjoyable. The ""time limit"" that you are given per bay is not possible. You can NOT clean, dust, spray paint, and print new labels in 5 minutes."
good,"Horrible management made it hard to effectively accomplish tasks. Low pay, low knowledge. Fun people to work with. The resets are good productive work, however servicing proved to be a complete and utter waste of time."
good,Wish I had a repair job. I am good at sale's. But need more money to live on. I like sales. I'm good at it. Because I know the equipment. Just want moreLike no
good,"Hours are flexible and insurance available. Friendly staff and offer part and full time positions, Enjoy working with associates, offers all around training in different departments."
good,Good place to work if needed. Fast pace and very busy. Co-worker and management are friendly people. Management skills is workable but has room for further improvement.
good,A typical work shift included various routine tasks with some various other tasks and challenges. Very consistent weekly schedule while working overnight.
good,"15 yrs with Lowes, the company was ever changing workplace with great people. A typical day included working with customers as well as tasking to address priorities of the business."
good,"The employees in my department are great to work with. The work atmosphere is somewhat stressful but interesting at times. Although my some of my personal wishes such as more hours, etc aren't granted, i still think Lowe's is a decent place to work for. I would recommend."
good,It is what it is. Good benefits but you are just a number on a corporate level! Management needs to be adjusted! Flexibility of hours is not so good. Not a family oriented company!
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and job duties, but I had to leave due to unresolved and unfair wages. Otherwise, the culture was acceptable and the open opportunities to learn new skills was a plus."
good,"I was employed at Lowes to pay for college and gain work experience. Lowe's is a great place to accomplish those goals, but not for a permanent job. I recommend it to people who are looking to get started on a career path."
good,The management was horrible and refused to communicate.  I worked in the store but was managed by the corporate office.  I watched them give write-ups to the associates for no reason.
good,They will cut hours Around Christmas anywhere from 5 to 15 hours. So if you need hours at Christmas not the place to work at Christmas as a part time associate
good,"Good compensation and benefits in comparison with a lot of other retail that's as big as Lowes. "
good,"Working at Lowe's can depend on the time of year.  The workers are so dedicated and hard working.  I didn't consider Lowe's to be a retail type job, but it is sadly.  With that it brings an influx of quick employment.  The management team is always there. They have a dedicated team.  I enjoyed working with the staff and seeing all the customers."
good,I would recommend working here because it was a great atmosphere and will learn many trades during your time here.  The hardest part about the job is not knowing all the answers for customers.
good,"used to be a lot better until they announced the sale of the millworks facilities we have no idea what is going to happen next. pay is average, benefits are average, hours are good, management is terrible."
good,"There is way too much favoritism at Lowes. I am just so tired of it, and i want to be able to have a somewhat of a set schedule. The company is nice and all i just feel like I need something new. There is no place for me to move up in the company. I just want to maybe get out of retail and see what else there is for me to. I really want to work in an office maybe doing scheduling and helping others."
good,The people you work with are usually good people. The management is sub par and they don‚Äôt really care about their employees. Most of the time you have to fin for yourself if you want any help from a manager.
good,"I've learned few things on my own : assembled all the snow blowers plus prepared orders for delivery in the morning. Got injured while assembling a snowblower , was difficult to get management to write an accident report.."
good,I like the fact that I‚Äôm dealing with tools all day cause that‚Äôs what I love to do but I rather be out doors working with them to build something rather than inside.
good,I think that lowe's is actually a good but I'm looking for a better job where I can have more of a choice of what I want to do. Lowe's isn't a bad job though I'm just in a position I don't want to be in right now.
good,"Lowe's is on of the better organizations to work for in retail. However, the retail industry has inconsistent hours, minimal advancement opportunities, and prioritizes seniority over education."
good,My time at Lowe's pay I've been productive and learning from certain management while other management too keen on destroying someone's lifestyle career.
good,I was released from my job for something that was not my fault. I violated company safety regulations unknownst to me while using a forklift. My spotter disappeared while I continued to work. He did not tell me he was helping another customer. I had no idea he was even gone until a member of the receiving team told me I had no spotter support
good,You never have enough time to get things done the right way. If you worked their for a while you will notice different things. You will start filling that you are doing more than the other person and of course some for the management only wants to hand things off on you and not take care of anything.
good,"Lowes is a good place to work they help you and show you what you need to do."
good,"Job is rough and doesn't let up very often. But if you are a delivery driver, you are gone from the morning until evening and the direct management is generally behind you if something goes wrong."
good,"follow the rules or feel enormous pressure. exceed the goals or feel enormous pressure. Be perfect, make no mistakes or feel enormous pressure. Always looking over your shoulder afraid of being fired. Job roles and positions change or are added or eliminated every year or two."
good,"Evolving company, a lot of changes making it uncomfortable with job security. They do give back to the community, and they try to do employee events, but employees do not get involved."
good,Lowe's is always look to hire young talent and works well with your schedule if you are part time. As a full-time associate I am always guaranteed my 40 hours a week. The benefits are really good and the associates are good people to work with.
good,The store I worked for was a test store for a lot of things. The work was horrid but manageable. The only reason I have a back experience is due to the massive down sizing. The company ended up firing some of the best people and leaving the ones who we not in high performance areas. The company was deciding to split work loads among less skilled people.
good,"Overall, working there was a great experience. The opportunity added another job under my belt while also showing me what I was capable of handling with customer service. I learned to multitask and how to handle working under pressure. Management was very poor over time."
good,Will miss my work family.  The company seems to have lost its culture.  Typically understaffed and hard to retain good people.  Facing store closure and not seeing much corporate support.
good,"Once management changed, so did the staff I was laid off.  The company downsized and took away positions and people were laid off. All within a  month's time."
good,"I worked at Lowes for about 6 months, hired as a seasonal employee. Soon I realized that I was (presumably) the lowest paid cashier out of all the other new hires. In an attempt to be proactive, I confronted management and they gave me the whole, ""management speech"". ""Everyone starts at your salary. Don't believe what other people say..."" All lies. I told them I was looking to leave and they offered me a raise because they did not want to lose me."
good,"There's too many changes they're trying to add with no idea how to add it. Management is never there when you need it (especially after they lock away half the things you need) and they're making hours less flexible. Also, don't be surprised when you get a large load with only 2 people to unload it yet a full 6 person crew when the truck is basically empty. I enjoy the co-workers, but management and corporate will screw you over."
good,It is a job with ok benifits but the work schedule is not at all family friendly. Seems like each store manager has their own set of rules and regulations.
good,"Lowe‚Äôs started off as a great place to work. Great people, competitive pay and opportunity to advance. A lot of changes have taken a toll on morale, from scheduling changes to lay offs, to lack of people there to service the customers. Seems like customer service will be taking a hit because all that matters is the bottom line. Hopefully this will change. I feel the CEO has the best business intentions so it is still a good company to work for."
good,"C'est tr√®s enrichissant de travailler chez Lowe's, mais le taux de roulement est haut et ce n'est pas pour rien. Le travail peut √™tre exigeant, il y a peu de flexibilit√© sur le t√©l√©travail (mais j'ai entendu la rumeur que √ßa allait peut-√™tre changer), et on n'a pas un tr√®s grand sentiment d'appartenance. Je suis contente d'avoir travaill√© dans cette compagnie, mais quand ma manager m'a demand√© o√π je me voyais dans 5 ans, ce n'√©tait malheureusement pas chez Lowe's"
good,On  a typical  day at  lowes  i would  spend  majority  of  cleaning  the  store  and  picking  up things  in your  designated  area( mines  was plumbing)
good,The store manager was good. ASM was an idiot and Corporate is trying to destroy all work-life balance. only 1 weekend off every 2 months and work at all times of the day sometimes you close and then open right away
good,"Management needs to apply best practices and consider customer service.  Inconsistency between stores. Needs better security to avoid theft, and allow action by those providing security."
good,"I got hired as a cashier. I broke my ankle, & there's no availability for that for a cashier, so when I was healthy, there wasn't any openings, so my disability leave expired, as did my employment."
good,"It is a very stressful place to work, there were day's when I would leave work in tears just because management would not back me in anything that I did"
good,"Was hired as a nursery specialist but spent 65-75% of my time loading very heavy block, soil, mulch etc. Very little time for customer interaction, new schedule requires 10 hour days and then 1/2 days, no set schedule."
good,Took management way to long to approve military leave for AT after it had been denied twice. Coworker are nice and friendly and the job is easy enough.
good,"typical big box retail. rude overly entitled customers, inept and deluded CEO, 90% of the work delegated to 20% of the employee with more duties added regularly and no increase in pay or benefits to make up for it. "
good,"The company has every shifting policies and such that change with no warning and seemingly no rhyme or reason, especially when it comes to scheduling. Management competency and behavior varies by location. The benefits, the higher than normal rate of pay for my area, and consistent 39 hour work weeks at full time are the only reason I'm still here."
good,The days are generally good busy on the weekend. Busy during holidays for special sales. Most everyone you can work with. Management is good for departments but not necessarily for the store manager or assistant managers.
good,"Really don't care about the employees as they say they do.. it's all a show... It's a ""what have you done lately and not what we have done or given."".."
good,"Liked my job well enough, had great coworkers.  The biggest problem of the store is the management in store and questionable corporate directions. I would go back but for two managers if they are still there I won't be. I truly hope management in this location changes for the sake of my former coworkers."
good,Very bad hour swings. No room for family planning. Way too much extreme favorable behavior among management and general associated . Too much playing and not enough serious work. Don‚Äôt want to work here again
good,"I wasn't able to do my job because I was busy helping others with theirs, and I was also in school at the time and they constantly tried to hold me back after the time I was scheduled"
good,They are always hiring because people don't tend to stay long when they are overworked and underpaid. If you are not looking for a career move you go here for a job.
good,"I worked over and beyond I always worked hard but corp.  Doesn't care how good you are they care for that money."
good,"Simple stocking procedures. New system involves unloading truck then stocking. (10 -12 hour shifts ). The people you work with are great. Hard working people who do what it takes to get things done. But pay for the work is grossly under compensated. Working 40 hours a week over time with bachelors deserves higher pay. My store makes 1 million a week and 300,000.00 in profit the least they can do is pay their troops a truly fair wage (15.00 hr) Furthermore, I know that the managers and the managers Supervisors are simply doing what they are told. So if CEO reads this know overnights are crucial and will do anything to provide for the company if adequate pay is granted (15.00 min) Thank you."
good,"Very quiet environment, good team members, and good working environment. But over all the management is very serious to team, feels always secure. But over all its ok."
good,"I loved to work with certain members of my team, just some issues with scheduling flexibility, i worked there a year and a half part time working any time they needed me."
good,Since the start of the new CEO the company went from family Orientated to what family! Constant changes and losing positions to make share holders happy that is killing the workers moral.
good,"So to start I only worked at Lowe‚Äôs for a brief short time, most the management was fantastic. Super kind and overall incredibly helpful. Just certain employees loved to throw their weight around and show favoritism. My first day there I got warned to ‚Äúlook busy‚Äù or the head cashier will start something with me. Which I found out was actually true. Just too much drama overall"
good,I worked at Lowe's as a seasonal cashier and my experience was great at  first but it got worse over time. Management had some issues but I loved the people I worked with.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but the management is poor and even if you do move up it's a high possibility you'll get canned eventually and replaced with someone newer for less money. I've seen too many times where people who've been with the company 20+ years get fired and replaced with someone less qualified and under paid!"
good,I did not enjoy the retail business hours but they were very understanding of that and worked with me and I was able to figure out the schedule that worked for me
good,"I enjoyed working with the plants and the customers, working outdoors was nice and the flowers provided a nice atmosphere. Merchandising and sorting tasks were fun to do."
good,This place was great then the higher ups started making a bunch of changes that had a negative impact on the company and the people that work here to make more money for themselves
good,Sometimes I have to come in early morning to start at 5am.Have to be very organized to perform this job. Decent work environment. Management is a bit out of touch. Good Co-workers/people overall. They monitor your over time. Not enough people to cover shifts or help you from other departments.You have to work most weekend and Holidays. Pay is decent but not enough to cover workload.
good,"For management, long hours, on average 60 hour work weeks. I would often work 10 days in a row with out a day off. I never had a weekend off. The salary and bonus were good, the 401K and discount stock options were a real benefit. But I basically lived at that store."
good,"A full time employee will work 40 hours a week with a rotating schedule that can be very frustrating at times. Depending on department coverage your schedule can be all over the place.  Day to day you work with customers to sell projects and help them find items that may not even exist because the inventory is always a disaster.  The inventory system is ran through the archaic genesis software that is simply outdated.  Communication was always an issue from management down, installers constantly had issues and you are left unappreciated for these struggles.  Every corporate change seemed detached from reality only further putting a wrench in a broken system.  Employees not showing up for work leaves other departments stranded to handle other peoples work.  Employees beneath management were constantly complaining and seem quite unhappy.  Most chance for advancement within the company   The only benefit is a stock program and benefits but for most it isn't even worth it but for some they will never leave."
good,"Many resent changes by the new CEO, specifically in scheduling which does not permit a family/worklife balance.  Unable to plan any family events or medical appointments beyond three weeks.  Never knowing days off in advance. I'm a full time employee, yet my scheduled hours per day range from 5-11 hours on any given day. This one change caused major turn over rates to increase dramatically."
good,"When I first started Lowe‚Äôs all the management was great and very supportive. As I advanced, it seemed like they didn‚Äôt care anymore. The people are great"
good,I enjoy working and helping customers at lowes. It's a friendly work environment. I work and help all of our customers in each department. You work and learn as you go because that's what we are here for to assist and make our customers happy.
good,"Lowe's is what you'd expect working at a retailer. Kinda sucks but it can be a good first job. Pay is terrible. For the title (Truck unloader/stocker) I worked, there was only one full-time position. The rest were part-time only."
good,Tough environment to work in as a sales professional now days.  Culture is more about cheapest price rather than best product to fit customer needs.  This is not the fault of Lowes specifically.
good,"I enjoyed the team-based activities of working at Lowes, but avoid getting hired in the Lumber/Loading department if possible. It's heavy impact with poor compensation unless you've been there for years. I tried to transfer to a different department after my season was up and despite getting interviewed several times and having a flawless attendance record my department manager kept stopping the transfer because of how understaffed we were at the time. He ended up taking an interview I did for part-time paint department and just using that to hire me on as a part-time lumber associate. Basically, it's an okay job but they stick you wherever they need someone with little-to-no training. Not to mention, every customer assumes you have the knowledge and skill-set of a carpenter."
good,"I would go to work and work in different area;s of the store ex: Lumber, front and garden, I worked at the customer service desk for eight months and I really enjoyed it. there was a lot of favoritism with management and the employees really noticed it"
good,"I worked in customer service prior to this for 19 + years in a more controlled atmosphere befor Lowes. Retail was a big shock. It wasn't the customers, more management that made me look elsewhere for a career other than this. The money paid for the job being done for such a large company, wasn't great"
good,For the most part it‚Äôs a pretty good job just like any other you will have them bad days but I think the management need to improve then everything else will fall into place.
good,"Usually busy from start to finish, have to be motivated to learn, most training is on the job, becoming management is hard to achieve, laid back atmosphere, under staffed regularly, teamwork a must, coworkers make the job worth coming to, and there are great benefits ( 401k matching, vacation, yearly raises, healthcare)."
good,"Understaffed severely. Horrible hours. One day you might be working 2-11p.m. and the next 5:30a.m.- 2:30p.m. Its a good seasonal or temporary job, but not a career."
good,"-Stressful, fast paced environment, constant change, inconsistent leadership and follow up, customer service levels, pro customers are important, relationship building"
good,"THE GOOD: Great co-workers, most managers are approachable and helpful, good pay and full benefits."
good,"The people I had met there was great and some of the supervisors were amazing to work with, however the environment was a tad lazy and some people flat out did not like their jobs. The customers were constantly angry, though not all the time, just most of the time. It was an alright experience, but I don't think I'd recommend people to work here unless they need experience in retail."
good,"Unfortunately this once great company has fallen victim to keeping share holders happy and having little to no concern for its employees. This is a job, not a career. You can get chopped at any moment due to constant down-sizing."
good,"Lowes, after coming from home depot, is years behind. But as they evolve they are taking strides to close the technology gap and the marketing gag, however the culture is very cold and I wouldn't recommend for job security reasons."
good,"Working with Lowe‚Äôs for several years there have been several changes through out the company. Lowe‚Äôs is an employer that requires associates to get used to change often. With position roles and policy changes happening all the time, it‚Äôs hard to keep up."
good,"LOWE's is a decent company to work for but as with all big companies it has its pitfalls. First off and probably my biggest complaint is that as a sales specialist I am locked into salary with only COLA from here on out. There is talk of possible mid year merit raises but I am not holding my breath and that would mean my raise would be a whole .80 cents by the end of the year...if it happens. Life/work balance suffers as full time employees only get one weekend and one Sunday off a month. Management does work with you to get vacation time scheduled and at least your days off are in a set pattern to where you can plan. "
good,"Hours were long and work was hard, especially for the pay (but I worked overnights). Day-shift seemed a lot more laid back and less stressful. They provide great benefits especially if you have a family."
good,"Lowe's had been a good company to work for, they now talk about customer service yet seem to e running associates out of the store. Management is very good at managing things and very bad a managing the people that take care of customers and the things they want to manage."
good,I wouldn't recommend.  They tell you what you want to hear to draw u in. Then they stick you in the very unfamilar department they said they wouldn't put you in after telling you you would be placed in the department you want. Then you're stuck and it is lots of heavy backbreaking work and dealing with customers when you have such a work load placed on you is tough. Hardest job ever and I
good,Cashier position was easy and enjoyed meeting customers. there is plenty of opportunities to advance to higher positions.  I enjoyed the training programs on computer.
good,"You are given jobs you have never done and given no training, no employee to shadow, and supervision is not available or unable to help. If you are lucky other employees will be helpful but piecemeal. BUT you are expected to do the job. Pay is low, they hire who they want, when they want, in positions they want without consideration to existing employees talents. Some days you work one hour ((scheduled for6) and sent home because sales were low yesterday(are scheduled for 6"
good,"Enjoyed the Lowe's environment. Busy most of the time. Benefits were pretty good. Management could have been better but, they changed the business model and got rid of the ones who played fair, and the other good ones left."
good,"The survey was difficult to answer.  Lowe‚Äôs, the culture, the compensation and benefits changed dramatically over the 13 years I worked there.  Had I taken that after my 8th year there it would have scored much higher.  The last five years I worked there as well as my wife still works there changed my judging of the company significantly. It‚Äôs the transition from a company in the midst of great growth to a company that has plagued yet trying to keep stock returns  the same as they were during the growth."
good,"Fun and friendly work environment that inspires teamwork and helping each other towards a common goal of providing the best service to customers, all through teamwork"
good,Great employees to work with as well as the management team. The best part was working with repeat customers on different projects and providing alternative solutions to customers needs.
good,"The store has gone downhill since the latest department manager layoff. good place to work if you need work part time, but not somewhere i want to continue a career"
good,My time at lowe's was good. they offer a lot of training. they have great benefits. It is a great place to learn job skills for young people starting out.
good,"Busy work environment, worked with a fun group of people. Loved my job and work family. My job position as the FSA was terminated at Lowe's and I was terminated with no warning."
good,"When I started working for this company there were cash incentives and a feeling that the employees really mattered as a team. That is certainly not the case now. The employees are treated with no respect. It was a really good place to work at one time. They have really good insurance and 401K though, so it has it's good points."
good,I truly enjoyed every day at work. The pacing was a perfect balance of customer and product assistance. I will say that the store I worked at had big holes in their management team. Specifically the Store Manager had no social skills and was disrespectful to even the most loyal employees. Most found him to be unbearable to talk to since any idea was immediately shot down or insulted. Work atmosphere on the front end (cashiers and customer service) was riddled with issues and the managers don't care to solve the problem.
good,Overall working at Lowe‚Äôs was a good place to work. Management just wasn‚Äôt together they could talk all day and not do anything but you would get in trouble for talking to a co worker those people  wasn‚Äôt fair . I was a seasonal employee they let me go but kept other employees who was suppose to leave when I left which wasn‚Äôt fair. Lowe‚Äôs Company Sucks.
good,"My day started at 04:00 A.M.everyday and was complete at 1:00 P.M. My day consisted of 2 hours of janitorial work for the first 2 hours, then I spent  1 hour reviewing work orders, submitting work orders and following up with outside vendors. The last part of my day typically consisted of working on equipment and overall facility maintenance."
good,Only way its worth it is of you're working full time. Palmdale 47th st e sucks with hours unless ur full time. Management sucks and so does scheduling.
good,"I love the people I work with, and the physical work involved. But management tends to abuse the employees based on customer issues. Also the company as a whole has been eliminating positions and I fear delivery is next on the chopping block."
good,The people you work with are going to be the best and worst part and the worst. Same goes for the customers. Management is kind of a disaster but you can't blame a company's structure on the managers.
good,Lowe's can be a great place to work as long as there is a good Management Staff.  I enjoyed working in the Paint Department and Administrative Office the most because I could work at my own pace and not be micromanaged.
good,Lowe's is a fun place to work but the management to me wasn't very good in certain ways. We were low on staff for a long time and the job was only getting more difficult and never went back to the way it should.
good,"often brought in food for employees and offers discounts, however I found that a good amount of the time we were under staffed. The employees were super friendly with each other and 2/3 of the 5/6 managers were nice. Seemed like you would only move up if you had connections."
good,Management was horrible. I recently heard that manager is no longer there. So maybe it is a better place to work now. Each store is different though..
good,Lowes is a pretty good job for someone to work full time with no kids and not much of a responsibilities. They do have a good work environment but they lack the proper need of management.
good,Lowe's was a very active environment that I enjoyed working in. The only thing I did not like this job was I was never aloud to receive enough hours.I would for sure work at Low's again if I could receive the hours and better pay.
good,"I put in 41 applications to move from cashier but never once in 1.5 yrs got an interview.  I am a good worker,  dependable and liked working there until i realized that there was absolutely no chance for advancement.  When they posted an opening they already knew who they were going to fill that position with.  Frustrating."
good,"Good pay, good people. It can just get quite stressful. The gap between expectation versus the reality of what a single employee can do could use some narrowing."
good,Loved it but wasint what I thought it was gonna be work slowed down then it was off of work for awhile so stopped doing it now was recently working at meijer but the hours wornt that great so looking for something new
good,I enjoyed lowes at certain times with certain managers. It's hard to promote in lowes. I enjoyed the paint department and cashiering. It was a good job until I decided to go to school.
good,"It was a good place to work, but it has changed a lot over the last year with new corporate management. Key positions were eliminated in the stores leading to great employees being laid off."
good,as a seasonal part time I wasn't there long enough to give an honest opinion. Working two jobs there wasn't enough hours in the day to work both for any length of time as my full time job was ramping up quicker than normal
good,My time at Lowe's was cut short due to management change. I decided the company was no longer a fit for me and my family. I truly enjoyed my coworkers and loved my old manager. But things change.
good,Needs to work on their work culture environment. Too many negative attitudes in the store. In store is under staffed. If you like hours and freedom then delivery is the way to go (outside the store). Receiving employees (in store) can be negative and ruff people but hard workers. That's because their underpaid and understaffed and over worked.
good,Typical retail worker experience. Expected to work efficiently to meet customer needs. Sometimes have to deal with unpleasant and/or unsatisfied customer. Frequent changes in management.
good,"With current retail environment going to online,  person to person customer service jobs are being eliminated.  Lowes has begun consolidating positions."
good,"It great place to learn customer service skills. All kind of customers are dealt with on a daily basis. It is a great advancement job, if you can handle dealing with all kind of people."
good,This has been a company where your co-workers are your family away from home.  I am able to work independently and show my work ethics and ability to meet deadlines.
good,"In the 5 years I work for Lowe‚Äôs I took one lesson away from it. Management will promise you anything to get what they want and will not deliver on their promises. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it is regarding your schedule, pay, or training they WILL NOT FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR PROMISES!!!"
good,"I enjoyed Working at Lowe's."
good,"The lowes on 424 W. Patriot, Derby, KS, 67037 is a decent place to work"
good,"Lowe's is a great company! I absolutely love working for Lowe's, however pay is low and management is lazy. You get your regular customers and then you get you occasional DIY shoppers."
good,"For as much as they talk about working as a team, they really don't do much to give any meaning to that idea. There's an extreme lack of comradery that stems from poor management and corporate decision making that leaves you questioning whose job is next on the chopping block. Customers are always an issue because they feel entitled because they're apart of the boomer generation who are used to getting kisses at the foot whenever they're slightly inconvenienced, so telling them ""no"" is unheard of and the end of the world. Contractors and construction workers have a chip on their shoulder and think they're better than everyone who works in that store for whatever reason. So ultimately the job leaves you worn out and emotionally exhausted from all of the ridiculousness experienced at the store. Even if you are someone who doesn't let things get to you, you'll break at some point at Lowe's. Retail at Lowe's is a whole other animal that I would advise not attempting to wrangle."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, especially when first starting out at the job and you're still learning the ropes. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with coworkers and pleasant customers and making their day. At the front end, business is busy for the most part, but be prepared to make yourself busy in case customer traffic slows down."
good,"I loved being at Lowe's in the beginning. It was amazing energy and easy scheduling. After 5 months things changed. The scheduling was horrible they would change times when you would have to work without letting you know ahead of time. They would cut hours a lot. And if you were sick or had a doctor's note they wouldn't care you still had to come into work or call them. And even though I loved my job and staff it was hard for me to leave, but what made it easy was the scheduling."
good,I liked working there but it did not support my family enough so I had to get a better paying job.its a great place to start when your just coming out of school
good,Good place to get Customer service experience . Very Customer Service focused. Very friendly atmosphere good at training employees. No a long term gig to elevate in the company.  High turn over rate
good,"They expect to please every customer with delivery times but also stay on a strict schedule.  So for example, if you have worked 10 hrs and its 5pm but you have a scheduled stop at 6pm then you are stuck waiting until that time but somehow also not work overtime.  The people are great and nice to work with.  Hardest part was having an insane amount of deliveries but expected to do it on the customer's time yet not do over time"
good,"Each day was generally busy and often had no time for downtime other than scheduled breaks and lunches. I learned that even if you were not necessarily knowledgable regarding what a customer needed, a courteous attitude and a willingness to help often ent a long way. The management was irritable but respected you if they saw that you regularly worked hard. The culture was often nice, but tension may rise on a busy day."
good,I was there as a temp working about 30-40 hrs per week. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Around Memorial Day weekend it got a little chaotic and I was scheduled to work long hours all weekend. Management is very strict and not very understanding when it comes to requesting time off.
good,"Personally, Lowe's has treated my very well.  Working with my school schedule all the way up to a management position in the company.  There is a lot of negative feedback from a lot of associates, and sure, some of it is called for.  However, the majority just seems to be the same people constantly complaining and never attempting to do anything to change.  You get what you give. I worked hard and showed those around and above me they quality of worker I was, so when opportunities of advancement came, I got them.  The issue with Lowe's, as it is with all retail, is the balance of home life and work.  working until 11pm and then having to be back at 8am, then 2pm then 6am.  There is no sleep pattern, and trying to commit to anything is virtually impossible."
good,"Outside of a poorly manged facility, the job was pretty easy and i enjoyed going to work. They definitely need to work on better management. If that happened i would be more than willing to go back to the company."
good,"Everybody works together very well, but management and CEO is terrible trying to run the place, if your young you will not advance, they judge very bad."
good,Good company to work for in retail. Not great but they will accompany you if you are a valued team member. Pay is decent for retail if you move up the ladder.
good,"Fast paced environment. Benefits were good but the people you worked with was not fair. Alot of favoritism in this field, management was horrible. The pay rate as long as I been there was not great"
good,There always hired from outside for management; they never hired from within. The hardest part of the job was customer service. The best of the job was people I worked with.
good,"The management was a little rough, scheduling was a mess, and your fellow employees sometimes were a little harsh. Get paid good though, good training experience, and it can be both layed back or fast paced."
good,"Typical Corporate structure, as long as you do your job you are fairly secure. Advancement and promotions are sometimes plagued by the ""Who you know"" issue. Benefits are reasonable but not exceptional."
good,"Working for Lowes is pretty easy, but only if the schedule accounts for proper coverage of your respective department. And if you've ever shopped at Lowes, you probably know that this isn't usually the case as you spend a good amount of time looking for someone available to help you. Also those in upper management are pretty out of touch with the daily experiences of employees and often make baffling and/or unreasonable demands. All that said, the pay is fair and it's a great place to acquire some useful skills involving everyday home maintenance and improvement."
good,"Loved the people I worked with and for; hated the hours and what the hard concrete floors did to feet and back."
good,a lot of the people didn't have good work ethics  had to pick up the load for other people.   the ones that would work were great to work with.  very stressful when you had a big order to load and the guys were no where to be found
good,Was not happy after the new store manager came to our store. He had his chosen few anyone else was chop liver. After I left I wouldn't even shop at that lowes. Hardly do to this day
good,"everyday is basically the same, help customers, some are rude and some are nice"
